computer systems from attack, which could delay adoption of new technologies. any of these actions by customers could adversely affect our revenue. in addition, if third parties gain access to our networks or data centers they could obtain and exploit confidential business information and harm our competitive position. finally, actual or perceived vulnerabilities may lead to claims against us. although our license agreements typically contain provisions that eliminate or limit our exposure to such liability, there is no assurance these provisions will withstand all legal challenges.  improper disclosure of personal data could result in liability and harm our reputation.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0we store and process large amounts of personally identifiable information as we sell software, provide support and offer cloud-based services to customers. it is possible that our security controls over personal data, our training of employees and vendors on data security, and other practices we follow may not prevent the improper disclosure of personally identifiable information. improper disclosure of this information could harm our reputation, lead to legal exposure to customers, or subject us to liability under laws that protect personal data, resulting in increased costs or loss of revenue. our software products and services also enable our customers to store and process personal data. perceptions that our products or services do not adequately protect the privacy of personal information could inhibit sales of our products or services.  we may experience outages, data loss and disruptions of our online services if we fail to maintain an adequate operations infrastructure.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0our increasing user traffic and complexity of our products and services demand more computing power. we have spent and expect to continue to spend substantial amounts to purchase or lease data centers and equipment and to upgrade our technology and network infrastructure to handle increased traffic on our web sites and in our data centers, and to introduce new products and services and support existing services such as bing, exchange online, sharepoint online, xbox live, windows live, and microsoft office web apps. we also are growing our business of providing a platform and back-end hosting for services provided by third-party businesses to their end customers. maintaining and expanding this infrastructure is expensive and complex. inefficiencies or operational failures, including temporary or permanent loss of customer data, could diminish the quality of our products, services, and user experience resulting in contractual liability, claims by customers and other third parties, damage to our reputation and loss of current and potential users, subscribers, and advertisers, each of which may harm our operating results and financial condition.  we are subject to government litigation and regulatory activity that affects how we design and market our products.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0as a leading global software maker, we receive close scrutiny from government agencies under u.s. and foreign competition laws. some jurisdictions also provide private rights of action for competitors or consumers to assert claims of anti-competitive conduct. for example, we have been involved in the following actions.  lawsuits brought by the u.s. department of justice, 18 states, and the district of columbia in two separate actions were resolved through a consent decree that took effect in 2001 and a final judgment entered in 2002. these proceedings imposed various constraints on our windows operating system businesses. these constraints include limits on certain contracting practices, mandated disclosure of certain software program interfaces and protocols, and rights for computer manufacturers to limit the visibility of certain windows features in new pcs. we believe we are in full compliance with these rules. however, if we fail to comply with them, additional restrictions could be imposed on us that would adversely affect our business.  the european commission closely scrutinizes the design of high-volume microsoft products and the terms on which we make certain technologies used in these products, such as file formats, programming interfaces, and protocols, available to other companies. in 2004, the commission ordered us to create new versions of windows that do not include certain multimedia technologies and to provide our competitors with specifications for how to implement certain proprietary windows communications protocols in their own products. in 2009, the commission accepted a set of commitments offered by microsoft to address the commission\u0092s concerns relating to competition in web browsing software. the commission\u0092s impact on product design may limit our ability to innovate in windows or other products in the future, diminish the developer appeal of the windows platform, and increase our product development costs. the availability of licenses related to protocols and file formats may enable competitors to develop software products that better mimic the functionality of our own products which could result in decreased sales of our\u00a0products.  \u00a0 17 "

disruptions in the supply chain may result in console shortages that would affect our revenues and operating margins. these same risks would apply to any other vertically-integrated hardware and software products we may offer.  if our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets become impaired we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states (\u0093u.s. gaap\u0094), we review our amortizable intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually. factors that may be considered a change in circumstances, indicating that the carrying value of our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets may not be recoverable, include a decline in stock price and market capitalization, reduced future cash flow estimates, and slower growth rates in our industry. we may be required to record a significant charge in our financial statements during the period in which any impairment of our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets is determined, negatively impacting our results of operations.  we operate a global business that exposes us to additional risks.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0we operate in over 100 countries and a significant part of our revenue comes from international sales. pressure to make our pricing structure uniform might require that we reduce the sales price of our software in the united states and other countries. operations outside  \u00a0 19 "
