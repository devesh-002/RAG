affected. effective succession planning is also important to our long-term success. failure to ensure effective transfer of knowledge and smooth transitions involving key employees could hinder our strategic planning and execution.  delays in product development schedules may adversely affect our revenues.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0the development of software products is a complex and time-consuming process. new products and enhancements to existing products can require long development and testing periods. significant delays in new product releases or significant problems in

continue to make significant investments in research, development, and marketing for new products, services, and technologies, including windows vista, the 2007 microsoft office system, xbox 360, live

effective distribution and marketing. we may not achieve significant revenue from new product and service investments for a number of years, if at all. moreover, new products and services may not be profitable, and even if they are profitable, operating margins for new products and businesses may not be as high as the margins we have experienced historically.  adverse economic conditions may harm our business.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0inflation, softness in corporate information technology spending, or other changes in general economic conditions that affect demand for computer hardware or software could adversely affect our revenue or our investment portfolio. if overall market demand for pcs, servers, and other computing devices declines significantly, or consumer or corporate spending for such products declines, our revenue will be adversely affected. in addition, our revenue would be unfavorably impacted if customers reduce their purchases of new software products or upgrades because new offerings such as windows vista and the 2007 microsoft office system are not perceived as providing significant new functionality or other value to prospective purchasers.  we have claims and lawsuits against us that may result in adverse outcomes.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0we are subject to a variety of claims and lawsuits. adverse outcomes in some or all of the claims pending against us may result in significant monetary damages or injunctive relief against us that could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business. although management currently believes that resolving all of these matters, individually or in the aggregate, will not have a material adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows, the litigation and other claims are subject to inherent uncertainties and management\u0092s view of these matters may change in the future. there exists the possibility of a material adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows for the period in which the effect of an unfavorable final outcome becomes probable and reasonably estimable.  we may have additional tax liabilities.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0we are subject to income taxes in both the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions. significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes. in the ordinary course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. we are regularly under audit by tax authorities. although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals. the results of an audit or litigation could have a material effect on our income tax provision, net income or cash flows in the period or periods for which that determination is made.  our consumer hardware products may experience quality or supply problems.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0our hardware products such as the xbox 360 console are highly complex and can have defects in design, manufacture or associated software. we could incur significant expenses, lost revenue, and reputational harm if we fail to detect or effectively address such issues through design, testing or warranty repairs.  we obtain some components of our hardware devices from sole suppliers. if a component delivery from a sole-source supplier is delayed or becomes unavailable or industry shortages occur, we may be unable to obtain replacement supplies on a timely basis, resulting in reduced sales. either component shortages or excess inventory may require us to record charges to cost of revenue. xbox 360 consoles are assembled in asia; disruptions in the supply chain may result in console shortages that would affect our revenues and operating margins.  \u00a0 \u00a0   "

cumulative effect of the application of this consensus on prior period results should be recognized through a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the year of adoption. elective retrospective application is also permitted. we do not expect the application of this consensus to have a material impact on our financial statements.  in fiscal year 2007, we adopted staff accounting bulletin (\u0093sab\u0094) no.\u00a0108, considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying current year misstatements. sab no.\u00a0108 requires companies to quantify misstatements using both a balance sheet (iron curtain) and an income statement (rollover) approach to evaluate whether either approach results in an error that is material in light of relevant quantitative and qualitative factors, and provides for a one-time cumulative effect transition adjustment. the adoption of sab no.\u00a0108 did not have an impact on our financial statements.  in september 2006, the fasb issued sfas no.\u00a0157, fair value measurements, which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. sfas no.\u00a0157 does not require any new fair value measurements, but provides guidance on how to measure fair value by providing a fair value hierarchy used to classify the source of the information. this statement is effective for us beginning july\u00a01, 2008. we currently are assessing the potential impact that adoption of sfas no.\u00a0157 would have on our financial statements.  in february 2007, the fasb issued sfas no.\u00a0159, the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities. sfas no.\u00a0159 gives us the irrevocable option to carry many financial assets and liabilities at fair values, with changes in fair value recognized in earnings. sfas no.\u00a0159 is effective for us beginning july\u00a01, 2008, although early adoption is permitted. we are currently assessing the potential impact that adoption of sfas no.\u00a0159 will have on our financial statements.  application of critical accounting policies  our financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with u.s. gaap. preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. these estimates and assumptions are affected by management\u0092s application of accounting policies. critical accounting policies for us include revenue recognition, impairment of investment securities, impairment of goodwill, accounting for research and development costs, accounting for legal contingencies, accounting for income taxes, and accounting for stock-based compensation.  we account for the licensing of software in accordance with american institute of certified public accountants statement of position (\u0093sop\u0094) 97-2, software revenue recognition. the application of sop 97-2 requires judgment, including whether a software arrangement includes multiple elements, and if so, whether vendor-specific objective evidence (\u0093vsoe\u0094) of fair value exists for those elements. for some of our products, customers receive certain elements of our products over a period of time. these elements include free post-delivery telephone support and the right to receive unspecified upgrades/enhancements of microsoft internet explorer on a when-and-if-available basis. the fair value of these elements is recognized over the estimated life cycle for the windows xp and previous pc operating systems. for windows vista, there are no significant undelivered elements and accordingly, no license revenue is deferred for windows vista sales. changes to the elements in a software arrangement, the ability to identify vsoe for those elements, the fair value of the respective elements, and changes to a product\u0092s estimated life cycle could materially impact the amount of earned and unearned revenue. judgment is also required to assess whether future releases of certain software represent new products or upgrades and enhancements to existing products.  sfas no.\u00a0115, accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities, and sab topic 5m, accounting for noncurrent marketable equity securities, provide guidance on determining when an investment is other-than-temporarily impaired. investments are reviewed quarterly for indicators of other-than-temporary impairment. this determination requires significant judgment. in making this judgment, we employ a systematic methodology quarterly that considers available quantitative and qualitative evidence in evaluating potential impairment of our investments. if the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value, we evaluate, among other factors, general market conditions, the duration and extent to which the fair value is less than cost, and our intent and ability to hold the investment. we also consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of and business outlook for the investee, including industry and sector performance, changes in technology, operational and financing cash flow factors, and rating agency actions. once a decline in fair value is determined to be other-than-temporary, an impairment charge is   \u00a0 \u00a0   "

we may incur future impairments.  sfas no.\u00a0142, goodwill and other intangible assets, requires that goodwill be tested for impairment at the reporting unit level (operating segment or one level below an operating segment) on an annual basis (july 1 for us) and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. these events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate, legal factors, operating performance indicators, competition or sale or disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit. application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment, including the identification of reporting units, assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units, assignment of goodwill to reporting units, and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit. the fair value of each reporting unit is estimated using a discounted cash flow methodology. this requires significant judgments including estimation of future cash flows, which is dependent on internal forecasts, estimation of the long-term rate of growth for our business, the useful life over which cash flows will occur, and determination of our weighted average cost of capital. changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and/or goodwill impairment for each reporting unit. we allocate goodwill to reporting units based on the reporting unit expected to benefit from the combination. we evaluate our reporting units on an annual basis and, if necessary, reassign goodwill using a relative fair value allocation approach.  we account for research and development costs in accordance with applicable accounting pronouncements, including sfas no.\u00a02, accounting for research and development costs, and sfas no.\u00a086, accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold, leased, or otherwise marketed. sfas no.\u00a086 specifies that costs incurred internally in researching and developing a computer software product should be charged to expense until technological feasibility has been established for the product. once technological feasibility is established, all software costs should be capitalized until the product is available for general release to customers. judgment is required in determining when technological feasibility of a product is established. we have determined that technological feasibility for our software products is reached after all high-risk development issues have been resolved through coding and testing. this is generally shortly before the products are released to manufacturing. we determined that technological feasibility was reached with windows vista and the 2007 microsoft office system during the second quarter of fiscal year 2007 and accordingly, we capitalized approximately $120 million of software development costs. the amortization of these costs will be included in cost of revenue over the estimated life of the products. previously, costs incurred prior to technological feasibility were not material and were expensed as incurred.  the outcomes of legal proceedings and claims brought against us are subject to significant uncertainty. sfas no.\u00a05, accounting for contingencies, requires that an estimated loss from a loss contingency such as a legal proceeding or claim should be accrued by a charge to income if it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. disclosure of a contingency is required if there is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss has been incurred. in determining whether a loss should be accrued we evaluate, among other factors, the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss. changes in these factors could materially impact our results of operations, financial position, or our cash flows.  sfas no.\u00a0109, accounting for income taxes, establishes financial accounting and reporting standards for the effect of income taxes. the objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entity\u0092s financial statements or tax returns. judgment is required in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns. variations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could materially impact our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. accruals for tax contingencies are provided for in accordance with the requirements of sfas no.\u00a05.  we account for stock-based compensation in accordance with sfas no.\u00a0123(r), share-based payment. under the fair value recognition provisions of this statement, share-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period. determining the fair value of share-based awards at the grant date requires judgment, including estimating expected dividends. in addition, judgment is also required in estimating the amount of share-based awards that are expected to be forfeited.   \u00a0 \u00a0  "

currency, interest rate, fixed-income, equity, and commodity price risks. a portion of these risks is hedged, but fluctuations could impact our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows. we hedge a portion of anticipated revenue and accounts receivable exposure to foreign currency fluctuations, primarily with option contracts. we monitor our foreign currency exposures daily to maximize the overall effectiveness of our foreign currency hedge positions. principal currencies hedged include the euro, japanese yen, british pound, and canadian dollar. fixed-income securities and interest rate derivatives are subject primarily to interest rate risk. the portfolio is diversified and structured to minimize credit risk. securities held in our equity and other investments portfolio and equity derivatives are subject to price risk, and are generally not hedged. however, we use put-call collars to hedge our price risk on certain equity securities that are held primarily for strategic purposes. commodity derivatives held for the purpose of portfolio diversification are subject to commodity price risk.  we use a value-at-risk (\u0093var\u0094) model to estimate and quantify our market risks. var is the expected loss, for a given confidence level, in fair value of our portfolio due to adverse market movements over a defined time horizon. the var model is not intended to represent actual losses in fair value, but is used as a risk estimation and management tool. the model used for currencies, equities, and commodities is geometric brownian motion, which allows incorporation of optionality with regard to these risk exposures. for interest rate risk, exposures such as key rate durations and spread durations are used in calculations that reflect the principle that fixed-income security prices revert to maturity value over time.  var is calculated by computing the exposures of each holding\u0092s market value to a range of over 1,000 equity, fixed-income, foreign exchange, and commodity risk factors. the exposures are then used to compute the parameters of a distribution of potential changes in the total market value of all holdings, taking into account the weighted historical volatilities of the different rates and prices and the weighted historical correlations among the different rates and prices. the var is then calculated as the total loss that will not be exceeded at the 97.5 percentile confidence level or, alternatively stated, the losses could exceed the var in 25 out of 1,000 cases. several risk factors are not captured in the model, including liquidity risk, operational risk, credit risk, and legal risk.  certain securities in our equity portfolio are held for strategic purposes. we hedge the value of a portion of these securities through the use of derivative contracts such as put-call collars. in these arrangements, we hedge a security\u0092s equity price risk below the purchased put strike and forgo most or all of the benefits of the security\u0092s appreciation above the sold call strike. we also hold equity securities for general investment return purposes. we have incurred material impairment charges related to these securities in previous periods.  the var amounts disclosed below are used as a risk management tool and reflect an estimate of potential reductions in fair value of our portfolio. losses in fair value over the specified holding period can exceed the reported var by significant amounts and can also accumulate over a longer time horizon than the specified holding period used in the var analysis. var amounts are not necessarily reflective of potential accounting losses, including determinations of other-than-temporary losses in fair value in accordance with u.s. gaap.  var numbers are shown separately for interest rate, currency rate, equity price, and commodity price risks. these var numbers include the underlying portfolio positions and related hedges. we use historical data to estimate var. given the reliance on historical data, var is most effective in estimating risk exposures in markets in which there are no fundamental changes or shifts in market conditions. an inherent limitation in var is that the distribution of past changes in market risk factors may not produce accurate predictions of future market risk.  the following table sets forth the one-day var for substantially all of our positions as of and for the years ended june\u00a030, 2007 and 2006:  \u00a0 total one-day var for the combined risk categories was $95 million at june\u00a030, 2007 and $158 million at june\u00a030, 2006. the total var is 39% less at june\u00a030, 2007, and 38% less at june\u00a030, 2006, than the sum of the separate risk categories in the above table due to the diversification benefit of the overall portfolio.  \u00a0 \u00a0   "

impairments). all other investments, excluding those accounted for using the equity method, are recorded at cost.  we lend certain fixed-income and equity securities to enhance investment income. the loaned securities continue to be carried as investments on our balance sheet. collateral and/or security interest is determined based upon the underlying security and the creditworthiness of the borrower. cash collateral is recorded as an asset with a corresponding liability.  investments are considered to be impaired when a decline in fair value is judged to be other-than-temporary. we employ a systematic methodology on a quarterly basis that considers available quantitative and qualitative evidence in evaluating potential impairment of our investments. if the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value, we evaluate, among other factors, general market conditions, the duration and extent to which the fair value is less than cost, and our intent and ability to hold the investment. we also consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of and business outlook for the investee, including industry and sector performance, changes in technology, operational and financing cash flow factors, and rating agency actions. once a decline in fair value is determined to be other-than-temporary, an impairment charge is recorded and a new cost basis in the investment is established.  we use derivative instruments to manage exposures to foreign currency, equity price, interest rate and credit risks, to enhance returns, and to facilitate portfolio diversification. our objectives for holding derivatives include reducing, eliminating, and efficiently managing the economic impact of these exposures as effectively as possible. derivative instruments are recognized as either assets or liabilities and are measured at fair value. the accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation. for a derivative instrument designated as a fair-value hedge, the gain or loss is recognized in earnings in the period of change together with the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item attributed to the risk being hedged. for a derivative instrument designated as a cash-flow hedge, the effective portion of the derivative\u0092s gain or loss is initially reported as a component of oci and is subsequently recognized in earnings when the hedged exposure affects earnings. the ineffective portion of the gain or loss is recognized in earnings. for options designated either as fair-value or cash-flow hedges, changes in the time value are excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and are recognized in earnings. gains and losses from changes in fair values of derivatives that are not designated as hedges for accounting purposes are recognized in earnings.  foreign currency risk.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0certain assets, liabilities, and forecasted transactions are exposed to foreign currency risk. we monitor our foreign currency exposures daily to maximize the overall effectiveness of our foreign currency hedge positions. options are used to hedge a portion of forecasted international revenue for up to three years in the future and are designated as cash-flow hedging instruments under statement of financial accounting standards (\u0093sfas\u0094) no.\u00a0133, accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities. principal currencies hedged include the euro, japanese yen, british pound, and canadian dollar. certain non-u.s. dollar denominated securities are hedged using foreign exchange forward contracts that are designated as fair-value hedging instruments under sfas no.\u00a0133. certain options and forwards not designated as hedging instruments under sfas no.\u00a0133 are also used to hedge the impact of the variability in exchange rates on accounts receivable and collections denominated in certain foreign currencies and to manage other foreign currency exposures.  equities price risk.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0equity investments are subject to market price risk. from time to time, we use and designate options to hedge fair values on certain equity securities. we determine the security, selected for hedging by evaluating market conditions, up-front costs, and other relevant factors. certain options, futures and swap contracts, not designated as hedging instruments under sfas no.\u00a0133, are also used to manage equity exposures.  interest rate risk.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0fixed-income securities are subject to interest rate risk. the fixed-income portfolio is diversified and consists primarily of investment grade securities to minimize credit risk. we use exchange-traded option and futures contracts and over-the-counter swap contracts, not designated as hedging instruments under sfas no.\u00a0133, to hedge interest rate risk.  other derivatives.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0swap contracts, not designated as hedging instruments under sfas no.\u00a0133, are used to manage exposures to credit risks, enhance returns, and to facilitate portfolio diversification. in addition, we may invest in warrants to purchase securities of other companies as a strategic investment. warrants that can be net share settled are deemed derivative financial instruments and are not designated as hedging instruments. \u0093to be   \u00a0 \u00a0  "

accounting for uncertainty in income taxes-an interpretation of fasb statement no.\u00a0109, which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise\u0092s financial statements in accordance with sfas no.\u00a0109, accounting for income taxes. the interpretation provides a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. under fin no.\u00a048, the company may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position should be measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. fin no.\u00a048 also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure, and transition. fin no.\u00a048 is effective for us beginning july\u00a01, 2007. based on our current assessment, the adoption of fin no.\u00a048 is expected to decrease beginning retained earnings by $200 million to $400 million upon adoption.  in june\u00a02006, the fasb ratified the emerging issues task force (\u0093eitf\u0094)\u00a0consensus on eitf issue no.\u00a006-2, \u0093accounting for sabbatical leave and other similar benefits pursuant to fasb statement no.\u00a043.\u0094 eitf issue no.\u00a006-2 requires companies to accrue the costs of compensated absences under a sabbatical or similar benefit arrangement over the requisite service period. eitf issue no.\u00a006-2 is effective for us beginning july\u00a01, 2007. the cumulative effect of the application of this consensus on prior period results should be recognized through a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the year of adoption. elective retrospective application is also permitted. we do not expect the application of this consensus to have a material impact on our financial statements.  in fiscal year 2007, we adopted staff accounting bulletin (\u0093sab\u0094) no.\u00a0108, considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying current year misstatements. sab no.\u00a0108 requires companies to quantify misstatements using both a balance sheet (iron curtain) and an income statement (rollover) approach to evaluate whether either approach results in an error that is material in light of relevant quantitative and qualitative factors, and provides for a one-time cumulative effect transition adjustment. the adoption of sab no.\u00a0108 did not have an impact on our financial statements.  in september 2006, the fasb issued sfas no.\u00a0157, fair value measurements, which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. sfas no.\u00a0157 does not require any new fair value measurements, but provides guidance on how to measure fair value by providing a fair value hierarchy used to classify the source of the information. this statement is effective for us beginning july\u00a01, 2008. we currently are assessing the potential impact that adoption of sfas no.\u00a0157 would have on our financial statements.  in february 2007, the fasb issued sfas no.\u00a0159, the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities. sfas no.\u00a0159 gives us the irrevocable option to carry many financial assets and liabilities at fair values, with changes in fair value recognized in earnings. sfas no.\u00a0159 is effective for us beginning july\u00a01, 2008, although early adoption is permitted. we are currently assessing the potential impact that adoption of sfas no.\u00a0159 will have on our financial statements.  note 2\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0unearned revenue  unearned revenue is comprised of the following items:  volume licensing programs \u0096 represents customer billings for multi-year licensing arrangements, paid either upfront or annually at the beginning of each billing coverage period, which are accounted for as subscriptions with revenue recognized ratably over the billing coverage period.  undelivered elements \u0096 represents free post-delivery telephone support and the right to receive unspecified upgrades/enhancements of microsoft internet explorer on a when-and-if-available basis. this revenue deferral is applicable for windows xp and previous pc operating systems shipped as retail packaged products, products licensed to original equipment manufacturers (\u0093oem\u0094), and perpetual licenses for current products under our open and select volume licensing programs. the amount recorded as unearned is based on the sales price of those elements when sold separately and is recognized ratably on a straight-line basis over the related product\u0092s life cycle. the percentage of revenue recorded as unearned due to undelivered elements ranges from approximately 15% to 25% of the sales price for windows xp home and approximately 5% to 15% of the sales price for windows xp   \u00a0 \u00a0  "

the options transferred to jpmorgan that expired without being exercised are not available for grant under any of our plans. we issue new shares to satisfy stock option exercises.  on november\u00a09, 2004, our shareholders approved amendments to the stock plans that allowed our board of directors to adjust eligible options, unvested stock awards, and shared performance stock awards to maintain their pre-dividend value after the $3.00 special dividend. additional awards were granted for options, stock awards, and shared performance stock awards by the ratio of post- and pre-special dividend stock price as of the ex-dividend date. strike prices for options were decreased by the same ratio. stock-based compensation was not affected by this adjustment. as a result of this approval and payment of the $3.00 special dividend on december\u00a02, 2004, an adjustment to the prices and number of shares of existing awards was made resulting in a total of 96\u00a0million options and 7\u00a0million stock awards being issued to adjust the outstanding awards. in addition, the target shared performance stock awards were increased by 4\u00a0million shares.  stock awards and shared performance stock awards.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0stock awards are grants that entitle the holder to shares of common stock as the award vests. our stock awards generally vest over a five-year period.  shared performance stock awards (\u0093spsas\u0094) are a form of stock award in which the number of shares ultimately received depends on our business performance against specified performance targets. the performance period for spsas issued in fiscal years 2004, 2005, and 2006 was july\u00a01, 2003 through june\u00a030, 2006 (january\u00a01, 2004 through june\u00a030, 2006 for certain executive officers). following the end of the performance period, the compensation committee of the board of directors determined that the number of shares of stock awards to be issued was 37.0\u00a0million, based on the actual performance against metrics established for the performance period. one-third of the awards vested in fiscal year 2007. an additional one-third of the awards will vest over each of the following two years. because the spsas covered a three-year period, spsas issued in fiscal year 2005 and 2006 were given only to newly hired and promoted employees eligible to receive spsas.  the company granted spsas for fiscal year 2007 with a performance period of july\u00a01, 2006 through june\u00a030, 2007. at the end of the performance period, the number of shares of stock subject to the award is determined by multiplying the target award by a percentage ranging from 0% to 150%. the percentage is determined based on performance against metrics for the performance period, as determined by the compensation committee of the board of directors in its sole discretion. an additional 15% of the total stock and stock awards will be available as   \u00a0 \u00a0  "

maximum amount of the potential fine as of june\u00a030, 2007 is $1.58\u00a0billion.\u00a0we have submitted a written response to the statement of objections and are seeking to determine a reasonable royalty rate with the commission.  in december 2005, the korean fair trade commission (\u0093kftc\u0094) ruled that we abused a market dominant position and engaged in unfair trade practices under the korean fair trade act. the kftc stated we violated the act by building instant messaging and media player features into the windows pc operating system and streaming media technologies into the windows server operating system. the kftc imposed a fine of approximately $34 million which we have expensed and paid. the kftc\u0092s order issued in february 2006 held that our integration of these media and messaging features into the windows pc and server operating systems was an abuse of monopoly power and unlawful tying in violation of the korean fair trade act. the order required us to develop and distribute in korea versions of windows xp and its successors that do not include windows media player or windows messenger functionality. we also may distribute a second modified version of windows that contains the media and messenger features, as long as it includes promotional links to certain competing media players and instant messengers. we have appealed the kftc\u0092s decision to the seoul high court. in may\u00a02006, the kftc denied our motion for reconsideration of its ruling, but also dropped the element of its ruling that prohibited us from including media player or instant messaging functionality in any product other than the windows client operating system for which we have a 50% or greater market share. in other ongoing investigations, various foreign governments and several state attorneys general have requested information from us concerning competition, privacy, and security issues.  antitrust, unfair competition, and overcharge class actions.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0a large number of antitrust and unfair competition class action lawsuits have been filed against us in various state and federal courts on behalf of various classes of direct and indirect purchasers of our pc operating system and certain other software products. we obtained dismissals of damages claims of indirect purchasers under federal law and in 15 states. courts refused to certify classes in two additional states. we have reached agreements to settle all claims in 20 states.  under the settlements, generally class members can obtain vouchers that entitle them to be reimbursed for purchases of a wide variety of platform-neutral computer hardware and software. the total value of vouchers that we may issue varies by state. we will make available to certain schools a percentage of those vouchers that are not issued or claimed (one-half to two-thirds depending on the state). the total value of vouchers we ultimately issue will depend on the number of class members who make claims and are issued vouchers. the maximum value of vouchers to be issued is approximately $2.7 billion. the actual costs of these settlements will be less than that maximum amount, depending on the number of class members and schools that are issued and redeem vouchers.  the settlements in all states but iowa have received final court approval. settlements in arkansas and wisconsin received final court approval in march 2007. the iowa case settled in february 2007 and the court gave its preliminary approval of the settlement in april 2007. the cases in mississippi have not been settled. we estimate the total cost to resolve all of these cases will range between $1.7 billion and $1.9 billion. the actual cost depends on factors such as the quantity and mix of products for which claims will be made, the number of eligible class members who ultimately use the vouchers, the nature of hardware and software that is acquired using the vouchers, and the cost of administering the claims. at june\u00a030, 2007, we have recorded a liability related to these claims of approximately $1.2 billion, which reflects our estimated exposure of $1.7 billion less payments made to date of approximately $500 million, mostly for administrative expenses and legal fees.  other antitrust litigation and claims.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0in november 2004, novell,

wordperfect and other productivity applications during the period between june 1994 and march 1996. in june\u00a02005, the trial court granted our motion to dismiss four of six claims of the
