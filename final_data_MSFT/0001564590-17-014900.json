margins for some new products and businesses will not be as high as the margins we have experienced historically.  we did extensive preparation and ongoing compatibility testing for applications and devices to help ensure a positive experience for our users installing windows 10. however, negative upgrade experiences could adversely affect the reception of windows\u00a010 in the marketplace and could lead to litigation or regulatory actions by customers and government agencies.\u00a0in addition, we anticipate that windows\u00a010 will enable new post-license monetization opportunities beyond initial license revenues.\u00a0our inability to realize these opportunities to the extent we expect could have an adverse impact on our revenues. finally, our practices for data collection, use, and management in windows 10 are subject to regulatory review, and may result in decisions directing us to change these practices and imposing fines. if so, we could face negative public reaction, degraded user experiences, and reduced flexibility in product design.  developing new technologies is complex. it can require long development and testing periods. significant delays in new releases or significant problems in creating new products or services could adversely affect our revenue.  acquisitions, joint ventures, and strategic alliances may have an adverse effect on our business.\u00a0we expect to continue making acquisitions and entering into joint ventures and strategic alliances as part of our long-term business strategy. in december 2016, we completed our acquisition of linkedin for $27.0 billion. the linkedin acquisition and other transactions and arrangements involve significant challenges and risks, including that they do not advance our business strategy, that we get an unsatisfactory return on our investment, that we have difficulty integrating and retaining new employees, business systems, and technology, or that they distract management from our other businesses. if an arrangement fails to adequately anticipate changing circumstances and interests of a party, it may result in early termination or renegotiation of the arrangement. the success of these transactions and arrangements will depend in part on our ability to leverage them to enhance our existing products and services or develop compelling new ones. it may take longer than expected to realize the full benefits from these transactions and arrangements, such as increased revenue, enhanced efficiencies, or increased market share, or the benefits may ultimately be smaller than we expected. these events could adversely affect our operating results or financial condition.  if our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets become impaired, we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings.\u00a0we acquire other companies and intangible assets and may not realize all the economic benefit from those acquisitions, which could cause an impairment of goodwill or intangibles. we review our amortizable intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. we test goodwill for impairment at least annually. factors that may be a change in circumstances, indicating that the carrying value of our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets may not be recoverable, include a decline in our stock price and market capitalization, reduced future cash flow estimates, and slower growth rates in industry segments in which we participate. we may be required to record a significant charge on our consolidated financial statements during the period in which any impairment of our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets is determined, negatively affecting our results of operations. for example, in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2015, we recorded a $5.1 billion charge for the impairment of goodwill and a $2.2 billion charge for the impairment of intangible assets, and in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016 we recorded a $480 million charge for the impairment of intangible assets. the impairment charges for both periods related to our phone business. our acquisition of linkedin resulted in a significant increase in our goodwill and intangible asset balances.  we may not earn the revenues we expect from our intellectual property rights.  we may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property rights  protecting our intellectual property rights and combating unlicensed copying and use of our software and other intellectual property on a global basis is difficult. while piracy adversely affects u.s. revenue, the impact on revenue from outside the u.s. is more significant, particularly in countries where laws are less protective of intellectual property rights. our revenue in these markets may grow slower than the underlying device market. similarly, the absence of harmonized patent laws makes it more difficult to ensure consistent respect for patent rights. throughout the world, we educate users about the benefits of licensing genuine products and obtaining indemnification benefits for intellectual property risks, and we educate lawmakers about the advantages of a business climate where intellectual property rights are protected. reductions in the legal protection for software intellectual property rights could adversely affect revenue.  19"

            "text": "part i item 1a \u00a0 we may not receive expected royalties from our patent licenses  we expend significant resources to patent the intellectual property we create with the expectation that we will generate revenues by incorporating that intellectual property in our products or services or, in some instances, by licensing our patents to others in return for a royalty.\u00a0changes in the law may weaken our ability to prevent the use of patented technology or collect revenue for licensing our patents.\u00a0these include legislative changes and regulatory actions that make it more difficult to obtain injunctions, and the increasing use of legal process to challenge issued patents. similarly, licensees of our patents may fail to satisfy their obligations to pay us royalties, or may contest the scope and extent of their obligations. finally, the royalties we can obtain to monetize our intellectual property may decline because of the evolution of technology, selling price changes in products using licensed patents, or the difficulty of discovering infringements. third parties may claim we infringe their intellectual property rights.\u00a0from time to time, others claim we infringe their intellectual property rights. the number of these claims may grow because of constant technological change in the markets in which we compete, the extensive patent coverage of existing technologies, the rapid rate of issuance of new patents, and our offering of first-party devices, such as surface and lumia phones. to resolve these claims, we may enter into royalty and licensing agreements on terms that are less favorable than currently available, stop selling or redesign affected products or services, or pay damages to satisfy indemnification commitments with our customers. these outcomes may cause operating margins to decline. besides money damages, in some jurisdictions plaintiffs can seek injunctive relief that may limit or prevent importing, marketing, and selling our products or services that have infringing technologies. in some countries, such as germany, an injunction can be issued before the parties have fully litigated the validity of the underlying patents. we have paid significant amounts to settle claims related to the use of technology and intellectual property rights and to procure intellectual property rights as part of our strategy to manage this risk, and may continue to do so.  we may not be able to protect our source code from copying if there is an unauthorized disclosure of source code.\u00a0source code, the detailed program commands for our operating systems and other software programs, is critical to our business. although we license portions of our application and operating system source code to several licensees, we take significant measures to protect the secrecy of large portions of our source code. if a significant portion of our source code leaks, we might lose future trade secret protection for that source code. it may become easier for third parties to compete with our products by copying functionality, which could adversely affect our revenue and operating margins. unauthorized disclosure of source code also could increase the security risks described in the next paragraph.  cyber-attacks and security vulnerabilities could lead to reduced revenue, increased costs, liability claims, or harm to our competitive position.  security of microsoft\u2019s information technology  threats to it security can take a variety of forms. individual and groups of hackers and sophisticated organizations, including state-sponsored organizations or nation-states, continuously undertake attacks that pose threats to our customers and our it.\u00a0these actors may use a wide variety of methods, which may include developing and deploying malicious software to attack our products and services and gain access to our networks and datacenters, using social engineering techniques to induce our employees, users, partners, or customers to disclose passwords or other sensitive information or take other actions to gain access to our data or our users\u2019 or customers\u2019 data, or acting in a coordinated manner to launch distributed denial of service or other coordinated attacks. cyber threats are constantly evolving, increasing the difficulty of detecting and successfully defending against them. cyber threats can have cascading impacts that unfold with increasing speed across our internal networks and systems and those of our partners and customers. breaches of our network or data security could disrupt the security of our internal systems and business applications, impair our ability to provide services to our customers and protect the privacy of their data, result in product development delays, compromise confidential or technical business information harming our reputation or competitive position, result in theft or misuse of our intellectual property or other assets, require us to allocate more resources to improved technologies, or otherwise adversely affect our business.  in addition, our internal it environment continues to evolve. often, we are early adopters of new devices and technologies. we embrace new ways of sharing data and communicating internally and with partners and customers using methods such as social networking and other consumer-oriented technologies. our business policies and internal security controls may not keep pace with these changes as new threats emerge.  20"

decisions to purchase or use our products or services. security threats are a challenge to companies like us whose business is technology products and services. threats to our own it infrastructure can also affect our customers. customers using our cloud-based services rely on the security of our infrastructure to ensure the reliability of our services and the protection of their data. hackers tend to focus their efforts on the most popular operating systems, programs, and services, including many of ours, and we expect that to continue. hackers that acquire user account information at other companies can use that information to compromise our users\u2019 accounts where accounts share the same attributes like passwords.  to defend against security threats, both to our internal it systems and those of our customers, we must continuously engineer more secure products and services, enhance security and reliability features, improve the deployment of software updates to address security vulnerabilities, develop mitigation technologies that help to secure customers from attacks even when software updates are not deployed, maintain the digital security infrastructure that protects the integrity of our network, products, and services, and provide customers security tools such as firewalls and anti-virus software.  the cost of these steps could reduce our operating margins. if we fail to do these things well, actual or perceived security vulnerabilities in our products and services could harm our reputation and lead customers to reduce or delay future purchases of products or subscriptions to services, or to use competing products or services. customers may also spend more on protecting their existing computer systems from attack, which could delay adoption of additional products or services. customers may fail to update their systems, continue to run software or operating systems we no longer support, or may fail timely to install security patches. any of these actions by customers could adversely affect our revenue. actual or perceived vulnerabilities may lead to claims against us. although our license agreements typically contain provisions that eliminate or limit our exposure to liability, there is no assurance these provisions will withstand legal challenges. legislative or regulatory action in these areas may increase the costs to develop, implement, or secure our products and services.  disclosure of personal data could result in liability and harm our reputation.\u00a0as we continue to grow the number and scale of our cloud-based offerings, we store and process increasingly large amounts of personally identifiable information of our customers. the continued occurrence of high-profile data breaches provides evidence of an external environment increasingly hostile to information security. despite our efforts to improve the security controls across our business groups and geographies, it is possible our security controls over personal data, our training of employees and vendors on data security, and other practices we follow may not prevent the improper disclosure of customer data we or our vendors store and manage. improper disclosure could harm our reputation, lead to legal exposure to customers, or subject us to liability under laws that protect personal data, resulting in increased costs or loss of revenue. our software products and services also enable our customers to store and process personal data on-premises or, increasingly, in a cloud-based environment we host. government authorities can sometimes require us to produce customer data in response to valid legal orders. in the u.s. and elsewhere, we advocate for transparency concerning these requests and appropriate limitations on government authority to compel disclosure. despite our efforts to protect customer data, perceptions that the collection, use, and retention of personal information is not satisfactorily protected could inhibit sales of our products or services, and could limit adoption of our cloud-based solutions by consumers, businesses, and government entities. additional security measures we may take to address customer concerns, or constraints on our flexibility to determine where and how to operate datacenters in response to customer expectations or governmental rules or actions, may cause higher operating expenses.  we may have outages, data losses, and disruptions of our online services if we fail to maintain an adequate operations infrastructure.\u00a0our increasing user traffic, growth in services, and the complexity of our products and services demand more computing power. we spend substantial amounts to build, purchase, or lease datacenters and equipment and to upgrade our technology and network infrastructure to handle more traffic on our websites and in our datacenters. these demands continue to increase as we introduce new products and services and support the growth of existing services such as bing, exchange online, microsoft azure, microsoft account services, office 365, onedrive, sharepoint online, skype, xbox live, outlook.com, and windows stores. we are rapidly growing our business of providing a platform and back-end hosting for services provided by third parties to their end users. maintaining, securing, and expanding this infrastructure is expensive and complex. it requires that we maintain an internet connectivity infrastructure that is robust and reliable within competitive and regulatory constraints that continue to evolve. inefficiencies or operational failures, including temporary or permanent loss of customer data or insufficient internet connectivity, could diminish the quality of our products, services, and user experience resulting in contractual liability, claims by customers and other third parties, regulatory actions, damage to our reputation, and loss of current and potential users, subscribers, and advertisers, each of which may harm our operating results and financial condition.  21"

and online content. for example, regulators may take the position that our offerings such as skype are covered by laws regulating telecommunications services. data protection authorities may assert that our collection, use, and management of customer data is inconsistent with their laws and regulations. applying these laws and regulations to our business is often unclear, subject to change over time, and sometimes may conflict from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. additionally, these laws and governments\u2019 approach to their enforcement, and our products and services, are continuing to evolve. compliance with these types of regulation may involve significant costs or require changes in products or business practices that result in reduced revenue. noncompliance could result in the imposition of penalties or orders we stop the alleged noncompliant activity.  laws and regulations relating to the handling of personal data may impede the adoption of our services or result in increased costs, legal claims, or fines against us.\u00a0the growth of our internet- and cloud-based services internationally relies increasingly on the movement of data across national boundaries. legal requirements relating to the collection, storage, handling, and transfer of personal data continue to evolve. for example, the eu and the u.s. formally entered into a new framework in july 2016 that provides a mechanism for companies to transfer data from eu member states to the u.s. this new framework, called the privacy shield, is intended to address shortcomings identified by the european court of justice in a predecessor mechanism. the privacy shield and other mechanisms are subject to review by the european courts, which may lead to uncertainty about the legal basis for data transfers across the atlantic. in 2016, the eu adopted a new law governing data practices and privacy called the general data protection regulation (\u201cgdpr\u201d), which becomes effective in may\u00a02018.\u00a0the law requires firms to meet new requirements regarding the handling of personal data. engineering efforts to build new capabilities to facilitate compliance with the law may entail substantial expense and the diversion of engineering resources from other projects. if we are unable to engineer products that meet microsoft\u2019s legal duties or help our customers meet their obligations under the gdpr or other data regulations, we might experience reduced demand for our offerings. non-compliance with the gdpr may result in monetary penalties of up to 4% of worldwide revenue. ongoing legal reviews by regulators may result in burdensome or inconsistent requirements affecting the location and movement of our customer and internal employee data as well as the management of that data. compliance may require changes in services, business practices, or internal systems that result in increased costs, lower revenue, reduced efficiency, or greater difficulty in competing with foreign-based firms. failure to comply with existing or new rules may result in significant penalties or orders to stop the alleged noncompliant activity.  our business depends on our ability to attract and retain talented employees.\u00a0our business is based on successfully attracting and retaining talented employees. the market for highly skilled workers and leaders in our industry is extremely competitive. we are limited in our ability to recruit internationally by restrictive domestic immigration laws. changes to u.s. immigration policies that restrain the flow of technical and professional talent may inhibit our ability to adequately staff our research and development efforts. if we are less successful in our recruiting efforts, or if we cannot retain key employees, our ability to develop and deliver successful products and services may be adversely affected. effective succession planning is also important to our long-term success. failure to ensure effective transfer of knowledge and smooth transitions involving key employees could hinder our strategic planning and execution. how employment-related laws are interpreted and applied to our workforce practices may result in increased operating costs and less flexibility in how we meet our workforce needs.  we have claims and lawsuits against us that may result in adverse outcomes.\u00a0we are subject to a variety of claims and lawsuits. these claims may arise from a wide variety of business practices and initiatives, including major new product releases such as windows 10, significant business transactions, warranty or product claims, and employment practices. adverse outcomes in some or all of these claims may result in significant monetary damages or injunctive relief that could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business. the litigation and other claims are subject to inherent uncertainties and management\u2019s view of these matters may change in the future. a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements could occur for the period in which the effect of an unfavorable outcome becomes probable and reasonably estimable.  we may have additional tax liabilities.\u00a0we are subject to income taxes in the u.s. and many foreign jurisdictions. significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes. in the ordinary course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. we regularly are under audit by tax authorities in different jurisdictions. economic\u00a0and political\u00a0pressures to increase tax revenue in various jurisdictions may make resolving tax disputes favorably more difficult. although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation in the jurisdictions where we are subject to taxation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals. the results of an audit or litigation could have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements in the period or periods in which that determination is made.  23"

corporations are taxed on foreign earnings. although we cannot predict whether or in what form any proposed legislation may pass, if enacted, it could have a material adverse impact on our tax expense and cash flows.  our hardware and software products may experience quality or supply problems.\u00a0our vertically-integrated hardware products such as xbox consoles, surface devices, and other devices we design, manufacture, and market are highly complex and can have defects in design, manufacture, or associated software. we could incur significant expenses, lost revenue, and reputational harm as a result of recalls, safety alerts, or product liability claims if we fail to prevent, detect, or address such issues through design, testing, or warranty repairs. we acquire some device components from sole suppliers. our competitors use some of the same suppliers and their demand for hardware components can affect the capacity available to us. if a component from a sole-source supplier is delayed or becomes unavailable, whether because of supplier capacity constraint or industry shortages, we may not obtain timely replacement supplies, resulting in reduced sales. component shortages, excess or obsolete inventory, or price reductions resulting in inventory adjustments may increase our cost of revenue. xbox consoles, surface devices, and other hardware are assembled in asia and other geographies that may be subject to disruptions in the supply chain, resulting in shortages that would affect our revenue and operating margins. these same risks would apply to any other vertically-integrated hardware and software products we may offer.  our software products also may experience quality or reliability problems. the highly-sophisticated software products we develop may contain bugs and other defects that interfere with their intended operation. any defects we do not detect and fix in pre-release testing could cause reduced sales and revenue, damage to our reputation, repair or remediation costs, delays in the release of new products or versions, or legal liability. although our license agreements typically contain provisions that eliminate or limit our exposure to liability, there is no assurance these provisions will withstand legal challenge.  we strive to empower all people and organizations to achieve more, and accessibility of our products is an important aspect of this goal. there is increasing pressure from advocacy groups, regulators, competitors, and customers to make technology more accessible. if our products do not meet customer expectations or emerging global accessibility requirements, we could lose sales opportunities or face regulatory actions.  our global business exposes us to operational and economic risks.\u00a0our customers are located in over 200 countries and a significant part of our revenue comes from international sales. the global nature of our business creates operational and economic risks. emerging markets are a significant focus of our international growth strategy. the developing nature of these markets presents several risks, including deterioration of social, political, labor, or economic conditions in a country or region, and difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations. although we hedge a portion of our international currency exposure, significant fluctuations in foreign exchange rates between the u.s. dollar and foreign currencies may adversely affect our revenue. competitive or regulatory pressure to make our pricing structure uniform might require that we reduce the sales price of our software in the u.s. and other countries.  catastrophic events or geopolitical conditions may disrupt our business.\u00a0a disruption or failure of our systems or operations because of a major earthquake, weather event, cyber-attack, terrorist attack, or other catastrophic event could cause delays in completing sales, providing services, or performing other critical functions. our corporate headquarters, a significant portion of our research and development activities, and certain other essential business operations are in the seattle, washington area, and we have other business operations in the silicon valley area of california, both of which are seismically active regions. a catastrophic event that results in the destruction or disruption of any of our critical business or it systems could harm our ability to conduct normal business operations. providing our customers with more services and solutions in the cloud puts a premium on the resilience of our systems and strength of our business continuity management plans, and magnifies the potential impact of prolonged service outages on our operating results.  24"

compared with $113.2 billion as of june\u00a030, 2016. equity and other investments were $6.0 billion as of june 30, 2017, compared with $10.4 billion as of june\u00a030, 2016. our short-term investments are primarily intended to facilitate liquidity and for capital preservation. they consist predominantly of highly liquid investment-grade fixed-income securities, diversified among industries and individual issuers. the investments are predominantly u.s. dollar-denominated securities, but also include foreign currency-denominated securities to diversify risk. our fixed-income investments are exposed to interest rate risk and credit risk. the credit risk and average maturity of our fixed-income portfolio are managed to achieve economic returns that correlate to certain fixed-income indices. the settlement risk related to these investments is insignificant given that the short-term investments held are primarily highly liquid investment-grade fixed-income securities.  of the cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments as of june 30, 2017, $127.9 billion was held by our foreign subsidiaries and would be subject to material repatriation tax effects. the amount of cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments held by foreign subsidiaries subject to other restrictions on the free flow of funds (primarily currency and other local regulatory) was $2.4 billion. as of june 30, 2017, approximately 87% of the cash equivalents and short-term investments held by our foreign subsidiaries were invested in u.s. government and agency securities, approximately 3% were invested in u.s. mortgage- and asset-backed securities, and approximately 2% were invested in corporate notes and bonds of u.s. companies, all of which are denominated in u.s. dollars. the remaining cash equivalents and short-term investments held by our foreign subsidiaries were primarily invested in foreign securities. securities lending  we lend certain fixed-income and equity securities to increase investment returns. the loaned securities continue to be carried as investments on our consolidated balance sheets. cash and/or security interests are received as collateral for the loaned securities with the amount determined based upon the underlying security lent and the creditworthiness of the borrower. cash collateral received is recorded as an asset with a corresponding liability. our securities lending payable balance was $97 million as of june 30, 2017. our average and maximum securities lending payable balances for fiscal year 2017 were $484 million and $1.5 billion, respectively. intra-year variances in the amount of securities loaned are mainly due to fluctuations in the demand for the securities.  valuation  in general, and where applicable, we use quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities to determine the fair value of our financial instruments. this pricing methodology applies to our level 1 investments, such as u.s. government securities, domestic and international equities, and exchange-traded mutual funds. if quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities are not available to determine fair value, then we use quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities or inputs other than the quoted prices that are observable either directly or indirectly. this pricing methodology applies to our level 2 investments such as foreign government bonds, corporate notes and bonds, mortgage- and asset-backed securities, u.s. government and agency securities, common and preferred stock, and certificates of deposit. level 3 investments are valued using internally developed models with unobservable inputs. assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis using unobservable inputs are an immaterial portion of our portfolio.  a majority of our investments are priced by pricing vendors and are generally level 1 or level 2 investments as these vendors either provide a quoted market price in an active market or use observable inputs for their pricing without applying significant adjustments. broker pricing is used mainly when a quoted price is not available, the investment is not priced by our pricing vendors, or when a broker price is more reflective of fair values in the market in which the investment trades. our broker-priced investments are generally classified as level 2 investments because the broker prices these investments based on similar assets without applying significant adjustments. in addition, all our broker-priced investments have a sufficient level of trading volume to demonstrate that the fair values used are appropriate for these investments. our fair value processes include controls that are designed to ensure appropriate fair values are recorded. these controls include model validation, review of key model inputs, analysis of period-over-period fluctuations, and independent recalculation of prices where appropriate.  40"

and recognized when the upgrade is delivered. if it is determined that implied post-contract customer support (\u201cpcs\u201d) is being provided, revenue from the arrangement is deferred and recognized over the implied pcs term. if updates are determined to not meet the definition of an upgrade, revenue is generally recognized as products are shipped or made available.  microsoft enters into arrangements that can include various combinations of software, services, and hardware. where elements are delivered over different periods of time, and when allowed under u.s. gaap, revenue is allocated to the respective elements based on their relative selling prices at the inception of the arrangement, and revenue is recognized as each element is delivered. we use a hierarchy to determine the fair value to be used for allocating revenue to elements: (i)\u00a0vendor-specific objective evidence of fair value (\u201cvsoe\u201d), (ii)\u00a0third-party evidence, and (iii)\u00a0best estimate of selling price (\u201cesp\u201d). for software elements, we follow the industry-specific software guidance which only allows for the use of vsoe in establishing fair value. generally, vsoe is the price charged when the deliverable is sold separately or the price established by management for a product that is not yet sold if it is probable that the price will not change before introduction into the marketplace. esps are established as best estimates of what the selling prices would be if the deliverables were sold regularly on a stand-alone basis. our process for determining esps requires judgment and considers multiple factors that may vary over time depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each deliverable.  customers purchasing a windows 10 license will receive unspecified updates and upgrades over the life of their windows 10 device at no additional cost. as these updates and upgrades will not be sold on a stand-alone basis, we are unable to establish vsoe. accordingly, revenue from licenses of windows 10 is recognized ratably over the estimated life of the related device, which ranges between two to four years.  the new standard related to revenue recognition will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. see note 1 \u2013 accounting policies in the notes to financial statements (part ii, item\u00a08 of this form 10-k) for further discussion.  impairment of investment securities  we review investments quarterly for indicators of other-than-temporary impairment. this determination requires significant judgment. in making this judgment, we employ a systematic methodology quarterly that considers available quantitative and qualitative evidence in evaluating potential impairment of our investments. if the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value, we evaluate, among other factors, general market conditions, credit quality of debt instrument issuers, the duration and extent to which the fair value is less than cost, and for equity securities, our intent and ability to hold, or plans to sell, the investment. for fixed-income securities, we also evaluate whether we have plans to sell the security or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery. we also consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of and business outlook for the investee, including industry and sector performance, changes in technology, and operational and financing cash flow factors. once a decline in fair value is determined to be other-than-temporary, an impairment charge is recorded to other income (expense), net and a new cost basis in the investment is established. if market, industry, and/or investee conditions deteriorate, we may incur future impairments.  goodwill  we allocate goodwill to reporting units based on the reporting unit expected to benefit from the business combination. we evaluate our reporting units on an annual basis and, if necessary, reassign goodwill using a relative fair value allocation approach. goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level (operating segment or one level below an operating segment) on an annual basis (may 1 for us) and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. these events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate, legal factors, operating performance indicators, competition, or sale or disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit.  application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment, including the identification of reporting units, assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units, assignment of goodwill to reporting units, and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit. the fair value of each reporting unit is estimated primarily through the use of a discounted cash flow methodology. this analysis requires significant judgments, including estimation of future cash flows, which is dependent on internal forecasts, estimation of the long-term rate of growth for our business, estimation of the useful life over which cash flows will occur, and determination of our weighted average cost of capital.  44"

            "text": "part ii item 8 \u00a0 revenue recognition for multiple-element arrangements requires judgment to determine if multiple elements exist, whether elements can be accounted for as separate units of accounting, and if so, the fair value for each of the elements.  microsoft enters into arrangements that can include various combinations of software, services, and hardware. where elements are delivered over different periods of time, and when allowed under u.s. gaap, revenue is allocated to the respective elements based on their relative selling prices at the inception of the arrangement, and revenue is recognized as each element is delivered. we use a hierarchy to determine the fair value to be used for allocating revenue to elements: (i) vendor-specific objective evidence of fair value (\u201cvsoe\u201d), (ii) third-party evidence, and (iii) best estimate of selling price (\u201cesp\u201d). for software elements, we follow the industry specific software guidance which only allows for the use of vsoe in establishing fair value. generally, vsoe is the price charged when the deliverable is sold separately or the price established by management for a product that is not yet sold if it is probable that the price will not change before introduction into the marketplace. esps are established as best estimates of what the selling prices would be if the deliverables were sold regularly on a stand-alone basis. our process for determining esps requires judgment and considers multiple factors that may vary over time depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each deliverable. revenue for retail packaged products, products licensed to original equipment manufacturers (\u201coems\u201d), and perpetual licenses under certain volume licensing programs generally is recognized as products are shipped or made available. technology guarantee programs are accounted for as multiple-element arrangements as customers receive free or significantly discounted rights to use upcoming new versions of a software product if they license existing versions of the product during the eligibility period. revenue is allocated between the existing product and the new product, and revenue allocated to the new product is deferred until that version is delivered. the revenue allocation is based on the vsoe of fair value of the products. the vsoe of fair value for upcoming new products are based on the price determined by management having the relevant authority when the element is not yet sold separately, but is expected to be sold in the near future at the price set by management.  software updates that will be provided free of charge are evaluated on a case-by-case basis to determine whether they meet the definition of an upgrade and create a multiple-element arrangement, which may require revenue to be deferred and recognized when the upgrade is delivered, or if it is determined that implied post-contract customer support (\u201cpcs\u201d) is being provided, the arrangement is accounted for as a multiple-element arrangement and all revenue from the arrangement is deferred and recognized over the implied pcs term when the vsoe of fair value does not exist. if updates are determined to not meet the definition of an upgrade, revenue is generally recognized as products are shipped or made available.  customers purchasing a windows 10 license will receive unspecified updates and upgrades over the life of their windows 10 device at no additional cost. as these updates and upgrades will not be sold on a stand-alone basis, we are unable to establish vsoe of fair value. accordingly, revenue from licenses of windows 10 is recognized ratably over the estimated life of the related device, which ranges between two to four years. certain volume licensing arrangements include a perpetual license for current products combined with rights to receive unspecified future versions of software products, which we have determined are additional software products and are therefore accounted for as subscriptions, with billings recorded as unearned revenue and recognized as revenue ratably over the coverage period. arrangements that include term-based licenses for current products with the right to use unspecified future versions of the software during the coverage period, are also accounted for as subscriptions, with revenue recognized ratably over the coverage period. revenue from cloud-based services arrangements that allow for the use of a hosted software product or service over a contractually determined period of time without taking possession of software are accounted for as subscriptions with billings recorded as unearned revenue and recognized as revenue ratably over the coverage period beginning on the date the service is made available to customers. revenue from cloud-based services arrangements that are provided on a consumption basis (for example, the amount of storage used in a particular period) is recognized commensurate with the customer utilization of such resources.  some volume licensing arrangements include time-based subscriptions for cloud-based services and software offerings that are accounted for as subscriptions. these arrangements are considered multiple-element arrangements. however, because all elements are accounted for as subscriptions and have the same coverage period and delivery pattern, they have the same revenue recognition timing.  55"

(\u201cipcom\u201d) is a german company that holds a large portfolio of mobile technology-related patents spanning about 170 patent families and addressing a broad range of cellular technologies. ipcom has asserted 19 of these patents in litigation against nokia corporation (\u201cnokia\u201d) and many of the leading cell phone companies and operators. in november 2014, microsoft and ipcom entered into a standstill agreement staying all of the pending litigation against microsoft to permit the parties to pursue settlement discussions, which continue.  interdigital patent litigation  interdigital technology corporation and interdigital communications corporation (collectively, \u201cidt\u201d) filed four patent infringement cases against nokia in the international trade commission (\u201citc\u201d) and in u.s. district court for the district of delaware between 2007 and 2013. we were added to these cases as a defendant after we acquired the nokia phone business. each of the itc matters was resolved in our favor. in september 2015, in an inter partes review the united states patent trial and appeal board issued a final written decision that deemed unpatentable all asserted claims of the patent remaining at issue in the delaware case. idt\u2019s appeal of this decision was heard by the u.s. court of appeals for the federal circuit on april 7, 2017 and the delaware case was stayed pending final completion of the inter partes review (including appeals and any subsequent proceedings in the patent office). we filed an antitrust complaint against idt in the district of delaware in august 2015 asserting violations of section\u00a02 of the sherman act, alleging unlawful exploitation of standard essential patents. microsoft and idt settled these cases in may 2017 and they have been dismissed.  european copyright levies  we assumed from nokia all potential liability due to nokia\u2019s alleged failure to pay \u201cprivate copyright levies\u201d in various european countries based upon sale of memory cards and mobile phones that incorporate blank memory.\u00a0the levies are based upon a 2001 european union (\u201ceu\u201d) directive establishing a right for end users to make copies of copyrighted works for personal or private use, but also allowing the collection of levies based upon sales of blank media or recording devices to compensate copyright holders for private copying.\u00a0various collecting societies in eu countries initiated litigation against nokia, stating it must pay levies not only based upon sales of blank memory cards, but also phones that include blank memory for data storage on the phones, regardless of actual usage of that memory.\u00a0the most significant cases against nokia were pending in germany and austria, due to both the high volume of sales and high levy amounts sought in these countries. we reached a settlement of the austrian case in august 2016. in germany, the only period for which settlement has not been reached is 2004 through 2007. in july 2016, the german supreme court heard our appeal contesting the legality of the levy assessed on phones with music players and over five megabytes of memory. the supreme court issued a ruling in december 2016, finding that the levy may not be appropriate for phones that have the ability to receive music files only via bluetooth or infrared inputs, and remanded for further proceedings. a new case schedule has not been set, and we have reached a tentative settlement.\u00a0\u00a0 other patent and intellectual property claims  in addition to the ipcom cases, there were 41 other patent infringement cases pending against microsoft as of june 30, 2017.  antitrust, unfair competition, and overcharge class actions  antitrust and unfair competition class action lawsuits were filed against us in british columbia, ontario, and quebec, canada. all three have been certified on behalf of canadian indirect purchasers who acquired licenses for microsoft operating system software and/or productivity application software between 1998 and 2010.  the trial of the british columbia action commenced in may 2016. the plaintiffs filed their case in chief in august 2016, setting out claims made, authorities, and evidence in support of their claims.\u00a0a six-month oral hearing is scheduled to commence in september 2017, consisting of cross examination on witness affidavits. the ontario and quebec cases are inactive.  84"

            "text": "part ii item 8 \u00a0 other antitrust litigation and claims  china state administration for industry and commerce investigation  in 2014, microsoft was informed that china\u2019s state administration for industry and commerce (\u201csaic\u201d) had begun a formal investigation relating to china\u2019s anti-monopoly law, and the saic conducted onsite inspections of microsoft offices in beijing, shanghai, guangzhou, and chengdu.\u00a0saic has stated the investigation relates to compatibility, bundle sales, file verification issues related to windows and office software, and potentially other issues.  product-related litigation  u.s. cell phone litigation  nokia, along with other handset manufacturers and network operators, is a defendant in 19 lawsuits filed in the superior court for the district of columbia by individual plaintiffs who allege that radio emissions from cellular handsets caused their brain tumors and other adverse health effects. we assumed responsibility for these claims as part of our acquisition of nokia\u2019s devices and services business and have been substituted for the nokia defendants. nine of these cases were filed in 2002 and are consolidated for certain pre-trial proceedings; the remaining 10 cases are stayed. in a separate 2009 decision, the court of appeals for the district of columbia held that adverse health effect claims arising from the use of cellular handsets that operate within the u.s. federal communications commission radio frequency emission guidelines (\u201cfcc guidelines\u201d) are pre-empted by federal law. the plaintiffs allege that their handsets either operated outside the fcc guidelines or were manufactured before the fcc guidelines went into effect. the lawsuits also allege an industry-wide conspiracy to manipulate the science and testing around emission guidelines.  in 2013, defendants in the consolidated cases moved to exclude plaintiffs\u2019 expert evidence of general causation on the basis of flawed scientific methodologies. in 2014, the trial court granted in part and denied in part defendants\u2019 motion to exclude plaintiffs\u2019 general causation experts. the defendants filed an interlocutory appeal challenging the standard for evaluating expert scientific evidence, which the district of columbia court of appeals heard en banc. in october 2016, the court of appeals issued its decision adopting the standard advocated by defendants and remanding the cases to the trial court for further proceedings under that standard. plaintiffs have filed a motion to reopen discovery and file additional expert evidence.  canadian cell phone class action  nokia, along with other handset manufacturers and network operators, is a defendant in a 2013 class action lawsuit filed in the supreme court of british columbia by a purported class of canadians who have used cellular phones for at least 1,600 hours, including a subclass of users with brain tumors. microsoft was served with the complaint in june 2014 and has been substituted for the nokia defendants. the litigation has been dormant for more than two years.  other contingencies  we also are subject to a variety of other claims and suits that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of our business. although management currently believes that resolving claims against us, individually or in aggregate, will not have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements, these matters are subject to inherent uncertainties and management\u2019s view of these matters may change in the future.  as of june 30, 2017, we accrued aggregate legal liabilities of $352 million. while we intend to defend these matters vigorously, adverse outcomes that we estimate could reach approximately $1.0 billion in aggregate beyond recorded amounts are reasonably possible. were unfavorable final outcomes to occur, there exists the possibility of a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements for the period in which the effects become reasonably estimable.  85"
