includes the microsoft xbox video game system, pc games, the home products division (hpd), and tv platform products. microsoft xbox, released in fiscal 2002, is our next-generation video game console system that delivers high quality graphics and audio experiences. we offer several types of entertainment products, including classic software games, online games, simulations, and sport and strategy games. hpd includes microsoft\u0092s line of consumer hardware and software products, such as the encarta line of learning products and services, the picture it! consumer publishing and productivity line of products and services, the macintosh applications business, and the microsoft hardware products.  home and entertainment segment oversees development and business strategy for the microsoft xbox video game system, including hardware, third-party games development, games development published under the microsoft label, xbox and xbox live operations, marketing, research, and sales and support. the segment leads the development efforts of our hpd product lines. the segment also carries out all retail sales and marketing for microsoft office, the windows operating systems, xbox, games, and hpd products. the segment is responsible for the development, sales, and deployment of microsoft\u0092s tv platform products for the interactive television industry.  \u00a0 international operations  \u00a0 microsoft develops and sells products throughout the world. our three major geographic sales and marketing organizations are the americas region, the europe, middle east, and africa region, and the japan and asia-pacific region. pressure to globalize our pricing structure might require that we reduce the sales price of our software in the united states and other countries. a number of other factors could also have a negative effect on our business and results from operations outside of the united states, including changes in trade protection laws, policies and measures, and other regulatory requirements affecting trade and investment; unexpected changes in regulatory requirements for software; social, political, labor, or economic conditions in a specific country or region, including foreign exchange rates; difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations; and potential adverse foreign tax consequences. a portion of international revenue is hedged, thus offsetting a portion of the currency translation exposure.  \u00a0 equity method investments  \u00a0 we have entered into joint venture arrangements to take advantage of creative talent and content from other organizations. for example, we own 50 percent of msnbc cable l.l.c., a 24-hour cable news and information channel, and 50 percent of msnbc interactive news l.l.c., an interactive online news service. national broadcasting company (nbc) owns the remaining 50 percent of each of these joint ventures.  \u00a0 product development  \u00a0 during fiscal years 2001, 2002, and 2003, research and development expense was $4.38 billion, $4.31 billion, and $4.66 billion, respectively. those amounts represented 17.3%, 15.2%, and 14.5%, respectively, of revenue in each of those years. during fiscal year 2001, $272 million of goodwill amortization was included in research and development expense. no goodwill amortization is included in fiscal years 2002 and 2003, in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards (sfas) 142, goodwill and other intangible assets. we plan to continue spending significant amounts for research and product development.  most of our software products are developed internally. we also purchase technology, license intellectual property rights, and oversee third-party development and localization of certain products. we do not believe we are materially dependent upon licenses and other agreements with third parties relating to the development of our products. internal development allows us to maintain closer technical control over our products and gives us the freedom to designate which modifications and enhancements are most important and when they should be implemented. we work to devise innovative solutions in computer science, such as making computers easier to use, designing software for the next generation of hardware, improving the software design process, and investigating the mathematical underpinnings of computer science. we have created a substantial body of development tools and have evolved development methodologies for creating and enhancing our products. these tools and methodologies are also designed to simplify a product\u0092s portability among different operating systems, microprocessors, and computing devices. product documentation is generally created internally. we strive to obtain information at the earliest possible time about changing usage patterns and hardware advances that may affect software design. before releasing new software platforms, we provide to application vendors a range of resources and guidelines for development, training, and testing.  microsoft .net is our strategy and implementation of connecting people, information, systems and devices through the use of web services. it includes everything needed to develop and deploy a web service-connected it architecture: servers to host web services (windows server system and windows server 2003), development tools to create them (microsoft visual studio .net 2003 and the .net framework), applications and smart devices that use them (microsoft office system, smart phones, pocket pcs and pcs), and a worldwide network of more than 35,000 microsoft certified partner organizations \u0096 people whose skills and experience can help businesses get the most from their it investments. built on industry standards, web services enable applications to communicate and share data over the internet or an intranet, regardless of operating system or programming language.  we believe that establishing trust in computing will be critical to our future success. trustworthy computing means helping ensure a safe and reliable computing experience that is both expected and taken for granted. achieving trustworthy computing will require the collaboration of hardware and software companies, academic and government research institutions, and policy leaders. for us, trustworthy computing is a company-wide initiative aimed at changing how we do business that will take fundamental research and advances in engineering, as well as changes to business culture and business processes to accomplish. we think there are four factors that affect the level of trust that people place in computing: security, privacy, reliability, and business integrity. security means the customer can expect that systems are resilient to attack, and that the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the system and its data are protected. privacy means the customer is able to control personal information and feel confident it is not only safe and used appropriately, but in a way that provides value. a reliable system or   \u00a0  "}, "4": {"tables": {}, "text": "table of contents \u00a0 part i, item 1\u00a0  \u00a0  service is one the customer can depend on to fulfill its functions. business integrity involves being responsive to customers, addressing problems effectively with products or services, and being transparent and responsive in customer interactions.  to serve the needs of users around the world, we \u0093localize\u0094 many of our products to reflect local languages and conventions and to improve the quality and usability of the product in international markets. localizing a product may require modifying the user interface, altering dialog boxes, and translating text.  \u00a0 manufacturing  \u00a0 we contract out most of our manufacturing activities to third parties. outside manufacturers produce the xbox, various retail software packaged products, and hardware. our products may include some components that are available from only one or from limited sources. key components that are currently obtained from a single source include the xbox central processing unit (cpu) from intel corporation and the xbox graphics processing unit (gpu) from nvidia corporation. with the exception of the xbox cpu and gpu, we generally have the ability to use other custom manufacturers if the current manufacturing vendor becomes unavailable. we generally have multiple sources for raw materials, supplies, and components and are often able to acquire component parts and materials on a volume discount basis.  \u00a0 operations  \u00a0 we have regional operations centers in ireland, singapore, and the greater seattle area. the centers support all operations in their regions, including information processing and vendor management and logistics. the regional center in dublin, ireland supports the europe, middle east, and africa region, the center in singapore supports the japan and asia-pacific region, and the center in the greater seattle area supports north and south america. microsoft licensing, inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary in reno, nevada, manages our original equipment manufacturer (oem) and certain organizational licensing operations.  \u00a0 distribution, sales and marketing  \u00a0 we distribute our products primarily through the following channels: oem; distributors and resellers; and online services and products. our three major geographic sales and marketing organizations are the americas region; the europe, middle east, and africa region; and the japan and asia-pacific region.  \u00a0 oem  \u00a0 microsoft operating systems are licensed primarily to oems under agreements that grant the oems the right to distribute copies of our products with their computing devices, principally pcs. we also market and license certain server operating systems, desktop applications, hardware devices, and consumer software products to oems under similar arrangements. we have oem agreements covering one or more of our products with virtually all of the major pc oems, including acer, actebis, dell, emachines, fujitsu, fujitsu gateway, hp, ibm, nec, samsung, siemens computers, sony, and toshiba. a substantial amount of oem business is also conducted with system builders, which are low-volume customized pc vendors.  \u00a0 distributors and resellers  \u00a0 we distribute our finished goods products primarily through independent non-exclusive distributors, authorized replicators, resellers and retail outlets. organizations license our products primarily through large account resellers (lars), direct market resellers (dmrs), and value added resellers. many organizations that license products through enterprise agreements (eas) now transact directly with us with sales support from our enterprise software advisor channel partners. these enterprise software advisors are also typically authorized as lars and operate as resellers for our other licensing programs. although all of our types of reselling partners reach organizations of all sizes, lars are primarily engaged with large organizations and value added resellers typically reach the breadth of small and medium sized organizations. some of our distributors include ingram micro and tech data, and some of our largest resellers include software spectrum, software house international, dell, cdw, and insight enterprises. individual consumers obtain our products primarily through retail outlets including best buy, wal-mart, and target. we have a network of field sales representatives and field support personnel who solicit orders from distributors and resellers and provide product training and sales support.  we license software to organizations under arrangements that allow the end-user customer to acquire multiple licenses of product. these arrangements are designed to provide organizations with a means of acquiring multiple licenses, without having to acquire separate packaged product through retail channels. in delivering organizational licensing arrangements to the market, we use different programs designed to provide flexibility for organizations of various sizes. while these programs may differ in various parts of the world, generally they are as follows:  \u00a0 open.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0targeted at small to medium organizations, this program allows customers to acquire perpetual licenses and, at the customer\u0092s election, rights to future versions of software products, over a specified time period (generally two years). the offering that conveys rights to future versions of software product is called software assurance. software assurance also provides support, tools, and training to help customers deploy and use software efficiently. under the open program, customers can acquire licenses only or licenses with software assurance. they can also renew software assurance upon the expiration of existing volume licensing agreements.  \u00a0 select.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0targeted at medium to large organizations, this program allows customers to acquire perpetual licenses and, at the customer\u0092s election, software assurance, which consists of rights to future versions of software products, support, tools, and training, over a specified time period (generally three years). similar to the open program, customers can acquire licenses only, acquire licenses with software assurance, or renew software assurance upon the expiration of existing volume licensing agreements.  \u00a0 enterprise agreement.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0the enterprise agreement is targeted at large organizations that want to acquire perpetual licenses to software products for their entire enterprise along with rights to future versions of software products over a three year period.   \u00a0  "}, "5": {"tables": {}, "text": "table of contents \u00a0 part i, item 1\u00a0  \u00a0 enterprise subscription agreement.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0the enterprise subscription agreement (esa) is a time-based, multi-year licensing arrangement. under an esa, customers acquire the right to use the current version of software products and the future versions that are released during the three year term of the arrangement. at the end of the arrangement term, customers may either renew their esa arrangement or exercise a buy-out option to obtain perpetual licenses for the latest version of the covered products. if they do not elect one of these options, then all covered software must be uninstalled.  \u00a0 online services and products  \u00a0 we distribute online content and services through msn subscription services, msn network services, bcentral small business portal, and other online services. msn subscription services deliver internet access and other premium services and tools to consumers. msn network services deliver online email and messaging communication services as well as information services such as online search and premium content. the bcentral portal provides tools and expertise for small business owners to build, market and manage their businesses online. other services delivered online include microsoft developer networks (msdn) subscription content and updates, periodic product updates, and online technical and practice readiness resources to support our partners in developing and selling microsoft products and solutions.  \u00a0 customers  \u00a0 our customers include individual consumers, small- and medium-size organizations, enterprises, governmental institutions, educational institutions, internet service providers, application developers, and oems. consumers and small- and medium-size organizations obtain microsoft products primarily through resellers and oems. no single customer accounted for 10% or more of revenue in 2001, 2002, or 2003. our practice is to ship our products promptly upon receipt of purchase orders from customers; consequently, backlog is not significant.  \u00a0 competition  \u00a0 the software business is intensely competitive and subject to rapid technological change, evolving customer requirements, and changing business models. we face significant competition in all areas of our current business activities. the rapid pace of technological change continually creates new opportunities for existing competitors and start-ups and can quickly render existing technologies less valuable. customer requirements and preferences continually change as other information technologies emerge or become less expensive, and as emerging concerns such as security and privacy become of paramount concern. we face direct competition with firms adopting alternative business models to the commercial software model. firms adopting the open source model typically provide customers with open source software at nominal cost and earn revenue on complimentary services and products, without having to bear the full costs of research and development for the open source software. additionally, global software piracy \u0096 the unlawful copying and distribution of our copyrighted software products \u0096 deprives us of large amounts of revenue on an annual basis. further, the existing versions of our products licensed to our installed base of users compete with future versions. this means that future versions must deliver significant additional value in order to induce existing customers to purchase a new version of our product.  our competitive position may be adversely affected in the future by one or more of the factors described in this section.  \u00a0 client  \u00a0 although we are the leader in operating system software products, we face strong competition from well established companies and entities with differing approaches to the market. competing commercial software products, including variants of unix, are supplied by competitors, such as ibm, hewlett-packard, apple computer, sun microsystems and others, who are vertically integrated in both software development and hardware manufacturing and have developed operating systems that they preinstall on their own computers. personal computer oems who preinstall third party operating systems may also license these firms\u0092 operating systems or open source software, especially offerings based on linux. variants of unix run on a wide variety of computer platforms and have gained increasing acceptance as desktop operating systems, in part due to the increasing performance of standard hardware components at decreasing prices. the linux open source operating system, which is also derived from unix and is available without payment under a general public license, has gained increasing acceptance as its feature set increasingly resembles the distinct and innovative features of windows and as competitive pressures on personal computer oems to reduce costs continue to increase. the microsoft windows operating systems also face competition from alternative platforms such as those based on internet browsing software and java technology promoted by sun microsystems, as well as innovative form factors that may reduce consumer demand for traditional personal computers. we believe our operating system products compete effectively by delivering better innovation, overall value, an easy-to-use interface, compatibility with a broad range of hardware and software applications, and the largest support network for any operating system.  \u00a0 server and tools  \u00a0 our server operating system products face intense competition from a wide variety of competing server operating systems and server applications offered by firms with a variety of market approaches. several vertically integrated computer manufacturers, such as ibm, hewlett-packard, apple computer, sun microsystems and others offer their own variant of unix preinstalled on server hardware, and virtually all computer manufacturers offer server hardware for the linux operating system. ibm\u0092s endorsement of linux has accelerated its acceptance as an alternative to both traditional unix and windows server operating systems. linux\u0092s competitive position has also benefited from the large number of compatible applications now produced by many leading commercial software developers as well as open source community developers. a number of companies supply versions of linux, including red hat and va linux.  we compete in the business of providing enterprise-wide computing solutions with several companies that provide competing solutions as well as middleware technology platforms. ibm and sun microsystems lead a group of companies focused on the java 2 platform enterprise edition (j2ee). commercial software developers that provide competing server applications for the pc-based   \u00a0  "}, "6": {"tables": {}, "text": "table of contents \u00a0 part i, item 1\u00a0  \u00a0  distributed client/server environments include oracle, ibm, computer associates, sybase, and informix. there are also a number of open source server applications available.  numerous commercial software vendors offer competing commercial software applications for connectivity (both internet and intranet), security, hosting, and e-business servers. additionally, ibm has a large installed base of lotus notes and cc:mail, both of which compete with our collaboration and email products. there are also a significant number of open source software products that compete with microsoft solutions, including apache web server.  the open source model of linux and other server programs enables both services and hardware companies to provide customers with open source software at nominal cost and earn revenue on complimentary services and products, without having to bear the full costs of research and development for the open source software. for example, ibm, with the largest hardware and services businesses in the industry, promotes linux extensively and seeks to earn revenues and profits on the sale of its consulting services to implement the linux server solution as well as related hardware and commercial software products that run on linux.  our developer products compete against offerings from bea systems, borland, ibm, macromedia, oracle, sun microsystems, sybase, and other companies.  we believe that our server products provide customers with significant advantages in innovation, performance (both relative to total costs of ownership and in absolute terms), productivity, applications development tools and environment, compatibility with a broad base of hardware and software applications, security, and manageability.  \u00a0 information worker  \u00a0 while we are the leader in business productivity software applications, competitors to the\u00a0microsoft office system include many software application vendors, such as apple, corel, ibm, oracle, qualcomm, sun microsystems, and local application developers in europe and asia. ibm and corel have significant installed bases with their spreadsheet and word processor products, respectively, and both have aggressive pricing strategies. also, apple and ibm preinstall certain of their application software products on various models of their pcs, competing directly with our applications. corel\u0092s suite and sun microsystems\u0092 star office are aggressively priced and attractive for oems to pre-install on low-priced pcs. the openoffice.org project provides a freely downloadable cross-platform application that is gaining popularity in certain market segments. in addition to traditional client-side applications, web-based applications hosting services such as simdesk provide an alternative to microsoft office and are gaining some support. we believe that our products compete effectively by providing customers significant benefits, such as easy-to-use personal productivity, support for effective teaming and collaboration, and better information management and control.  \u00a0 microsoft business solutions  \u00a0 the small and mid-market business applications market globally is highly fragmented and is intensely competitive in all sectors. we face competition from a large number of companies in this business. well-known vendors focused on small and mid-market business, such as intuit and sage, compete against us for a portion of this segment. in addition, large-enterprise focused vendors, such as oracle, peoplesoft and sap, also compete against us for a portion of this segment. however, the competition for a significant majority of the total business applications market includes thousands of much smaller vendors in specific localities or industries who offer their own enterprise resource planning, customer relationship management, and/or analytic solutions.  \u00a0 msn  \u00a0 msn competes with aol-time warner, google, yahoo!, and a vast array of web sites and portals that offer content of all types, such as email, instant messaging, calendaring, chat, search, and shopping services. as the broadband access market grows, we expect to have increasing opportunity to deliver premium subscription services for consumers. aol and yahoo! are both pursuing similar strategies and will be competitors in this emerging category. while the movement to broadband access may cause our internet access dial-up business to continue to decline, we will strive to convert customers to msn premium subscription services via partnerships with network providers and internet software services offered directly from msn. we believe our strengths are our heritage of technology innovation, particularly in communication services, distribution partnerships, and the large base of users of our free msn network. additionally, while our advertising business has grown considerably over the last year, evolving market conditions, particularly paid search, will impact our strategy over the next year. we currently are building our own search engine and investing to support the continued growth of our advertising business.  \u00a0 mobile and embedded devices  \u00a0 windows mobile software faces substantial competition from nokia, openwave systems, palmsource, qualcomm, and symbian. the embedded operating system market is highly fragmented with many competitive offerings. key competitors include ibm, wind river, and versions of embeddable linux from commercial linux vendors, such

fragmented, with competitive offerings from ibm and automotive suppliers building on various real-time operating system platforms from commercial linux vendors, qnx software systems, wind river, and others.  \u00a0 home and entertainment  \u00a0 the home and entertainment business is highly competitive and is characterized by limited platform life cycles, frequent introductions of new products and titles, and the development of new technologies. the markets for our products are characterized by significant price competition, and we anticipate continued pricing pressure from our competitors. these pressures have, from time to time, required us to reduce prices on certain products. our competitors vary in size from very small companies with limited resources to very large, diversified corporations with substantial financial and marketing resources. we compete primarily on the basis of price, product quality and variety, timing of product releases, and effectiveness of distribution and marketing.  \u00a0  "}, "7": {"tables": {}, "text": "table of contents \u00a0 part i, item 1, 2, 3, 4  \u00a0 our xbox hardware business competes with console platforms from nintendo and sony, both of which have a large established base of users. in addition to competing against software published for non-xbox platforms, our games business also competes with numerous companies that have been licensed by microsoft to develop and publish software for the xbox console. these competitors include acclaim entertainment, activision, atari, capcom, eidos, electronic arts, sega, take-two

was 10% in fiscal 2001, 12% in fiscal 2002, and 13% in fiscal 2003. revenue growth in fiscal 2003 was driven primarily by multi-year licensing that occurred before the transition to our new licensing program (licensing 6.0) in the first quarter of fiscal 2003. prior to the july 31, 2002 transition date to licensing 6.0, we experienced significant growth in multi-year licensing arrangements as customers enrolled in our maintenance programs, including upgrade advantage and software assurance. the revenue growth also reflected a $933 million or 13% increase associated with oem licensing of microsoft windows operating systems and a $309 million or 23% increase in revenue from microsoft xbox video game consoles. revenue growth in fiscal 2002 was led by the addition of $1.35 billion of xbox video game system revenue and $1.20 billion of revenue growth from microsoft windows xp professional and home operating systems. revenue growth in fiscal 2001 was driven primarily by licensing of microsoft windows 2000 professional with $1.01 billion growth in revenue from professional operating systems, and server and tools revenue growth of $852 million.  during the second quarter of fiscal 2002, we launched a new licensing program, licensing 6.0, for volume licensing customers. licensing 6.0 simplifies and improves our volume licensing program with software assurance, which gives customers the right to install any new release of products covered in the licensing agreement during the term of their coverage. the level of customer adoption of our new volume licensing programs will affect the mix of multi-year licensing agreements with a resulting impact on the timing of revenue recognition. in addition, the timing and extent of a recovery in consumer and corporate spending on pcs and information technology will be factors affecting revenue growth.  \u00a0 consolidated operating income  \u00a0 operating income grew 6% in fiscal 2001, 2% in fiscal 2002, and 11% in fiscal 2003. in fiscal 2003, the growth in operating income reflected an increase of $3.82 billion in revenue, partially offset by an increase of $2.52 billion in operating expenses, primarily related to employee and related costs associated with additional headcount and increased legal settlement expenses. in fiscal 2002, the growth in operating income reflected an increase of $3.07 billion in revenue, substantially offset by an increase of $2.88 billion in operating expenses, which included the onset of costs related to xbox video game systems. in fiscal 2001, the growth in operating

systems. in 2003, client revenue growth was driven by oem licensing revenue growth of $933 million and a 9 percentage point increase of the mix of the higher priced windows professional operating systems, the majority of which was in the oem channel. windows professional revenue growth for fiscal 2003 was $1.59 billion or 31% compared to fiscal 2002, partially offset by a $573 million decline

increased 11% primarily as a result of the 11% growth in revenue, partially offset by an increase in operating expenses, largely attributed to headcount additions and related costs.  in fiscal 2002, the growth in client revenue reflected strong multi-year licensing revenue growth and a continued shift of sales to the higher priced windows 2000 and windows xp professional operating system licensed through oems. oem revenue grew $939 million, despite a 5% decline in reported oem unit shipments. fiscal 2001 revenue growth reflected the strong adoption of windows 2000 professional with professional operating systems revenue growth of $1.01 billion and a 7 percentage point mix increase to the higher priced windows 2000 professional and windows nt workstation operating systems, and a $91 million increase in revenue from windows me and windows 98 operating systems.  we do not expect the revenue growth attributed to the mix toward the higher priced windows professional operating system to continue at previous levels into fiscal 2004. additionally, variability between the reported oem unit shipments and the underlying pc market may continue as a result of the transition to new oem licensing terms at the beginning of fiscal year 2003, under which oems are billed upon their acquisition of certificates of authenticity (coas) rather than upon the shipment of pcs to their

and client access licenses (cals) for windows server, sql server, exchange server, and other servers. it also includes developer tools, training, certification, microsoft press, premier product support services, and microsoft consulting services. total server and tools revenue grew $983 million or 16% in fiscal 2003, driven by an increase in windows-based server shipments and growth in sql server and exchange revenue. server revenue, including cals, grew $787 million or 18% from fiscal 2002 as a result of increased new and anniversary multi-year licensing agreements. consulting and premier product support services increased $91 million or 10% compared to fiscal 2002. revenue from developer tools, training, certification, microsoft press and other services increased $105 million or 13%. server operating profit for fiscal 2003 grew 20%, primarily as a result of the 16% increase in revenue.  in fiscal 2002, server and tools revenue increased 5% compared to fiscal 2001. server revenue, including cals, increased 9% versus fiscal 2001, driven by a 5% overall increase in windows-based server shipments and increased deployment of windows 2000 server. consulting and premier product support services revenue was up $137 million or 17% compared to fiscal 2001, while revenue from developer tools, training, certification, microsoft press and other services was down $183 million or 18% from fiscal 2001. in fiscal 2001, server and tools revenue increased $852 million or 17% versus the prior year, as a result of the continued adoption of the microsoft enterprise server offerings.  \u00a0 information worker  \u00a0 information worker revenue was $8.42 billion, $8.21 billion, and $9.23 billion in 2001, 2002, and 2003. information worker includes revenue from microsoft office, microsoft project, visio, other information worker products, sharepoint portal server cals, and professional product support services. the $1.02 billion or 12% increase in information worker revenue in fiscal year 2003 compared to fiscal 2002, was primarily due to growth in office suites revenue associated with new and anniversary multi-year licensing agreements and a $264 million or 28% increase in revenue from the combined total of project, visio, and other standalone applications. information worker operating profit for fiscal year 2003 grew 9% compared to fiscal year 2002 led by the 12% increase in revenue, partially offset by a 24% growth in operating expenses related to headcount additions and marketing expenses.  in fiscal 2002, information worker licensing revenue declined $228 million or 3% during the year due to a shift in the sales mix to multi-year licensing agreements, which deferred revenue recognition to future years, and a $294 million or 14% decrease in consumer purchases in the asia-pacific region, most notably japan, partially offset by a $189 million or 22% growth in oem licensing revenue. in fiscal 2001, information worker revenue growth was less than 1% or $30 million.  \u00a0 microsoft business solutions  \u00a0 microsoft business solutions revenue was $106 million, $308 million, and $567 million in 2001, 2002, and 2003. microsoft business solutions includes microsoft great plains, navision, and bcentral. microsoft business solutions revenue for fiscal 2003 grew $259\u00a0million from fiscal 2002, of which $246 million was attributable to the acquisition of navision at the beginning of the fiscal year. microsoft business solutions operating loss for fiscal 2003 increased 44%, primarily due to operating losses associated with navision, increases in sales and marketing expenses, research and development expenses, and acquisition related costs.  \u00a0 msn  \u00a0 msn revenue was $1.32 billion, $1.57 billion, and $1.95 billion in 2001, 2002, and 2003. msn includes msn subscriptions and msn network services. although total msn subscribers at the end of fiscal 2003 were flat compared to the end of fiscal 2002, msn subscriptions revenue grew $112 million or 11% in fiscal year 2003 reflecting an increase in the number of non-promotion subscribers. msn network services revenue grew $270 million or 48% in fiscal 2003 as a result of growth in paid search and strong general advertising sales across all geographic regions. msn operating loss for fiscal 2003 decreased 53%, primarily as a result of the growth in revenue and lower relative subscription acquisition and support costs.  in fiscal 2002, msn subscriptions revenue increased $229 million or 29% as a result of both a higher subscriber base and higher average revenue per subscriber due to a reduction in promotional subscriber programs. revenue from msn network services increased $27 million or 5% led by online advertising. in fiscal 2001, revenue from msn network services grew $197 million or 58% led by online advertising. msn subscriptions revenue also grew $141 million or 22% from fiscal 2000 as a result of an increased subscriber base, partially offset by a decline in the average revenue per subscriber due to a larger mix of subscribers contracted under rebate programs.  \u00a0  "}, "12": {"tables": {}, "text": "table of contents

shipments and mappoint licensing. operating loss for fiscal 2003 was flat with the prior year as higher marketing expenses and headcount-related costs associated with product development offset the

in fiscal 2003. operating loss for fiscal 2003 increased 6% from the prior year as the product costs associated with the increased xbox console sales and increased marketing expense more than offset the 12% increase in revenue.  in fiscal 2002, home and entertainment revenue growth from fiscal 2001 stemmed from $1.35 billion of sales of the xbox video game system released in fiscal 2002. learning and productivity software revenue and pc and online games declined $39 million or 3% in fiscal 2002 compared to fiscal 2001. in fiscal 2001, home and entertainment revenue declined $214 million or 16% from fiscal 2002.  \u00a0 other  \u00a0 revenue in the other segment represents our majority ownership of expedia, inc., which was sold in february 2002, resulting in a decline in revenue from fiscal 2001. acquisitions of travelscape.com and vacationspot.com by expedia, inc. in fiscal 2001 and increased product offerings from expedia led to the strong revenue growth in fiscal 2001.  operating loss includes expedia, inc. revenue and operating expenses, general and administrative expenses ($1.55 billion in 2002 and $2.10 billion in 2003), broad-based research and development expenses ($202 million in 2002 and $210 million in 2003), and certain corporate level sales and marketing costs ($526 million in 2002 and $688 million in 2003).  \u00a0 foreign currencies impact  \u00a0 our operating results are affected by foreign exchange rates. approximately 27%, 25%, and 28% of our revenue was collected in foreign currencies during 2001, 2002, and 2003. had the rates from fiscal 2002 been in effect in fiscal 2003, translated international revenue billed in local currencies would have been approximately $700 million lower. certain manufacturing, selling distribution and support costs are disbursed in local currencies, and a portion of international revenue is hedged, thus offsetting a portion of the translation exposure.  \u00a0 operating expenses  \u00a0 cost of revenue  \u00a0 cost of revenue includes manufacturing and distribution costs for products and programs sold, operation costs related to product support service centers and product distribution centers, costs incurred to support and maintain internet-based products and services, and costs associated with the delivery of consulting services. cost of revenue as a percent of revenue was 13.7% in 2001, 18.3% in 2002, and 17.7% in 2003. for fiscal 2003, cost of revenue was $5.69 billion compared to $5.19 billion in fiscal 2002. the primary driver of the decrease as a percentage of revenue in fiscal 2003 was a 0.2 percentage point decrease from home and entertainment products due to lower volumes and improved margins of xbox video game consoles and a 0.4 percentage point decrease from msn product and service costs in fiscal 2003 compared to fiscal 2002.  cost of revenue in fiscal 2002 was $5.19 billion compared to $3.46 billion in fiscal 2001. the increase as a percentage of revenue in fiscal 2002 was due to an increase of 5.3 percentage points from home and entertainment primarily due to costs related to xbox, partially offset by a 0.7 percentage point decrease due to a higher mix of revenue from licensing business. in fiscal 2001, cost of revenue was $3.46 billion, an increase of $453 million compared to fiscal 2000. the higher sales associated with msn subscription and msn network services resulting in increased support and service costs drove 0.4 of the 0.6 percentage point increase in total costs as a percentage of revenue.  \u00a0 research and development  \u00a0 research and development expenses include payroll, employee benefits, and other headcount-related costs associated with product development. research and development expenses also include third-party development and programming costs, localization costs incurred to translate software for international markets, and the amortization of purchased software code and services content. research and development expenses for fiscal 2003 were $4.66 billion, an increase of 8% compared to fiscal 2002. the increase reflects a 7% increase in headcount-related costs, a 25% increase in third-party product development costs, and a 29% increase in testing laboratory equipment and expense. in fiscal 2002, research and development expenses were $4.31 billion compared to $4.38 billion in fiscal 2001. the decrease from fiscal 2001 was due to the discontinuation of amortization of goodwill in accordance with sfas 142, goodwill and other intangible assets, $272 million which offset the 15% growth in headcount-related costs. in fiscal 2001, research and development expenses were $4.38 billion, an increase of 16% compared to fiscal 2000. the increase in research and development expenses resulted from a 11% increase in headcount-related costs and a 23% increase in investments in new product development.  \u00a0  "}, "13": {"tables": {"0": [["Year Ended June 30", "2001", "2002",

headcount-related costs associated with sales and marketing personnel and advertising, promotions, tradeshows, seminars, and other programs. sales and marketing expense as a percentage of revenue was 19.3% in 2001, 19.1% in 2002, and 20.3% in 2003. sales and marketing expenses were $6.52 billion in 2003, compared to $5.41 billion in fiscal 2002. the increase in absolute dollars was due to a 20% increase in sales expenses related to headcount additions, principally related to the enterprise and small/medium business sales forces, and a 21% increase in marketing expenses.  in fiscal 2002, sales and marketing expenses were $5.41 billion, an increase of 11% from fiscal 2001. the sales and marketing expenses in absolute dollars increased due to a 20% increase in headcount-related costs partially offset by a 25% decline in msn customer acquisition marketing costs and a 4% decline in all other marketing costs. in fiscal 2001, sales and marketing expenses were $4.89 billion compared to $4.13 billion in fiscal 2000. the 18% increase in sales and marketing from fiscal 2000 was primarily due to a 21% growth in headcount-related costs, and to a lesser extent, a 3% growth in higher marketing and sales expenses associated with msn and other new sales initiatives.  \u00a0 general and administrative  \u00a0 general and administrative costs include payroll, employee benefits, and other headcount-related costs associated with the finance, legal, facilities, certain human resources, other administrative headcount, and legal and other administrative fees. general and administrative costs in fiscal 2003 increased $554 million due to a charge of $750 million related to a settlement with aol/time warner in the fourth quarter of 2003 and also due to a $256 million charge reflecting an increase in our estimate of costs related to resolving pending state antitrust and unfair competition consumer class action lawsuits. general and administrative expenses in fiscal 2002 increased due to a charge of approximately $660 million for estimated expenses related to resolving pending state antitrust and unfair competition consumer class action lawsuits and a 10% increase in headcount-related costs. in fiscal 2001, general and administrative costs decreased due to a lawsuit settlement charge recorded in fiscal 2000, partially offset by a 3% growth in headcount-related costs.  \u00a0 non-operating items, investment income/(loss), and income taxes  \u00a0 non-operating items  \u00a0 losses on equity investees and other consist of our share of income or loss from investments accounted for using the equity method, and income or loss attributable to minority interests. the decrease in losses on equity investees and other in fiscal 2003 and 2002 was due to the divestiture of certain equity investments in fiscal 2002 in conjunction with the underlying performance of such entities. the increase in losses on equity investees and other in fiscal 2001 reflected an increase in the number of such investments during the year.  \u00a0 investment income/(loss)  \u00a0 we recorded net investment income/(loss) in each year as follows:  \u00a0 \u00a0 investments are considered to be impaired when a decline in fair value is judged to be other-than-temporary. we employ a systematic methodology that considers available evidence in evaluating potential impairment of our investments. if the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value, we evaluate, among other factors, general market conditions, the duration and extent to which the fair value is less than cost, as well as our intent and ability to hold the investment. we also consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of and business outlook for the investee, including industry and sector performance, changes in technology, operational and financing cash flow factors, and rating agency actions. once a decline in fair value is determined to be other-than-temporary, an impairment charge is recorded and a new cost basis in the investment is established.  in fiscal 2003, other-than-temporary impairments decreased mainly due to the lack of significant continued impairments in the cable and telecommunications sectors. interest income decreased $65 million due to declining interest rates partially offset by a larger investment portfolio. dividend income decreased $97 million primarily related to the exchange of at&t 5% convertible preferred debt for common shares of at&t corporation during the year.  in fiscal 2002, other-than-temporary impairments primarily related to our investment in at&t and other cable and telecommunication investments. net gains on the sales of investments included a $1.25 billion gain on sale of our share of expedia. interest and dividend income decreased $66 million from fiscal 2001 as a result of lower interest rates and dividend income.  in fiscal 2001, other-than-temporary impairments primarily related to cable and telecommunication investments. net gains from the sales of investments in fiscal 2001 included a gain from our investment in titus communications (which was merged with jupiter telecommunications) and the closing of the sale of transpoint to checkfree holdings corp. interest and dividend income increased $591 million from fiscal 2000, reflecting a larger investment portfolio.  \u00a0  "}, "14": {"tables": {}, "text": "table of contents \u00a0 part ii, item 7\u00a0  \u00a0 income taxes  \u00a0 our effective tax rate for fiscal 2003 was 32%, reflecting a one-time benefit in the second quarter of $126 million from the reversal of previously accrued taxes. the tax reversal stems from a 9th circuit court of appeals ruling in december 2002 overturning a previous tax court ruling that had denied tax benefits on certain revenue earned from the distribution of software to foreign customers. excluding this reversal, the effective tax rate would have been 33%. the effective tax rate for fiscal 2001 and fiscal 2002 was 33% and 32%, respectively.  \u00a0 accounting changes  \u00a0 effective july 1, 2001, we adopted sfas 141, business combinations, and sfas 142, goodwill and other intangible assets. sfas 141 requires business combinations to be accounted for using the purchase method of accounting. it also specifies the types of acquired intangible assets that are required to be recognized and reported separate from goodwill. sfas 142 requires that goodwill and certain intangibles no longer be amortized, but instead tested for impairment at least annually. there was no impairment of goodwill upon adoption of sfas 142. goodwill amortization (on a pre-tax basis) was $311 million in fiscal 2001.  effective july 1, 2000, we adopted sfas 133, accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities, which establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts and for hedging activities. the adoption of sfas 133 resulted in a cumulative pre-tax reduction to income of $560 million ($375 million after-tax) and a cumulative pre-tax reduction to other comprehensive income (oci) of $112 million ($75 million after-tax). the reduction to income was mostly attributable to a loss of approximately $300 million reclassified from oci for the time value of options and a loss of approximately $250 million reclassified from oci for derivatives not designated as hedging instruments. the reduction to oci was mostly attributable to losses of approximately $670 million on cash flow hedges offset by the reclassifications out of oci of the approximately $300 million loss for the time value of options and the approximately $250\u00a0million loss for derivative instruments not designated as hedging instruments.  \u00a0 stock-based compensation  \u00a0 on july 8, 2003, we announced changes in employee compensation designed to help us continue to attract and retain the best employees, and to better align employee interests with those of our shareholders. employees will be granted stock awards instead of stock options. the stock award program offers employees the opportunity to earn actual shares of our stock over time, rather than options that give employees the right to purchase stock at a set price. as part of the changes, we announced that a significant portion of stock-based compensation for more than 600 of our senior leaders will depend on growth in the number and satisfaction of our customers. we also indicated that we are working on a plan to enable employees to realize some value on the portion of their stock options that are currently out-of-the-money, by selling their options to a third-party financial institution. if approved, we expect to implement this plan by the end of 2003.  in addition to announcing changes to our employee compensation arrangements, we also indicated that we will adopt the fair value recognition provisions of sfas 123, accounting for stock-based compensation, effective july 1, 2003, and will report that change in accounting principle using the retroactive restatement method described in sfas 148, accounting for stock-based compensation-transition and disclosure. note 16 of the notes to the financial statements provides pro forma income statements for 2001, 2002, and 2003 as if compensation cost for our stock option and employee stock purchase plans had been determined as prescribed by sfas 123.  \u00a0 financial condition  \u00a0 our cash and short-term investment portfolio totaled $49.05 billion at june 30, 2003, an increase of $10.40 billion from fiscal year 2002. the portfolio consists primarily of fixed-income securities, diversified among industries and individual issuers. our investments are generally liquid and investment grade. the portfolio is invested predominantly in u.s. dollar denominated securities, but also includes foreign currency positions, in order to diversify financial risk. the portfolio is primarily invested in short-term securities to minimize interest rate risk and facilitate rapid deployment for immediate cash needs.  unearned revenue as of june 30, 2003 was $9.02 billion, increasing $1.27 billion from june 30, 2002, reflecting the addition of new and anniversary multi-year licensing agreements, partially offset by continued recognition of unearned revenue from multi-year licensing in prior periods.  cash flow from operations was $15.80 billion for fiscal 2003, an increase of $1.29 billion from fiscal 2002. the increase reflects a $2.16 billion increase in net income from fiscal year 2002 and an increase of $1.37 billion in unearned revenue, offset by an increase of $2.36 billion in recognition of unearned revenue. cash used for financing was $5.22 billion in fiscal 2003, an increase of $651 million from the prior year. the increase reflects a cash dividend payment of $857 million in 2003 and an increase of $417\u00a0million in common stock repurchase, offsetting $623 million received for common stock issued. we repurchased 238.2 million shares of common stock under our share repurchase program in fiscal 2003. cash used for investing was $7.21 billion in fiscal 2003, a decrease of $3.63 billion from fiscal 2002, due to stronger portfolio performance on sold and matured investments.  cash flow from operations was $14.51 billion for fiscal 2002, an increase of $1.09 billion from fiscal 2001. the increase reflected strong growth in unearned revenue as a result of the significant number of customers that purchased upgrade advantage during the licensing 6.0 transition period. this resulted in an increase in billings and a corresponding increase in the unearned revenue amount. cash used for financing was $4.57 billion in fiscal 2002, a decrease of $1.01 billion from the prior year. the decrease reflected the repurchase of put warrants in the prior year. we repurchased 245.6 million shares of common stock under our share repurchase program in fiscal 2002. in addition, 10.2 million shares of common stock were acquired in fiscal 2002 under a structured stock repurchase transaction. we entered into the structured stock repurchase transaction in fiscal 2001, which gave us the right to acquire 10.2 million of our shares in exchange for an up-front net payment of $264 million. cash used for investing was $10.85\u00a0billion in fiscal 2002, an increase of $2.11 billion from fiscal 2001.  \u00a0  "}, "15": {"tables": {}, "text": "table of contents \u00a0 part ii, item 7\u00a0  \u00a0 cash flow from operations was $13.42 billion in fiscal 2001, an increase of $2.00 billion from the prior year. the increase was primarily attributable to the growth in revenue and other changes in working capital, partially offset by a decrease in the stock option income tax benefit, reflecting decreased stock option exercises by employees. cash used for financing was $5.59 billion in fiscal 2001, an increase of $3.39 billion from the prior year. the increase primarily reflected the repurchase of put warrants in fiscal 2001, compared to the sale of put warrants in the prior fiscal year, as well as an increase in common stock repurchased. all outstanding put warrants were either retired or exercised during fiscal 2001. during fiscal 2001, we repurchased 178.1 million shares. cash used for investing was $8.73 billion in fiscal 2001, a decrease of $658 million from the prior year.  we have no material long-term debt. stockholders\u0092 equity at june 30, 2003 was $61.02 billion. we will continue to invest in sales, marketing, product support infrastructure, and existing and advanced areas of technology. additions to property and equipment will continue, including new facilities and computer systems for r&d, sales and marketing, support, and administrative staff. commitments for constructing new buildings were $117 million on june 30, 2003. we have not engaged in any related party transactions or arrangements with unconsolidated entities or other persons that are reasonably likely to materially affect liquidity or the availability of or requirements for capital resources.  we believe existing cash and short-term investments together with funds generated from operations should be sufficient to meet operating requirements. our philosophy regarding the maintenance of a balance sheet with a large component of cash and short-term investments, as well as equity and other investments, reflects our views on potential future capital requirements relating to research and development, creation and expansion of sales distribution channels, investments and acquisitions, share dilution management, legal risks, and challenges to our business model. we continuously assess our investment management approach in view of our current and potential future needs.  \u00a0 off-balance sheet arrangements  \u00a0 we have operating leases for most u.s. and international sales and support offices and certain equipment. rental expense for operating leases was $281 million, $318 million, and $290 million in 2001, 2002, and 2003, respectively. future minimum rental commitments under noncancellable leases, in millions of dollars, are: 2004, $218; 2005, $202; 2006, $172; 2007, $134; 2008, $116; and thereafter, $429.  we have unconditionally guaranteed the repayment of certain japanese yen denominated bank loans and related interest and fees of jupiter telecommunication, ltd., a japanese cable company (jupiter). these guarantees arose on february 1, 2003 in conjunction with the expiration of prior financing arrangements, including previous guarantees by us. the financing arrangements were entered into by jupiter as part of financing its operations. as part of jupiter\u0092s new financing agreement, we agreed to guarantee repayment by jupiter of the loans of approximately $51 million. the estimated fair value and the carrying value of the guarantees was $10.5 million and did not result in a charge to operations. the guarantees are in effect until the earlier of repayment of the loans, including accrued interest and fees, or february 1, 2009. the maximum amount of the guarantees is limited to the sum of the total due and unpaid principal amounts, accrued and unpaid interest, and any other related expenses. additionally, the maximum amount of the guarantees, denominated in japanese yen, will vary based on fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. if we were required to make payments under the guarantees, we may recover all or a portion of those payments upon liquidation of jupiter\u0092s assets. the proceeds from such liquidation cannot be accurately estimated due to the multitude of factors that would affect the valuation and realization of the proceeds in the event of liquidation.  in connection with various operating leases, we issued residual value guarantees, which provide that if we do not purchase the leased property from the lessor at the end of the lease term, then we are liable to the lessor for an amount equal to the shortage (if any) between the proceeds from the sale of the property and an agreed value. as of june 30, 2003, the maximum amount of the residual value guarantees was approximately $271 million. we believe that proceeds from the sale of properties under operating leases would exceed the payment obligation and therefore no liability to us currently exists.  we provide indemnifications of varying scope and size to certain customers against claims of intellectual property infringement made by third parties arising from the use of our products. we evaluate estimated losses for such indemnifications under sfas 5, accounting for contingencies, as interpreted by fin 45. we consider such factors as the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss. to date, we have not encountered material costs as a result of such obligations and have not accrued any liabilities related to such indemnifications in our financial statements.  \u00a0 recently issued accounting standards  \u00a0 in january 2003, the fasb issued interpretation 46, consolidation of variable interest entities. in general, a variable interest entity is a corporation, partnership, trust, or any other legal structure used for business purposes that either (a) does not have equity investors with voting rights or (b) has equity investors that do not provide sufficient financial resources for the entity to support its activities. interpretation 46 requires a variable interest entity to be consolidated by a company if that company is subject to a majority of the risk of loss from the variable interest entity\u0092s activities or entitled to receive a majority of the entity\u0092s residual returns or both. the consolidation requirements of interpretation 46 apply immediately to variable interest entities created after january 31, 2003. the consolidation requirements apply to transactions entered into prior to february 1, 2003 in the first fiscal year or interim period beginning after june 15, 2003. certain of the disclosure requirements apply in all financial statements issued after january 31, 2003, regardless of when the variable interest entity was established. the adoption of the interpretation on july\u00a01, 2003 did not have a material impact on our financial statements.  in april 2003, the fasb issued sfas 149, amendment of statement 133 on derivative instruments and hedging activities, which amends and clarifies accounting for derivative instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts, and for hedging activities under sfas 133. the statement is effective (with certain exceptions) for contracts entered into or modified after june 30, 2003. we do not believe the adoption of this statement will have a material impact on our financial statements.  in may 2003, the fasb issued sfas 150, accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity. the statement establishes standards for how an issuer classifies and measures certain financial instruments with   \u00a0  "}, "16": {"tables": {}, "text": "table of contents \u00a0 part ii, item 7\u00a0  \u00a0  characteristics of both liabilities and equity. it requires that an issuer classify a financial instrument that is within its scope as a liability (or an asset in some circumstances). it is effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after may 31, 2003, and otherwise is effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after june 15, 2003. while we do not believe the adoption of this statement will have a material impact on our financial statements, we continue to assess the impact this statement will have on certain of our share repurchase programs.  \u00a0 application of critical accounting policies  \u00a0 our financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with u.s. gaap. preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. these estimates and assumptions are affected by management\u0092s application of accounting policies. critical accounting policies for us include revenue recognition, impairment of investment securities, impairment of goodwill, accounting for research and development costs, accounting for legal contingencies, and accounting for income taxes.  we account for the licensing of software in accordance with american institute of certified public accountants (aicpa) statement of position (sop) 97-2, software revenue recognition. the application of sop 97-2 requires judgment, including whether a software arrangement includes multiple elements, and if so, whether vendor-specific objective evidence (vsoe) of fair value exists for those elements. end users receive certain elements of our products over a period of time. these elements include free post-delivery telephone support and the right to receive unspecified upgrades/enhancements of microsoft internet explorer on a when-and-if-available basis, the fair value of which is recognized over the product\u0092s estimated life cycle. changes to the elements in a software arrangement, the ability to identify vsoe for those elements, the fair value of the respective elements, and changes to a product\u0092s estimated life cycle could materially impact the amount of earned and unearned revenue. judgment is also required to assess whether future releases of certain software represent new products or upgrades and enhancements to existing products.  sfas 115, accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities, and securities and exchange commission (sec) staff accounting bulletin (sab) 59, accounting for noncurrent marketable equity securities, provide guidance on determining when an investment is other-than-temporarily impaired. this determination requires significant judgment. in making this judgment, we evaluate, among other factors, the duration and extent to which the fair value of an investment is less than its cost; the financial health of and near-term business outlook for the investee, including factors such as industry and sector performance, changes in technology, and operational and financing cash flow; and our intent and ability to hold the investment.  sfas 142, goodwill and other intangible assets, requires that goodwill be tested for impairment at the reporting unit level (operating segment or one level below an operating segment) on an annual basis (july 1st for microsoft) and between annual tests in certain circumstances. application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment, including the identification of reporting units, assigning assets and liabilities to reporting units, assigning goodwill to reporting units, and determining the fair value of each reporting unit. significant judgments required to estimate the fair value of reporting units include estimating future cash flows, determining appropriate discount rates and other assumptions. changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and/or goodwill impairment for each reporting unit.  we account for research and development costs in accordance with several accounting pronouncements, including sfas 2, accounting for research and development costs, and sfas 86, accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold, leased, or otherwise marketed. sfas 86 specifies that costs incurred internally in creating a computer software product should be charged to expense when incurred as research and development until technological feasibility has been established for the product. once technological feasibility is established, all software costs should be capitalized until the product is available for general release to customers. judgment is required in determining when technological feasibility of a product is established. we have determined that technological feasibility for our products is reached shortly before the products are released to manufacturing. costs incurred after technological feasibility is established are not material, and accordingly, we expense all research and development costs when incurred.  we are subject to various legal proceedings and claims, the outcomes of which are subject to significant uncertainty. sfas 5, accounting for contingencies, requires that an estimated loss from a loss contingency should be accrued by a charge to income if it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. disclosure of a contingency is required if there is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss has been incurred. we evaluate, among other factors, the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss. changes in these factors could materially impact our financial position or our results of operations.  sfas 109, accounting for income taxes, establishes financial accounting and reporting standards for the effect of income taxes. the objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entity\u0092s financial statements or tax returns. judgment is required in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns. fluctuations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could materially impact our financial position or our results of operations.  \u00a0 issues and uncertainties  \u00a0 this annual report on form 10-k contains statements that are forward-looking. these statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties. actual results could differ materially because of issues and uncertainties such as those listed below and elsewhere in this report, which, among others, should be considered in evaluating our financial outlook.  \u00a0 challenges to our business model  \u00a0 since our inception, our business model has been based upon customers agreeing to pay a fee to license software developed and distributed by us. under this commercial software model, software developers bear the costs of converting original ideas into software products through investments in research and development, offsetting these costs with the revenues received from the distribution of their products. we believe the commercial software model has had substantial benefits for users of software, allowing them to rely on our expertise and the expertise of other software developers that have powerful incentives to develop   \u00a0  "}, "17": {"tables": {}, "text": "table of contents \u00a0 part ii, item 7\u00a0  \u00a0  innovative software that is useful, reliable, and compatible with other software and hardware. in recent years, there has been a growing challenge to the commercial software model, often referred to as the open source model. under the open source model, software is produced by loosely associated groups of unpaid programmers, and the resulting software and the intellectual property contained therein is licensed to end users at substantially no cost. the most notable example of open source software is the linux operating system. while we believe that our products provide customers with significant advantages in security and productivity, and generally have a lower total cost of ownership than open source software, the popularization of the open source model continues to pose a significant challenge to our business model, including recent efforts by proponents of the open source model to convince governments worldwide to mandate the use of open source software in their purchase and deployment of software products. to the extent the open source model gains increasing market acceptance, sales of our products may decline, we may have to reduce the prices we charge for our products, and revenues and operating margins may consequently decline.  \u00a0 intellectual property rights  \u00a0 we defend our intellectual property rights, but unlicensed copying and use of software and intellectual property rights represents a loss of revenue to us. while this adversely affects u.s. revenue, the impact on revenue from outside the united states is more significant, particularly in countries where laws are less protective of intellectual property rights. throughout the world, we actively educate consumers about the benefits of licensing genuine products and educate lawmakers about the advantages of a business climate where intellectual property rights are protected. however, continued educational and enforcement efforts may not affect revenue positively and further deterioration in compliance with existing legal protections or reductions in the legal protection for intellectual property rights of software developers could adversely affect revenue.  from time to time we receive notices from others claiming we infringe their intellectual property rights. the number of these claims may grow. responding to these claims may require us to enter into royalty and licensing agreements on unfavorable terms, require us to stop selling or to redesign affected products, or to pay damages or to satisfy indemnification commitments with our customers.  we have made and expect to continue making significant expenditures to acquire the use of technology and intellectual property rights, including via cross-licenses of broad patent portfolios.  \u00a0 new products and services  \u00a0 we have made significant investments in research, development and marketing for new products, services and technologies, including microsoft .net, xbox, business applications, msn, mobile and wireless technologies, and television. significant revenue from new product and service investments may not be achieved for a number of years, if at all. moreover, these products and services may never be profitable, and even if they are profitable, operating margins for these businesses are not expected to be as high as the margins historically experienced by us.  \u00a0 litigation  \u00a0 as discussed in note 20 \u0096 contingencies of the notes to financial statements, we are subject to a variety of claims and lawsuits. while we believe that none of the litigation matters in which we are currently involved will have a material adverse impact on our financial position or results of operations, it is possible that one or more of these matters could be resolved in a manner that ultimately would have a material adverse impact on our business, and could negatively impact our revenues, operating margins, and net income.  \u00a0 declines in demand for software  \u00a0 if overall market demand for pcs, servers and other computing devices declines significantly, or consumer or corporate spending for such products declines, our revenue will be adversely affected. additionally, our revenues would be unfavorably impacted if customers reduce their purchases of new software products or upgrades to existing products because new product offerings are not perceived as adding significant new functionality or other value to prospective purchasers. a significant number of customers purchased license agreements providing upgrade rights to specific licensed products prior to the transition to licensing 6.0 in july 2002. these agreements will expire in 2004 and 2005 and the rate at which such customers renew these contracts could adversely affect future revenues. we are also committing significant investments in the next release of the windows operating system, codenamed longhorn. if this system is not perceived as offering significant new functionality or value to prospective purchasers, our revenues and operating margins could be adversely affected.  \u00a0 product development schedule  \u00a0 the development of software products is a complex and time-consuming process. new products and enhancements to existing products can require long development and testing periods. significant delays in new product releases or significant problems in creating new products, particularly any delays in the longhorn operating system, could adversely affect our revenues.  \u00a0 general economic and geo-political risks  \u00a0 continued softness in corporate information technology spending or other changes in general economic conditions that affect demand for computer hardware or software could adversely affect our revenues. terrorist activity and armed conflict pose the additional risk of general economic disruption and could require changes in our international operations and security arrangements, thus increasing our operating costs. these conditions lend additional uncertainty to the timing and budget for technology investment decisions by our customers.  \u00a0 competition  \u00a0 we continue to experience intensive competition across all markets for our products and services. these competitive pressures may result in decreased sales volumes, price reductions, and/or increased operating costs, such as for marketing and sales incentives, resulting in lower revenues, gross margins and operating income.  \u00a0 taxation of extraterritorial income  \u00a0 in august 2001, a world trade organization (\u0093wto\u0094) dispute panel determined that the tax provisions of the fsc repeal and extraterritorial income exclusion act of 2000 (\u0093eti\u0094) constitute an export subsidy prohibited by the wto agreement on subsidies   \u00a0  "}, "18": {"tables": {}, "text": "table of contents \u00a0 part ii, item 7, 7a\u00a0  \u00a0  and countervailing measures. the u.s. government appealed the panel\u0092s decision and lost its appeal. if the eti provisions are repealed and financially comparable replacement tax legislation is not enacted, the loss of the eti tax benefit to us could be significant.  \u00a0 other potential tax liabilities  \u00a0 we are subject to income taxes in both the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions. significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes. in the ordinary course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. we are regularly under audit by tax authorities. although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different than that which is reflected in historical income tax provisions and accruals. should additional taxes be assessed as a result of an audit or litigation, a material effect on our income tax provision and net income in the period or periods for which that determination is made could result.  \u00a0 finite insurance programs  \u00a0 in addition to conventional third party insurance arrangements, we have entered into captive insurance arrangements for the purpose of protecting against possible catastrophic and other risks not covered by traditional insurance markets. as of june 30, 2003, potential coverage available under captive insurance arrangements was $1.0 billion, subject to deductibles, exclusions, and other restrictions. while we believe these arrangements are an effective way to insure against such risks, the potential liabilities associated with certain of the issues and uncertainties discussed herein could exceed the coverage provided by such arrangements.  \u00a0 other  \u00a0 other issues and uncertainties may include:  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 item 7a.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk  \u00a0 we are exposed to foreign currency, interest rate, and fixed income and equity price risks. a portion of these risks is hedged, but fluctuations could impact our results of operations and financial position. we hedge a portion of anticipated revenue and accounts receivable exposure to foreign currency fluctuations, primarily with option contracts. we monitor our foreign currency exposures daily to maximize the overall effectiveness of our foreign currency hedge positions. principal currencies hedged include the euro, japanese yen, british pound, and canadian dollar. fixed income securities are subject to interest rate risk. the portfolio is diversified and structured to minimize credit risk. we routinely use options to hedge a portion of our exposure to interest rate risk in the event of a catastrophic increase in interest rates. securities held in our equity and other investments portfolio are subject to price risk, and are generally not hedged. however, we use options to hedge our price risk on certain highly volatile equity securities that are held primarily for strategic purposes.  we use a value-at-risk (var) model to estimate and quantify our market risks. var is the expected loss, for a given confidence level, in fair value of our portfolio due to adverse market movements over a defined time horizon. the var model is not intended to represent actual losses in fair value, but is used as a risk estimation and management tool. the model used for currencies and equities is geometric brownian motion, which allows incorporation of optionality with regard to these risk exposures. for interest rate risk, the mean reverting geometric brownian motion is used to reflect the principle that fixed-income securities prices revert to maturity value over time.  value-at-risk is calculated by, first, simulating 10,000 market price paths over 20 days for equities, interest rates and foreign exchange rates, taking into account historical correlations among the different rates and prices. each resulting unique set of equities prices, interest rates, and foreign exchange rates is applied to substantially all individual holdings to re-price each holding. the 250th worst performance (out of 10,000) represents the value-at-risk over 20 days at the 97.5th percentile confidence level. several risk factors are not captured in the model, including liquidity risk, operational risk, credit risk, and legal risk.  certain securities in our equity portfolio are held for strategic purposes. we hedge the value of a portion of these securities through the use of derivative contracts such as put-call collars. in these arrangements, we hedge a security\u0092s market risk below the purchased put strike and forgo most or all of the benefits of the security\u0092s appreciation above the sold call strike, in exchange for premium received for the sold call. we also hold equity securities for general investment return purposes. we have incurred material impairment charges related to these securities. the var amounts disclosed below are used as a risk management tool and reflect an estimate of potential reductions in fair value of our portfolio. losses in fair value over a 20-day holding period can exceed the reported var by significant amounts and can also accumulate over a longer time horizon than the 20-day holding period used in the var analysis. var amounts are not necessarily reflective of potential accounting losses, including determinations of other-than-temporary losses in fair value in accordance with u.s. gaap.  the var numbers are shown separately for interest rate, currency, and equity risks. these var numbers include the underlying portfolio positions and related hedges. we use historical data to estimate var. given reliance on historical data, var is most effective in estimating risk exposures in markets in which there are no fundamental changes or shifts in market conditions. an inherent limitation in var is that the distribution of past changes in market risk factors may not produce accurate predictions of future market risk.  \u00a0  "}}, "Item 8": {}}
