however, efforts to compete with the vertically integrated model may increase our cost of sales and reduce operating margins.  we face intense competition.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0we continue to experience intense competition across all markets for our products and services. our competitors range in size from fortune 100 companies to small, specialized single-product businesses and open source community-based projects. although we believe the breadth of our businesses and product portfolio is a competitive advantage, our competitors that are focused on narrower product lines may be more effective in devoting technical, marketing, and financial resources to compete with us. in addition, barriers to entry in our businesses generally are low and products, once developed, can be distributed broadly and quickly at relatively low cost. open source software vendors are devoting considerable efforts to developing software that mimics the features and functionality of our products, in some cases on the basis of technical specifications for microsoft technologies that we make available. in response to competition, we are developing versions of our products with basic functionality that are sold at lower prices than the standard versions. these competitive pressures may result in decreased sales volumes, price reductions, and/or increased operating costs, such as for marketing and sales incentives, resulting in lower revenue, gross margins and operating income.  we may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property rights.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0protecting our global intellectual property rights and combating unlicensed copying and use of software and other intellectual property is difficult. while piracy adversely affects u.s. revenue, the impact on revenue from outside the u.s. is more significant, particularly in countries where laws are less protective of intellectual property rights. similarly, the absence of harmonized patent laws makes it more difficult to ensure consistent respect for patent rights. throughout the world, we actively educate consumers about the benefits of licensing genuine products and obtaining indemnification benefits for intellectual property risks, and we educate lawmakers about the advantages of a business climate where intellectual property rights are protected. however, continued educational and enforcement efforts may fail to enhance revenue. reductions in the legal protection for software intellectual property rights could adversely affect revenue.  third parties may claim we infringe their intellectual property rights.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0from time to time we receive notices from others claiming we infringe their intellectual property rights. the number of these claims may grow. to resolve these claims we may enter into royalty and licensing agreements on less favorable terms, stop selling or redesign affected products, or pay damages to satisfy indemnification commitments with our customers. such agreements may cause operating margins to decline. we have made and expect to continue making significant expenditures to settle claims related to the use of technology and intellectual property rights as part of our strategy to manage this risk.  we may not be able to protect our source code from copying if there is an unauthorized disclosure of source code.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0source code, the detailed program commands for our operating systems and other software programs, is critical to our business. although we license portions of our application and operating system source code to a number of licensees, we take significant measures to protect the secrecy of large portions of our source code. if an unauthorized disclosure of a significant portion of our source code occurs, we could potentially lose future trade secret protection for that source code. this could make it easier for third parties to compete with our products by copying functionality, which could adversely affect our revenue and operating margins. unauthorized disclosure of source code also could increase the security risks described in the next paragraph.  \u00a0 \u00a0    "

changes in regulatory requirements for software; social, political, labor or economic conditions in a specific country or region; and difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations. although we hedge a portion of our international currency exposure, significant fluctuations in exchange rates between the u.s. dollar and foreign currencies may adversely affect our net revenues.  catastrophic events or geo-political conditions may disrupt our business.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0a disruption or failure of our systems or operations in the event of a major earthquake, weather event, cyber-attack, terrorist attack, or other catastrophic event could cause delays in completing sales, providing services or performing other mission-critical functions. our corporate headquarters, a significant portion of our research and development activities, and certain other critical business operations are located in the seattle, washington area, and we have other business operations in the silicon valley area of california, both of which are near major earthquake faults. a catastrophic event that results in the destruction or disruption of any of our critical business or information technology systems could harm our ability to conduct normal business operations and our operating results. abrupt political change, terrorist activity, and armed conflict pose a risk of general economic disruption in affected countries, which may increase our operating costs. these conditions also may add uncertainty to the timing and budget for technology investment decisions by our customers.  acquisitions and joint ventures may have an adverse effect on our business.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0we expect to continue making acquisitions or entering into joint ventures as part of our long-term business strategy. these transactions involve significant challenges and risks including that the transaction does not advance our business strategy, that we don\u0092t realize a satisfactory return on our investment, or that we experience difficulty in the integration of new employees, business systems, and technology, or diversion of management\u0092s attention from our other businesses. these events could harm our operating results or financial condition.  \u00a0 \u00a0  "

and decreased our income taxes payable by $394 million. as of june\u00a030, 2008, we had $3.2 billion of unrecognized tax benefits of which $2.3 billion, if recognized, would affect our effective tax rate. as of july\u00a01, 2007, we had $7.1 billion of unrecognized tax benefits of which $5.3 billion, if recognized, would affect our effective tax rate. our policy is to include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense. interest totaled $121 million in fiscal year 2008. as of june\u00a030, 2008 and july\u00a01, 2007, we had accrued interest related to uncertain tax positions of $324 million and $863 million, respectively, net of federal income tax benefits, on our balance sheets.  financial condition  cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments totaled $23.7 billion and $23.4 billion as of june\u00a030, 2008 and 2007, respectively. equity and other investments were $6.6 billion and $10.1 billion as of june\u00a030, 2008 and 2007, respectively. our investments consist primarily of fixed-income securities, diversified among industries and individual issuers. our investments are generally liquid and investment grade. the portfolio is invested predominantly in u.s.-dollar-denominated securities, but also includes foreign-denominated securities in order to diversify financial risk. as a result of the special dividend paid in the second quarter of fiscal year 2005 and shares repurchased, our retained deficit, including accumulated other comprehensive income, was $26.6 billion at june\u00a030, 2008. our retained deficit is not expected to impact our future ability to operate or pay dividends given our continuing profitability and strong cash and financial position.  in general, and where applicable, we use quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities to price positions.\u00a0this pricing methodology applies to exchange-traded mutual funds, domestic and international equities, u.s. treasuries, and agency securities.\u00a0if quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities are not available to price positions, then we use inputs other than the quoted prices that are observable either directly or indirectly. assets and liabilities measured using unobservable inputs are an immaterial portion of our portfolio. while we own certain mortgage- and asset-backed fixed-income securities, our portfolio as of june\u00a030, 2008 does not contain direct exposure to subprime mortgages or structured vehicles that derive their value from subprime collateral. the majority of the mortgage-backed securities are collateralized by prime residential mortgages and carry a 100% principal and interest guarantee, primarily from federal national mortgage association, federal home loan mortgage corporation, and government national mortgage association.\u00a0the remainder of the mortgage position is collateralized by high quality international prime residential mortgage loans.  unearned revenue  unearned revenue is comprised of the following items:  volume licensing programs \u0096 represents customer billings for multi-year licensing arrangements, paid either upfront or annually at the beginning of each billing coverage period, which are accounted for as subscriptions with revenue recognized ratably over the billing coverage period.  \u00a0 \u00a0  "

investments. if the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value, we evaluate, among other factors, general market conditions, the duration and extent to which the fair value is less than cost, and our intent and ability to hold the investment. we also consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of and business outlook for the investee, including industry and sector performance, changes in technology, operational and financing cash flow factors, and rating agency actions. once a decline in fair value is determined to be other-than-temporary, an impairment charge is recorded and a new cost basis in the investment is established. if market, industry, and/or investee conditions deteriorate, we may incur future impairments.  sfas no.\u00a0142, goodwill and other intangible assets, requires that goodwill be tested for impairment at the reporting unit level (operating segment or one level below an operating segment) on an annual basis (july 1 for us) and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. these events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate, legal factors, operating performance indicators, competition or sale or disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit. application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment, including the identification of reporting units, assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units, assignment of goodwill to reporting units, and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit. the fair value of each reporting unit is estimated using a discounted cash flow methodology. this analysis requires significant judgments, including estimation of future cash flows, which is dependent on internal forecasts, estimation of the long-term rate of growth for our business, the useful life over which cash flows will occur, and determination of our weighted average cost of capital. changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and goodwill impairment for each reporting unit. we allocate goodwill to reporting units based on the reporting unit expected to benefit from the combination. we evaluate our reporting units on an annual basis and, if necessary, reassign goodwill using a relative fair value allocation approach.  we account for research and development costs in accordance with applicable accounting pronouncements, including sfas no.\u00a02, accounting for research and development costs, and sfas no.\u00a086, accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold, leased, or otherwise marketed. sfas no.\u00a086 specifies that costs incurred internally in researching and developing a computer software product should be charged to expense until technological feasibility has been established for the product. once technological feasibility is established, all software costs should be capitalized until the product is available for general release to customers. judgment is required in determining when technological feasibility of a product is established. we have determined that technological feasibility for our software products is reached after all high-risk development issues have been resolved through coding and testing. generally, this occurs shortly before the products are released to manufacturing.  the outcomes of legal proceedings and claims brought against us are subject to significant uncertainty. sfas no.\u00a05, accounting for contingencies, requires that an estimated loss from a loss contingency such as a legal proceeding or claim should be accrued by a charge to income if it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. disclosure of a contingency is required if there is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss has been incurred. in determining whether a loss should be accrued we evaluate, among other factors, the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss. changes in these factors could materially impact our results of operations, financial position, or our cash flows.  \u00a0 \u00a0    "

payment. under the fair value recognition provisions of this statement, share-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the applicable vesting period of the stock award (generally three to five years) using the straight-line method.  income taxes  income tax expense includes u.s. and international income taxes, plus the provision for u.s. taxes on undistributed earnings of international subsidiaries not deemed to be permanently invested. certain items of income and expense are not reported in tax returns and financial statements in the same year. the tax effect of such temporary differences is reported as deferred income taxes.  financial instruments  we consider all highly liquid interest-earning investments with a maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase to be cash equivalents. the fair value of these investments approximates their carrying value. in general, investments with original maturities of greater than three months and remaining maturities of less than one year are classified as short-term investments. investments with maturities beyond one year may be classified as short-term based on their highly liquid nature and because such marketable securities represent the investment of cash that is available for current operations. all cash equivalents and short-term investments are classified as available for sale and are recorded at market value using the specific identification method. changes in market value are reflected in oci (excluding other-than-temporary impairments).  equity and other investments classified as long-term include both debt and equity instruments. debt securities and publicly traded equity securities are classified as available for sale and are recorded at market using the specific identification method. changes in market value are reflected in oci (excluding other-than-temporary impairments). all other investments, excluding those accounted for using the equity method, are recorded at cost.  we lend certain fixed-income and equity securities to enhance investment income. the loaned securities continue to be carried as investments on our balance sheet. collateral and/or security interest received is determined based upon the underlying security lent and the creditworthiness of the borrower. cash collateral is recorded as an asset with a corresponding liability.  investments are considered to be impaired when a decline in fair value is judged to be other-than-temporary. we employ a systematic methodology on a quarterly basis that considers available quantitative and qualitative evidence in evaluating potential impairment of our investments. if the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value, we evaluate, among other factors, general market conditions, the duration and extent to which the fair value is less than cost, and our intent and ability to hold the investment. we also consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of and business outlook for the investee, including industry and sector performance, changes in technology, operational and financing cash flow factors, and rating agency actions. once a decline in fair value is determined to be other-than-temporary, an impairment charge is recorded and a new cost basis in the investment is established.  we use derivative instruments to manage exposures to foreign currency, equity price, interest rate and credit risks, to enhance returns, and to facilitate portfolio diversification. our objectives for holding derivatives include reducing, eliminating, and efficiently managing the economic impact of these exposures as effectively as possible. derivative instruments are recognized as either assets or liabilities and are measured at fair value. the accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation. for a derivative instrument designated as a fair-value hedge, the gain or loss is recognized in earnings in the period of change together with the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item attributed to the risk being hedged. for a derivative instrument designated as a cash-flow hedge, the effective portion of the derivative\u0092s gain or loss is initially reported as a component of oci and is subsequently recognized in earnings when the hedged exposure affects earnings. the ineffective portion of the gain or loss is recognized in earnings. for options designated either as fair-value or cash-flow hedges, changes in the time value are excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and are recognized in earnings. gains and losses from changes in fair values of derivatives that are not designated as hedges for accounting purposes are recognized in earnings.  \u00a0 \u00a0    "

we voluntarily agreed to extend other elements of the consent decree to november 2009. in october\u00a02007, some states filed a motion with the u.s. district court for the district of columbia seeking to have most of the remaining provisions of the final judgment in the action to which they are party extended for five years. the u.s. department of justice and other states advised the court that they would not seek any extension of the final judgments to which they are party. in january 2008, the court issued a decision granting the states\u0092 motion to extend these additional provisions of the consent decree until november 2009.  in other ongoing investigations, various foreign governments and several state attorneys general have requested information from us concerning competition, privacy, and security issues.  antitrust, unfair competition, and overcharge class actions.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0a large number of antitrust and unfair competition class action lawsuits have been filed against us in various state, federal, and canadian courts on behalf of various classes of direct and indirect purchasers of our pc operating system and certain other software products. we obtained dismissals of damages claims of indirect purchasers under federal law and in 15 states. courts refused to certify classes in two additional states. we have reached agreements to settle all claims that have been made to date in 19 states and the district of columbia.  under the settlements, generally class members can obtain vouchers that entitle them to be reimbursed for purchases of a wide variety of platform-neutral computer hardware and software. the total value of vouchers that we may issue varies by state. we will make available to certain schools a percentage of those vouchers that are not issued or claimed (one-half to two-thirds depending on the state). the total value of vouchers we ultimately issue will depend on the number of class members who make claims and are issued vouchers. the maximum value of vouchers to be issued is approximately $2.7 billion. the actual costs of these settlements will be less than that maximum amount, depending on the number of class members and schools that are issued and redeem vouchers.  the settlements in all states have received final court approval. cases in arizona, mississippi and canada have not been settled. we estimate the total cost to resolve all of these cases will range between $1.7 billion and $1.9 billion. the actual cost depends on factors such as the quantity and mix of products for which claims will be made, the number of eligible class members who ultimately use the vouchers, the nature of hardware and software that is acquired using the vouchers, and the cost of administering the claims. at june\u00a030, 2008, we have recorded a liability related to these claims of approximately $900 million, which reflects our estimated exposure of $1.7 billion less payments made to date of approximately $800 million, mostly for administrative expenses, vouchers, and legal fees.  other antitrust litigation and claims.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0in november 2004, novell, inc. filed a complaint in u.s. district court in utah, now transferred with other cases to maryland, asserting antitrust and unfair competition claims against us related to novell\u0092s ownership of wordperfect and other productivity applications during the period between june 1994 and march 1996. in june\u00a02005, the trial court granted our motion to dismiss four of six claims of the complaint. both parties appealed, and in october 2007, the court of appeals affirmed the decision of the trial court, remanding the case to that court for further proceedings.  \u00a0 \u00a0    "
