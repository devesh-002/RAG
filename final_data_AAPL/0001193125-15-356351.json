content and applications. the company faces substantial competition in these markets from companies that have significant technical, marketing, distribution and other resources, as well as established\nhardware, software and digital content supplier relationships; and the company has a minority market share in the global smartphone market. additionally, the company faces significant price competition as competitors reduce their selling prices and\nattempt to imitate the company\u0092s product features and applications within their own products or, alternatively, collaborate with each other to offer solutions that are more competitive than those they currently offer. the company competes with\nbusiness models that include content provided to users for free. the company also competes with illegitimate ways to obtain third-party digital content and applications. some of the company\u0092s competitors have greater experience, product breadth\nand distribution channels than the company. because some current and potential competitors have substantial resources and/or experience and a lower cost structure, they may be able to provide products and services at little or no profit or even at a\nloss. the company also expects competition to intensify as competitors attempt to imitate the company\u0092s approach to providing components seamlessly within their individual offerings or work collaboratively to offer integrated solutions. the\ncompany\u0092s financial condition and operating results depend substantially on the company\u0092s ability to continually improve ios and ios devices in order to maintain their functional and design advantages.the company is the only authorized maker of hardware using os x, which has a minority market share in the personal computer market. this market has been\ncontracting and is dominated by computer makers using competing operating systems, most notably windows. in the market for personal computers and accessories, the company faces a significant number of competitors, many of which have broader product\nlines, lower priced products and a larger installed customer base. historically, consolidation in this market has resulted in larger competitors. price competition has been particularly intense as competitors selling windows-based personal computers\nhave aggressively cut prices and lowered product margins. an increasing number of internet-enabled devices that include software applications and are smaller and simpler than traditional personal computers compete for market share with the\ncompany\u0092s existing products. the company\u0092s financial condition and operating results also depend on its ability to continually improve the mac platform to maintain its functional and design advantages.there can be no assurance the company will be able to continue to provide products and services that compete effectively.to remain competitive and stimulate customer demand, the company must successfully manage frequent product introductions and transitions.due to the highly volatile and competitive nature of the industries in which the company competes, the company must continually introduce new\nproducts, services and technologies, enhance existing products and services, effectively stimulate customer demand for new and upgraded products and successfully manage the transition to these new and upgraded products. the success of new product\nintroductions depends on a number of factors including, but not limited to, timely and successful product development, market acceptance, the company\u0092s ability to manage the risks associated with new product production ramp-up issues, the\navailability of application software for new products, the effective management of purchase commitments and inventory levels in line with anticipated product demand, the availability of products in appropriate quantities and at expected costs to\nmeet anticipated demand and the risk that new products may have quality or other defects or deficiencies in the early stages of introduction. accordingly, the company cannot determine in advance the ultimate effect of new product introductions and\ntransitions.the company depends on the performance of distributors, carriers and other resellers.the company distributes its products through cellular network carriers, wholesalers, national and regional retailers and value-added resellers, many of\nwhom distribute products from competing manufacturers. the company also sells its products and third-party products in most of its major markets directly to education, enterprise and government customers and consumers and small and mid-sized\nbusinesses through its online and retail stores.carriers providing cellular network service for iphone typically subsidize users\u0092 purchases of\nthe device. there is no assurance that such subsidies will be continued at all or in the same amounts upon renewal of the company\u0092s agreements with these carriers or in agreements the company enters into with new carriers.apple inc. | 2015 form 10-k | 9"}, "1": {"tables": {}, "text": "many resellers have narrow operating margins and have been adversely affected in the past by weak economic\nconditions. some resellers have perceived the expansion of the company\u0092s direct sales as conflicting with their business interests as distributors and resellers of the company\u0092s products. such a perception could discourage resellers from\ninvesting resources in the distribution and sale of the company\u0092s products or lead them to limit or cease distribution of those products. the company has invested and will continue to invest in programs to enhance reseller sales, including\nstaffing selected resellers\u0092 stores with company employees and contractors, and improving product placement displays. these programs could require a substantial investment while providing no assurance of return or incremental revenue. the\nfinancial condition of these resellers could weaken, these resellers could stop distributing the company\u0092s products, or uncertainty regarding demand for some or all of the company\u0092s products could cause resellers to reduce their ordering\nand marketing of the company\u0092s products.the company faces substantial inventory and other asset risk in addition to purchase\ncommitment cancellation risk.the company records a write-down for product and component inventories that have become obsolete or exceed\nanticipated demand or net realizable value and accrues necessary cancellation fee reserves for orders of excess products and components. the company also reviews its long-lived assets, including capital assets held at its suppliers\u0092 facilities\nand inventory prepayments, for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. if the company determines that impairment has occurred, it records a write-down equal to the amount by which\nthe carrying value of the assets exceeds its fair value. although the company believes its provisions related to inventory, capital assets, inventory prepayments and other assets and purchase commitments are currently adequate, no assurance can be\ngiven that the company will not incur additional related charges given the rapid and unpredictable pace of product obsolescence in the industries in which the company competes.the company must order components for its products and build inventory in advance of product announcements and shipments. consistent with industry\npractice, components are normally acquired through a combination of purchase orders, supplier contracts and open orders, in each case based on projected demand. where appropriate,\u00a0the\u00a0purchases are applied to\u00a0inventory component\nprepayments\u00a0that are\u00a0outstanding with the\u00a0respective supplier. purchase commitments typically cover forecasted component and manufacturing requirements for periods up to 150 days. because the company\u0092s markets are volatile,\ncompetitive and subject to rapid technology and price changes, there is a risk the company will forecast incorrectly and order or produce excess or insufficient amounts of components or products, or not fully utilize firm purchase commitments.future operating results depend upon the company\u0092s ability to obtain components in sufficient quantities.because the company currently obtains components from single or limited sources, the company is subject to significant supply and pricing risks. many\ncomponents, including those that are available from multiple sources, are at times subject to industry-wide shortages and significant commodity pricing fluctuations. while the company has entered into agreements for the supply of many components,\nthere can be no assurance that the company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms, or at all. a number of suppliers of components may suffer from poor financial conditions, which can lead to business failure for the\nsupplier or consolidation within a particular industry, further limiting the company\u0092s ability to obtain sufficient quantities of components. the effects of global or regional economic conditions on\u00a0the company\u0092s suppliers, described\nin \u0093global and regional economic conditions could materially adversely affect the company\u0094 above, also could affect the company\u0092s ability to obtain components. therefore, the company remains subject to significant risks\nof supply shortages and price increases.the company and other participants in the markets for mobile communication and media devices and personal\ncomputers also compete for various components with other industries that have experienced increased demand for their products. the company uses some custom components that are not common to the rest of these industries. the company\u0092s new\nproducts often utilize custom components available from only one source. when a component or product uses new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers\u0092 yields have matured or manufacturing capacity has increased.\ncontinued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at all, may be affected for any number of reasons, including if those suppliers decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet\nthe company\u0092s requirements. the supply of components for a new or existing product could be delayed or constrained, or a key manufacturing vendor could delay shipments of completed products to the company.apple inc. | 2015 form

it sells. failure to do so could result in lost revenue, significant warranty and other expenses and harm to the company\u0092s reputation.the company relies on access to third-party digital content, which may not be available to the company on commercially reasonable terms\nor at all.the company contracts with numerous third parties to offer their digital content. this includes the right to sell currently\navailable music, movies, tv shows and books. the licensing or other distribution arrangements with these third parties are for relatively short terms and do not guarantee the continuation or renewal of these arrangements on reasonable terms, if at\nall. some third-party content providers and distributors currently or in the future may offer competing products and services, and could take action to make it more difficult or impossible for the company to license or otherwise distribute their\ncontent in the future. other content owners, providers or distributors may seek to limit the company\u0092s access to, or increase the cost of, such content. the company may be unable to continue to offer a wide variety of content at reasonable\nprices with acceptable usage rules, or continue to expand its geographic reach. failure to obtain the right to make available third-party digital content, or to make available such content on commercially reasonable terms, could have a material\nadverse impact on the company\u0092s financial condition and operating results.some third-party digital content providers require the company to\nprovide digital rights management and other security solutions. if requirements change, the company may have to develop or license new technology to provide these solutions. there is no assurance the company will be able to develop or license such\nsolutions at a reasonable cost and in a timely manner. in addition, certain countries have passed or may propose and adopt legislation that would force the company to license its digital rights

software applications and\nservices for the company\u0092s products. if third-party software applications and services cease to be developed and maintained for the company\u0092s products, customers may choose not to buy the company\u0092s products.with respect to its mac products, the company believes the availability of third-party software applications and\nservices depends in part on the developers\u0092 perception and analysis of the relative benefits of developing, maintaining and upgrading such software for the company\u0092s products compared to windows-based products. this analysis may be based\non factors such as the market position of the company and its products, the anticipated revenue that may be generated, expected future growth of mac sales and the costs of developing such applications and services. if the company\u0092s minority\nshare of the global personal computer market causes developers to question the mac\u0092s prospects, developers could be less inclined to develop or upgrade software for the company\u0092s mac products and more inclined to devote their resources to\ndeveloping and upgrading software for the larger windows market.with respect to ios devices, the company relies on the continued availability and\ndevelopment of compelling and innovative software applications, which are distributed through a single distribution channel, the app store. ios devices are subject to rapid technological change, and, if third-party developers are unable to or choose\nnot to keep up with this pace of change, third-party applications might not successfully operate and may result in dissatisfied customers. as with applications for the company\u0092s mac products, the availability and development of these\napplications also depend on

third-party intellectual property, which may not be available to the company on commercially reasonable\nterms or at all.many of the company\u0092s products include third-party intellectual property, which requires licenses from those third\nparties. based on past experience and industry practice, the company believes such licenses generally can be obtained on reasonable terms. there is, however, no assurance that the necessary licenses can be obtained on acceptable terms or at all.\nfailure to obtain the right to use third-party intellectual property, or to use such intellectual property on

claims that\nhave not yet been fully resolved and that have arisen in the ordinary course of business, and additional claims may arise in the future.for\nexample, technology companies, including many of the company\u0092s competitors, frequently enter into litigation based on allegations of patent infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. in addition, patent holding companies\nseek to monetize patents they have purchased or otherwise obtained. as the company has grown, the intellectual property rights claims against it have increased and may continue to increase. in particular, the company\u0092s cellular enabled products\ncompete with products from mobile communication and media device companies that hold significant patent portfolios, and the number of patent claims against the company has significantly increased.\u00a0the company is vigorously defending\ninfringement actions in courts in a number of u.s. jurisdictions and before the u.s. international trade commission, as well as internationally in various countries. the plaintiffs in these actions frequently seek injunctions and substantial\ndamages.regardless of the scope or validity of such patents or\u00a0other intellectual property rights, or the merits of any claims by potential or\nactual litigants, the company may have to engage in protracted litigation. if the company is found to infringe one or more patents or other intellectual property rights, regardless of whether it can develop non-infringing technology, it may be\nrequired to pay substantial damages or royalties to a third-party, or it may be subject to a temporary or permanent injunction prohibiting the company from marketing or selling certain products.in certain cases, the company may consider the desirability of entering into licensing agreements, although no assurance can be given that such licenses\ncan be obtained on acceptable terms or that litigation will not occur. these licenses may also significantly increase the company\u0092s operating expenses.apple inc. | 2015 form 10-k | 12"}, "4": {"tables": {}, "text": "regardless of the merit of particular claims, litigation may be

certification and regulation by governmental and standardization\nbodies, as well as by cellular network carriers for use on their networks.\u00a0these certification processes are extensive and time consuming, and could result in additional testing requirements, product modifications, or delays in product shipment\ndates, or could preclude the company from selling certain products.compliance with

other quarters due in part to seasonal holiday demand. additionally, new product introductions can significantly impact net sales, product costs and operating expenses. further, the\ncompany generates a majority of its net sales from a single product and a decline in demand for that product could significantly impact quarterly net sales. the company could also be subject to unexpected developments late in a quarter, such as\nlower-than-anticipated demand for the company\u0092s products, issues with new product introductions, an internal systems failure, or failure of one of the company\u0092s logistics, components supply, or manufacturing partners.the company\u0092s stock price is subject to volatility.the company\u0092s stock price has experienced substantial price volatility in the past and may continue to do so in the future. additionally, the\ncompany, the technology industry and the stock market as a whole have experienced extreme stock price and volume fluctuations that have affected stock prices in ways that may have been unrelated to these companies\u0092 operating performance. price\nvolatility over a given period may cause the average price at which the company repurchases its own stock to exceed the stock\u0092s price at a given point in time. the company believes its stock price should reflect expectations of future growth\nand profitability. the company also believes its stock price should reflect expectations that its cash dividend will continue at current levels or grow and that its current share repurchase program will be fully consummated. future dividends are\nsubject to declaration by the company\u0092s board of directors, and the company\u0092s share repurchase program does not obligate it to acquire any specific number of shares. if the company fails to meet expectations related to future growth,\nprofitability, dividends, share repurchases or other market expectations, its stock price may decline significantly, which could have a material adverse impact on investor confidence and employee retention.the company\u0092s financial performance is subject to risks associated with changes in the value of the u.s. dollar versus local\ncurrencies.the company\u0092s primary exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates relates to non-u.s. dollar-denominated sales\nand operating expenses worldwide. weakening of foreign currencies relative to the u.s. dollar adversely affects the u.s. dollar value of the company\u0092s foreign currency-denominated sales and earnings, and generally leads the company to raise\ninternational pricing, potentially reducing demand for the company\u0092s products. margins on sales of the company\u0092s products in foreign countries and on sales of products that include components obtained from foreign suppliers, could be\nmaterially adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. in some circumstances, for competitive or other reasons, the company may decide not to raise local prices to fully offset the dollar\u0092s strengthening, or at all, which\nwould adversely affect the u.s. dollar value of the company\u0092s foreign currency-denominated sales and earnings. conversely, a strengthening of foreign currencies relative to the u.s. dollar, while generally beneficial to the company\u0092s\nforeign currency-denominated sales and earnings, could cause the company to reduce international pricing and incur losses on its foreign currency derivative instruments, thereby limiting the benefit. additionally, strengthening of foreign currencies\nmay also increase the company\u0092s cost of product components denominated in those currencies, thus adversely affecting gross margins.the company\nuses derivative instruments, such as foreign currency forward and option contracts, to hedge certain exposures to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. the use of such hedging activities may not offset any, or more than a portion, of the\nadverse financial effects of unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates over the limited time the hedges are in place.the company\nis exposed to credit risk and fluctuations in the market values of its investment portfolio.given the global nature of its business, the\ncompany has both domestic and international investments. credit ratings and pricing of the company\u0092s investments can be negatively affected by liquidity, credit deterioration, financial results, economic risk, political risk, sovereign risk or\nother factors. as a result, the value and liquidity of the company\u0092s cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities may fluctuate substantially. therefore, although the company has not realized any significant losses on its cash, cash\nequivalents and marketable securities, future fluctuations in their value could result in a significant realized loss.apple inc. | 2015 form 10-k | 16"}, "8": {"tables": {}, "text": "the company is exposed to

mid-sized businesses and education, enterprise and government customers. a substantial majority of the company\u0092s outstanding trade receivables are not covered by collateral, third-party

to long-term supply agreements were concentrated among a few individual vendors located primarily in asia. while the company has procedures to monitor and limit exposure to credit risk on its trade and vendor\nnon-trade receivables, as well as long-term prepayments, there can be no assurance such procedures will effectively limit its credit risk and avoid losses.the company could be subject to changes in its tax rates, the adoption of new u.s. or international tax legislation or exposure to\nadditional tax liabilities.the company is subject to taxes in the u.s. and numerous foreign jurisdictions, including ireland, where a number\nof the company\u0092s subsidiaries are organized. due to economic and political conditions, tax rates in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change. the company\u0092s effective tax rates could be affected by changes in the mix of\nearnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, or changes in tax laws or their interpretation, including in the u.s. and ireland. for example, in june 2014, the european\ncommission opened a formal investigation of ireland to examine whether decisions by the tax authorities with regard to the corporate income tax to be paid by two of the company\u0092s irish subsidiaries comply with european union rules on state aid.\nif the european commission were to conclude against ireland, it could require ireland to recover from the company past taxes covering a period of up to 10 years reflective of the disallowed state aid, and such amount could be material.the company is also subject to the examination of its tax returns and other tax matters by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities and\ngovernmental bodies. the company regularly assesses the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of its provision for taxes. there can be no assurance as to the outcome of these examinations. if\nthe company\u0092s effective tax rates were to increase, particularly in the u.s. or ireland, or if the ultimate determination of the company\u0092s taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued, the company\u0092s financial\ncondition, operating results and cash flows could be adversely affected.apple inc. |

the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. actual results may differ from\nthese estimates, and such differences may be material.management believes the company\u0092s critical accounting policies and estimates are those\nrelated to revenue recognition, valuation and impairment of marketable securities, inventory valuation and valuation of manufacturing-related assets and estimated purchase commitment cancellation fees, warranty costs, income taxes, and legal and\nother contingencies. management considers these policies critical because they are both important to the portrayal of the company\u0092s financial condition and operating results, and they require management to make judgments and estimates about\ninherently uncertain matters. the company\u0092s senior management has reviewed these critical accounting policies and related disclosures with the audit and finance committee of the company\u0092s board of directors.revenue recognitionnet sales consist primarily of revenue\nfrom the sale of hardware, software, digital content and applications, accessories, and service and support contracts. the company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the sales price is fixed\nor determinable and collection is probable. product is considered delivered to the customer once it has been shipped and title, risk of loss and rewards of ownership have been transferred. for most of the company\u0092s product sales, these criteria\nare met at the time the product is shipped. for online sales to individuals, for some sales to education customers in the u.s., and for certain other sales, the company defers revenue until the customer receives the product because the company\nretains a portion of the risk of loss on these sales during transit. for payment terms in excess of the company\u0092s standard payment terms, revenue is recognized as payments become due unless the company has positive evidence that the sales price\nis fixed or determinable, such as a successful history of collection, without concession, on comparable arrangements. the company recognizes revenue from the sale of hardware products, software bundled with hardware that is essential to the\nfunctionality of the hardware and third-party digital content sold on the itunes store in accordance with general revenue recognition accounting guidance. the company recognizes revenue in accordance with industry-specific software accounting\nguidance for the following types of sales transactions: (i)\u00a0standalone sales of software products, (ii)\u00a0sales of software upgrades and (iii)\u00a0sales of software bundled with hardware not essential to the functionality of the hardware.for multi-element arrangements that include hardware products containing software essential to the hardware product\u0092s functionality,\nundelivered software elements that relate to the hardware product\u0092s essential software and/or undelivered non-software services, the company allocates revenue to all deliverables based on their relative selling prices. in such circumstances,\nthe company uses a hierarchy to determine the selling price to be used for allocating revenue to deliverables: (i)\u00a0vendor-specific objective evidence of fair value (\u0093vsoe\u0094), (ii)\u00a0third-party evidence of selling price\n(\u0093tpe\u0094) and (iii)\u00a0best estimate of selling price (\u0093esp\u0094). vsoe generally exists only when the company sells the deliverable separately and is the price actually charged by the company for that deliverable. esps reflect the\ncompany\u0092s best estimates of what the selling prices of elements would be if they were sold regularly on a stand-alone basis.apple inc. | 2015 form 10-k | 33"}, "10": {"tables": {}, "text": "for sales of qualifying versions of ios devices, mac, apple watch and apple tv, the

amortization for unspecified software upgrades and non-software services related to future sales of these devices could change. factors subject to change include the\nunspecified software upgrade

price protection, the company recognizes revenue net of the estimated amount to be refunded, provided the refund amount can be reasonably and reliably estimated and the other conditions for revenue recognition\nhave been met. the company\u0092s policy requires that, if refunds cannot be reliably estimated, revenue is not recognized until reliable estimates can be made or the price protection lapses. for the company\u0092s other customer incentive programs,\nthe estimated cost is recognized at the later of the date at which the company has sold the product or the date at which the program is offered. the company also records reductions to revenue for expected future product returns based on the\ncompany\u0092s historical experience. future market conditions and product transitions may require the company to increase customer incentive programs that could result in reductions to future revenue. additionally, certain customer incentive\nprograms require management to estimate the number of customers who will actually redeem the incentive. management\u0092s estimates are based on historical experience and the specific terms and conditions of particular incentive programs. if a\ngreater than estimated proportion of customers redeems such incentives, the company would be required to record additional reductions to revenue, which would have an adverse impact on the company\u0092s operating results.valuation and impairment of marketable securitiesthe\ncompany\u0092s investments in available-for-sale securities are reported at fair value. unrealized gains and losses related to changes in the fair value of securities are recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income, net of tax, in the\ncompany\u0092s consolidated balance sheets. changes in the fair value of available-for-sale securities impact the company\u0092s net income only when such securities are sold or an other-than-temporary impairment is recognized. realized gains and\nlosses on the sale of securities are determined by specific identification of each security\u0092s cost basis. the company regularly reviews its investment portfolio to determine if any security is other-than-temporarily impaired, which would\nrequire the company to record an impairment charge in the period any such determination is made. in making this judgment, the company evaluates, among other things, the duration and extent to which the fair value of a security is less than its cost;\nthe financial condition of the issuer and any changes thereto; and the company\u0092s intent to sell, or whether it will more likely than not be required to sell, the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis. the company\u0092s\nassessment on whether a security is other-than-temporarily impaired could change in the future due to new developments or changes in assumptions related to any particular security, which would have an adverse impact on the company\u0092s operating\nresults.inventory valuation and valuation of manufacturing-related assets and estimated purchase commitment cancellation feesthe company must purchase components and build inventory in advance of product shipments and has invested in manufacturing-related assets, including\ncapital assets held at its suppliers\u0092 facilities. in addition, the company has made prepayments to certain of its suppliers associated with long-term supply agreements to secure supply of inventory components. the company records a write-down\nfor inventories of components and products, including third-party products held for resale, which have become obsolete or are in excess of anticipated demand or net realizable value. the company performs a detailed review of inventory that considers\nmultiple factors including demand forecasts, product life cycle status, product development plans, current sales levels and component cost trends. the company also reviews its manufacturing-related capital assets and inventory prepayments for\nimpairment whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. if the company determines that an asset is not recoverable, it records an impairment loss equal to the amount by which the carrying value\nof such an asset exceeds its fair value.the industries in which the company competes are subject to a rapid and unpredictable pace of product and\ncomponent obsolescence and demand changes. in certain circumstances the company may be required to record additional write-downs of inventory and/or manufacturing-related assets. these circumstances include future demand or market conditions for the\ncompany\u0092s products being less favorable than forecasted, unforeseen technological changes or changes to the company\u0092s product development plans that negatively impact the utility of any of these assets, or significant deterioration in the\nfinancial condition of one or more of the company\u0092s suppliers that hold any of the company\u0092s manufacturing-related assets or to whom the company has made an inventory prepayment. such write-downs would adversely affect the company\u0092s\nfinancial condition and operating results in the period when the write-downs were recorded.apple inc. | 2015 form 10-k | 34"}, "11": {"tables": {}, "text": "the company

the company regularly reviews these estimates to assess the adequacy of its recorded warranty liabilities or the current installed base of products subject to warranty protection and adjusts the

rates that\napply to taxable income in effect for the years in which those tax assets and liabilities are expected to be realized or settled. the company records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is believed more likely than\nnot to be realized.the company recognizes tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will\nbe sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than\n50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement.management believes it is more likely than not that forecasted income, including income\nthat may be generated as a result of certain tax planning strategies, together with future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, will be sufficient to fully recover the deferred tax assets. in the event that the company determines all\nor part of the net deferred tax assets are not realizable in the future, the company will record an adjustment to the valuation allowance that would be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made. in addition, the calculation of tax\nliabilities involves significant judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of gaap and complex tax laws. resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with management\u0092s expectations could have a material\nimpact on the company\u0092s financial condition and operating results.legal and other contingenciesas discussed in part i, item\u00a03 of this form 10-k under the heading \u0093legal proceedings\u0094 and in part ii, item\u00a08 of this form 10-k in the\nnotes to consolidated financial statements in note 10, \u0093commitments and contingencies,\u0094 the company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business. the company records a liability when it\nis probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable. there is significant judgment required in both the probability determination and as to whether an exposure can be reasonably estimated. in the opinion of management,\nthere was not at least a reasonable possibility the company may have incurred a material loss, or a material loss in excess of a recorded accrual, with respect to loss contingencies for asserted legal and other claims. however, the outcome of legal\nproceedings and claims brought against the company is subject to significant uncertainty. therefore, although management considers the likelihood of such an outcome to be remote, if one or more of these legal matters were resolved against the\ncompany in a reporting period for amounts in excess of management\u0092s expectations, the company\u0092s consolidated financial statements for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected.apple inc. | 2015 form 10-k | 35"}}, "Item 7A": {"0": {"tables": {}, "text": "to provide a meaningful assessment of the foreign currency risk associated with certain of the\ncompany\u0092s foreign currency derivative positions, the company performed a sensitivity analysis using a value-at-risk (\u0093var\u0094) model to assess the potential impact of fluctuations in exchange rates. the var model consisted of using a\nmonte carlo simulation to generate thousands of random market price paths assuming normal market conditions. the var is the maximum expected loss in fair value, for a given confidence interval, to the company\u0092s foreign currency derivative\npositions due to adverse movements in rates. the var model is not intended to represent actual losses but is used as a risk estimation and management tool. the model assumes normal market conditions. forecasted transactions, firm commitments and\nassets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies were excluded from the model. based on the results of the model, the company estimates with 95% confidence a maximum one-day loss in fair value of $342 million as of september\u00a026, 2015\ncompared to a maximum one-day loss in fair value of $240 million as of september\u00a027, 2014. because the company uses foreign currency instruments for hedging purposes, the loss in fair value incurred on those instruments are generally offset by\nincreases in the fair value of the underlying exposures.actual future gains and losses associated with the company\u0092s investment portfolio and\nderivative positions may differ materially from the sensitivity analyses performed as of september\u00a026, 2015 due to the inherent limitations associated with predicting

sales consist primarily of revenue from the sale of hardware, software, digital content and applications, accessories, and service\nand support contracts. the company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the sales price is fixed or determinable and collection is probable. product is considered delivered to the customer once\nit has been shipped and title, risk of loss and rewards of ownership have been transferred. for most of the company\u0092s product sales, these criteria are met at the time the product is shipped. for online sales to individuals, for some sales to\neducation customers in the u.s., and for certain other sales, the company defers revenue until the customer receives the product because the company retains a portion of the risk of loss on these sales during transit. for payment terms in excess of\nthe company\u0092s standard payment terms, revenue is recognized as payments become due unless the company has positive evidence that the sales price is fixed or determinable, such as a successful history of collection, without concession, on\ncomparable arrangements. the company recognizes revenue from the sale of hardware products, software bundled with hardware that is essential to the functionality of the hardware and third-party digital content sold on the itunes store in accordance\nwith general revenue recognition accounting guidance. the company recognizes revenue in accordance with industry specific software accounting guidance for the following types of sales transactions: (i)\u00a0standalone sales of software products,\n(ii)\u00a0sales of software upgrades and (iii)\u00a0sales of software bundled with hardware not essential to the functionality of the hardware.for\nthe sale of most third-party products, the company recognizes revenue based on the gross amount billed to customers because the company establishes its own pricing for such products, retains related inventory risk for physical products, is the\nprimary obligor to the customer and assumes the credit risk for amounts billed to its customers. for third-party applications sold through the app store and mac app store and certain digital content sold through the itunes store, the company does\nnot determine the selling price of the products and is not the primary obligor to the customer. therefore, the company accounts for such sales on a net basis by recognizing in net sales only the commission it retains from each sale. the portion of\nthe gross amount billed to customers that is remitted by the company to third-party app developers and certain digital content owners is not reflected in the company\u0092s consolidated statements of operations.apple inc. | 2015 form 10-k | 44"}, "6": {"tables": {}, "text": "the company records deferred revenue when it receives payments in advance of the delivery of products or the\nperformance of services. this includes amounts that have been deferred for unspecified and specified software upgrade rights and non-software services that are attached to hardware and software products. the company sells gift cards redeemable at\nits retail and online stores, and also sells gift cards redeemable on itunes store, app store, mac app store and ibooks store for the purchase of digital content and software. the company records deferred revenue upon the sale of the card, which is\nrelieved upon redemption of the card by the customer. revenue from applecare service and support contracts is deferred and recognized over the service coverage periods. applecare service and support contracts typically include extended phone\nsupport, repair services, web-based support resources and diagnostic tools offered under the company\u0092s standard limited warranty.the company\nrecords reductions to revenue for estimated commitments related to price protection and other customer incentive programs. for transactions involving price protection, the company recognizes revenue net of the estimated amount to be refunded. for\nthe company\u0092s other customer incentive programs, the estimated cost of these programs is recognized at the later of the date at which the company has sold the product or the date at which the program is offered. the company also records\nreductions to revenue for expected future product returns based on the company\u0092s historical experience. revenue is recorded net of taxes collected from customers that are remitted to governmental authorities, with the collected taxes recorded\nas current liabilities until remitted to the relevant government authority.revenue recognition for arrangements with multiple deliverablesfor multi-element arrangements that include hardware products containing software essential to the hardware product\u0092s functionality, undelivered\nsoftware elements that relate to the hardware product\u0092s essential software, and undelivered non-software services, the company allocates revenue to all deliverables based on their relative selling prices. in such circumstances, the company uses\na hierarchy to determine the selling price to be used for allocating revenue to deliverables: (i)\u00a0vendor-specific objective evidence of fair value (\u0093vsoe\u0094), (ii)\u00a0third-party evidence of selling price (\u0093tpe\u0094) and\n(iii)\u00a0best estimate of selling price (\u0093esp\u0094). vsoe generally exists only when the company sells the deliverable separately and is the price actually charged by the company for that deliverable. esps reflect the company\u0092s best\nestimates of what the selling prices of elements would be if they were sold regularly on a stand-alone basis. for multi-element arrangements accounted for in accordance with industry specific software accounting guidance, the company allocates\nrevenue to all deliverables based on the vsoe of each element, and if vsoe does not exist revenue is recognized when elements lacking vsoe are delivered.for sales of qualifying versions of iphone, ipad and ipod touch (\u0093ios devices\u0094), mac, apple watch and apple tv, the company has indicated it\nmay from time to time provide future unspecified software upgrades to the device\u0092s essential software and/or non-software services free of charge. the company has identified up to three deliverables regularly included in arrangements involving\nthe sale of these devices. the first deliverable, which represents the substantial portion of the allocated sales price, is the hardware and software essential to the functionality of the hardware device delivered at the time of sale. the second\ndeliverable is the embedded right included with qualifying devices to receive on a when-and-if-available basis, future unspecified software upgrades relating to the product\u0092s essential software. the third deliverable is the non-software\nservices to be provided to qualifying devices. the company allocates revenue between these deliverables using the relative selling price method. because the company has neither vsoe nor tpe for these deliverables, the allocation of revenue is based\non the company\u0092s esps. revenue allocated to the delivered hardware and the related essential software is recognized at the time of sale provided the other conditions for revenue recognition have been met. revenue allocated to the embedded\nunspecified software upgrade rights and the non-software services is deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis over the estimated period the software upgrades and non-software services are expected to be provided. cost of sales related to\ndelivered hardware and related essential software, including estimated warranty costs, are recognized at the time of sale. costs incurred to provide non-software services are recognized as cost of sales as incurred, and engineering and sales and\nmarketing costs are recognized as operating expenses as incurred.the company\u0092s process for determining its esp for deliverables without vsoe\nor tpe considers multiple factors that may vary depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each

of the product.beginning in september 2015, the company reduced the combined esps for ios devices and mac between $5 and $10 to\nreflect the increase in competitive offers for similar products at little to no cost for users, which reduces the amount the company could reasonably charge for these deliverables on a standalone basis.shipping costsamounts billed to customers related to

based on the closing fair market value of the company\u0092s common stock on the\ndate of grant. the company recognizes share-based compensation cost over the award\u0092s requisite service period on a straight-line basis for time-based rsus and on a graded basis for rsus that are contingent on the achievement of performance\nconditions. the company recognizes a benefit from share-based compensation in the consolidated statements of shareholders\u0092 equity if an excess tax benefit is realized. in addition, the company recognizes the indirect effects of share-based\ncompensation on

securities include outstanding stock options, shares to be purchased under the company\u0092s employee\nstock purchase plan, unvested restricted stock and unvested rsus. the dilutive effect of potentially dilutive securities is reflected in diluted earnings per share by application of the treasury stock method. under the treasury stock method, an\nincrease in the fair market value of the

as short-term and marketable debt securities with maturities greater than 12 months are classified as long-term. marketable equity\nsecurities, including mutual funds, are classified as either short-term or long-term based on the nature of each security and its availability for use in current operations. the company\u0092s marketable debt and equity securities are carried at\nfair value,

losses believed to be\nother-than-temporary which are reported in earnings in the current period. the cost of securities sold is based upon the specific identification method.derivative financial instrumentsthe company accounts for its\nderivative instruments as either assets or liabilities and carries them at fair value.for derivative instruments that hedge the exposure to\nvariability in expected future cash flows that are designated as cash flow hedges, the effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative instrument is reported as a component of aoci in shareholders\u0092 equity and reclassified into earnings\nin the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. the ineffective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative instrument, if any, is recognized in earnings in the current period. to receive hedge accounting\ntreatment, cash flow hedges must be highly effective in offsetting changes to expected future cash flows on hedged transactions. for options designated as cash flow hedges, changes in the time value are excluded from the assessment of hedge\neffectiveness and are recognized in earnings.for derivative instruments that hedge the exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset or a\nliability and that are designated as fair value hedges, both the net gain or loss on the derivative instrument as well as the

underlying building; between one to five years for machinery and equipment, including product tooling and manufacturing process\nequipment; and the shorter of lease terms or ten years for leasehold improvements. the company capitalizes eligible costs to acquire or develop internal-use software that are incurred subsequent to the preliminary project stage. capitalized costs\nrelated to internal-use software are amortized using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which range from three to five years. depreciation and amortization expense on property and equipment was $9.2 billion, $6.9\nbillion and $5.8 billion during 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.long-lived assets including goodwill and other acquired intangible assetsthe company reviews property, plant and equipment, inventory component prepayments and certain identifiable intangibles, excluding goodwill, for\nimpairment. long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. recoverability of these assets is measured by comparison of their carrying amounts\nto future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate. if property, plant and equipment, inventory component prepayments and certain identifiable intangibles are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized equals the\namount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds its fair value.the company does not amortize goodwill and intangible assets with\nindefinite useful lives, rather such assets are required to be tested for impairment at least annually or sooner whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the assets may be impaired. the company performs its goodwill and intangible\nasset impairment tests in the fourth quarter of each year. the company did not recognize any impairment charges related to goodwill or indefinite lived intangible assets during 2015, 2014 and 2013. the company established reporting units based on\nits current reporting structure. for purposes of testing goodwill for impairment, goodwill has been allocated to these reporting units to the extent it relates to each reporting unit. in 2015 and 2014, the company\u0092s goodwill was primarily\nallocated to the americas and europe reporting units.the company amortizes its intangible assets with definite useful lives over their estimated\nuseful lives and reviews these assets for impairment. the company typically amortizes its acquired intangible assets with definite useful lives over periods from three to seven years.fair value measurementsthe company applies fair value\naccounting for all financial assets and liabilities and non-financial assets and liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis. the company defines fair value as the price that would be\nreceived from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. when determining the fair value measurements for assets and liabilities, which are required to be recorded\nat fair value, the company considers the principal or most advantageous market in which the company would transact and the market-based risk measurements or assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, such as\nrisks inherent in valuation techniques, transfer restrictions and credit risk. fair value is estimated by applying the following hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value into three levels and bases the categorization within\nthe hierarchy upon the lowest level of input that is available and significant to the fair value measurement:level 1 \u0096 quoted prices in active markets\nfor identical assets or liabilities.level 2 \u0096 observable inputs other than quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and\nliabilities, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in inactive markets, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.level 3 \u0096 inputs that are generally unobservable and typically reflect management\u0092s estimate of assumptions that market participants\nwould use in pricing the asset or liability.apple inc. | 2015 form 10-k | 48"}, "10": {"tables": {"0": [["2015", "AdjustedCost", "UnrealizedGains",

of credit exposure to any one issuer. the policy\ngenerally requires investments to be investment grade, with the primary objective of minimizing the potential risk of principal loss. fair values were determined for each individual security in the investment portfolio. when evaluating an investment\nfor other-than-temporary impairment the company reviews factors such as the length of time and extent to which fair value has been below its cost basis, the financial condition of the issuer and any changes thereto, changes in market interest rates\nand the company\u0092s intent to sell, or whether it is more likely than not it will be required to sell the investment before recovery of the investment\u0092s cost basis.derivative financial instrumentsthe company may use\nderivatives to

will depend on actual market\nconditions during the remaining life of the instruments.the company generally enters into master netting arrangements, which are designed to reduce\ncredit risk by permitting net settlement of transactions with the same counterparty. to further limit credit risk, the company generally enters into collateral security arrangements that provide for collateral to be received or posted when the net\nfair value of certain financial instruments fluctuates from contractually established thresholds. the company presents its derivative assets and derivative liabilities at their gross fair values in its consolidated balance sheets. the net cash\ncollateral received by the company related to derivative instruments under its collateral security arrangements was $1.0 billion as of september\u00a026, 2015 and $2.1 billion as of september\u00a027, 2014.under master netting arrangements with the respective counterparties to the company\u0092s derivative contracts, the\u00a0company is allowed to net\nsettle transactions with a single net amount payable by one party to the other. as of september\u00a026, 2015 and september\u00a027, 2014, the potential effects of these rights of set-off associated with the company\u0092s derivative contracts,\nincluding the effects of collateral, would be a reduction to both derivative assets and derivative liabilities of\u00a0$2.2\u00a0billion and $1.6 billion, respectively, resulting in net derivative liabilities of\u00a0$78\u00a0million and $549\nmillion, respectively.accounts receivabletrade receivablesthe company has considerable trade receivables outstanding with its third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers, value-added resellers,\nsmall and mid-sized businesses and education, enterprise and government customers. the company generally does not require collateral from its customers; however, the company will require collateral in certain instances to limit credit risk. in\naddition, when possible, the company attempts to limit credit risk on trade receivables with credit insurance for certain customers or by requiring third-party financing, loans or leases to support credit exposure. these credit-financing\narrangements are directly between the third-party financing company and the end customer. as such, the company generally does not assume any recourse or credit risk sharing related to any of these arrangements.as of september\u00a026, 2015, the company had one customer that represented 10% or more of total trade receivables, which accounted for 12%. as of\nseptember\u00a027, 2014, the company had two customers that represented 10% or more of total trade receivables, one of which accounted for 16% and the other 13%. the company\u0092s

receivables from certain of its manufacturing vendors resulting from the sale of components to these vendors who manufacture\nsub-assemblies or assemble final products for the company. the company purchases these components directly from suppliers. vendor non-trade receivables from three of the company\u0092s vendors accounted for 38%, 18% and 14% of total vendor non-trade\nreceivables as of

there was not at least a reasonable possibility the company may have incurred a material loss, or a material loss in excess of a recorded accrual, with respect to loss contingencies for asserted legal and other claims. however, the\noutcome of litigation is inherently uncertain. therefore, although management considers the likelihood of such an outcome to be remote, if one or more of these legal matters were resolved against the company in a reporting period for amounts in\nexcess of management\u0092s expectations, the company\u0092s consolidated financial statements for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected.apple inc. v. samsung electronics co., ltd, et al.on\naugust\u00a024, 2012, a jury returned a verdict awarding the company $1.05 billion in its lawsuit against

decision of the district court. as a result, the court of appeals ordered entry of final judgment on damages in the amount of approximately $548 million, with the district court to determine supplemental damages and interest, as well as damages\nowed for products subject to the reversal in part. because\u00a0the ruling remains subject to further proceedings, the company has not recognized the award in its results of operations.note 11 \u0096 segment information and geographic datathe company reports segment information based on the \u0093management\u0094 approach. the management approach designates the internal\nreporting used by management for making decisions and assessing performance as the source of the company\u0092s reportable operating segments.the\ncompany manages its business primarily on a geographic basis. the company\u0092s reportable operating segments consist of the americas, europe, greater china, japan and rest of asia pacific. the americas segment includes both north and south\namerica. the europe segment includes european countries, as well as india, the middle east and africa. the greater china segment includes china, hong kong and taiwan. the rest of asia pacific segment includes australia and those asian countries not\nincluded in the company\u0092s other reportable operating segments. although each reportable operating segment provides similar hardware and software products and similar services, they are managed separately to better align with the location of the\ncompany\u0092s customers and distribution partners and the unique market dynamics of each geographic region. the accounting policies of the various segments are the same as those described in note 1, \u0093summary of significant accounting\npolicies.\u0094the company evaluates the performance of its reportable operating segments based on net sales and operating income. net sales for\ngeographic segments are generally based on the location of customers and sales through the company\u0092s retail stores located in those geographic locations. operating income for each segment includes net sales to third parties, related cost of\nsales and operating expenses directly attributable to the segment. advertising expenses are generally included in the geographic segment in which the expenditures are incurred. operating income for each segment excludes other income and expense and\ncertain expenses managed outside the reportable operating segments. costs excluded from segment operating income include various corporate expenses such as r&d, corporate marketing expenses, certain share-based compensation expenses, income\ntaxes, various nonrecurring charges and other separately managed general and administrative costs. the company does not include intercompany transfers between segments for management reporting purposes.apple inc. | 2015 form 10-k | 66"}, "28": {"tables": {"0": [["2015", "2014", "2013", "Americas"], ["Net sales", "93864",

reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2)\u00a0provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as\nnecessary to

company\u0092s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect
