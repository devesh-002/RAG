            "text": "to remain competitive and stimulate customer demand, the company must successfully manage\nfrequent product introductions and transitions.due to the highly volatile and competitive nature of the industries in which the company\ncompetes, the company must continually introduce new products, services and technologies, enhance existing products and services, and effectively stimulate customer demand for new and upgraded products. the success of new product introductions\ndepends on a number of factors including, but not limited to, timely and successful product development, market acceptance, the company\u0092s ability to manage the risks associated with new product production ramp-up issues, the availability of\napplication software for new products, the effective management of purchase commitments and inventory levels in line with anticipated product demand, the availability of products in appropriate quantities and at expected costs to meet anticipated\ndemand, and the risk that new products may have quality or other defects or deficiencies in the early stages of introduction. accordingly, the company cannot determine in advance the ultimate effect of new product introductions and transitions.the company depends on the performance of distributors, carriers and other resellers.the company distributes its products through cellular network carriers, wholesalers, national and regional retailers, and value-added resellers, many of\nwhom distribute products from competing manufacturers. the company also sells its products and third-party products in most of its major markets directly to education, enterprise and government customers, and consumers and small and mid-sized\nbusinesses through its online and retail stores.carriers providing cellular network service for iphone typically subsidize users\u0092 purchases of\nthe device. there is no assurance that such subsidies will be continued at all or in the same amounts upon renewal of the company\u0092s agreements with these carriers or in agreements the company enters into with new carriers.many resellers have narrow operating margins and have been adversely affected in the past by weak economic conditions. some resellers have perceived the\nexpansion of the company\u0092s direct sales as conflicting with their business interests as distributors and resellers of the company\u0092s products. such a perception could discourage resellers from investing resources in the distribution and\nsale of the company\u0092s products or lead them to limit or cease distribution of those products. the company has invested and will continue to invest in programs to enhance reseller sales, including staffing selected resellers\u0092 stores with\ncompany employees and contractors, and improving product placement displays. these programs could require a substantial investment while providing no assurance of return or incremental revenue. the financial condition of these resellers could\nweaken, these resellers could stop distributing the company\u0092s products, or uncertainty regarding demand for the company\u0092s products could cause resellers to reduce their ordering and marketing of the company\u0092s products.the company faces substantial inventory and other asset risk in addition to purchase commitment cancellation risk.the company records a write-down for product and component inventories that have become obsolete or exceed anticipated demand or net realizable value and\naccrues necessary cancellation fee reserves for orders of excess products and components. the company also reviews its long-lived assets, including capital assets held at its suppliers\u0092 facilities and inventory prepayments, for impairment\nwhenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. if the company determines that impairment has occurred, it records a write-down equal to the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds\nits fair value. although the company believes its provisions related to inventory, capital assets, inventory prepayments and other assets and purchase commitments are currently adequate, no assurance can be given that the company will not incur\nadditional related charges given the rapid and unpredictable pace of product obsolescence in the industries in which the company competes.the\ncompany must order components for its products and build inventory in advance of product announcements and shipments. consistent with industry practice, components are normally acquired through a combination of purchase orders, supplier contracts\nand open orders, in each case based on projected demand. where appropriate,\u00a0the\u00a0purchases are applied to\u00a0inventory component prepayments\u00a0that are\u00a0outstanding with the\u00a0respective supplier. purchase commitments typically\ncover forecasted component and manufacturing requirements for periods up to 150 days. because the company\u0092s markets are volatile, competitive and subject to rapid technology and price changes, there is a risk the company will forecast\nincorrectly and order or produce excess or insufficient amounts of components or products, or not fully utilize firm purchase commitments.apple inc. | 2014 form 10-k | 11"

            "text": "future operating results depend upon the company\u0092s ability to obtain components in\nsufficient quantities.because the company currently obtains components from single or limited sources, the company is subject to significant\nsupply and pricing risks. many components, including those that are available from multiple sources, are at times subject to industry-wide shortages and significant commodity pricing fluctuations. while the company has entered into agreements for\nthe supply of many components, there can be no assurance that the company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms, or at all. a number of suppliers of components may suffer from poor financial conditions, which can lead to\nbusiness failure for the supplier or consolidation within a particular industry, further limiting the company\u0092s ability to obtain sufficient quantities of components. the follow-on effects from global economic conditions on\u00a0the\ncompany\u0092s suppliers, described in \u0093global and regional economic conditions could materially adversely affect the company\u0094 above, also could affect the company\u0092s ability to obtain components. therefore, the company\nremains subject to significant risks of supply shortages and price increases.the company and other participants in the markets for mobile\ncommunication and media devices and personal computers also compete for various components with other industries that have experienced increased demand for their products. the company uses some custom components that are not common to the rest of\nthese industries. the company\u0092s new products often utilize custom components available from only one source. when a component or product uses new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers\u0092 yields have matured\nor manufacturing capacity has increased. continued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at all, may be affected if those suppliers decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to\nmeet the company\u0092s requirements. the supply of components for a new or existing product could be delayed or constrained, or a key manufacturing vendor could delay shipments of completed products to the company.the company depends on component and product manufacturing and logistical services provided by outsourcing partners, many of whom are\nlocated outside of the u.s.substantially all of the company\u0092s manufacturing is performed in whole or in part by a few outsourcing\npartners located primarily in asia. the company has also outsourced much of its transportation and logistics management. while these arrangements may lower operating costs, they also reduce the company\u0092s direct control over production and\ndistribution. it is uncertain what effect such diminished control will have on the quality or quantity of products or services, or the company\u0092s flexibility to respond to changing conditions. although arrangements with these partners may\ncontain provisions for warranty expense reimbursement, the company may remain responsible to the consumer for warranty service in the event of product defects and could experience an unanticipated product defect or warranty liability. while the\ncompany relies on its partners to adhere to its supplier code of conduct, material violations of the supplier code of conduct could occur.the\ncompany relies on sole-sourced outsourcing partners in the u.s., asia and europe to supply and manufacture many critical components, and on outsourcing partners primarily located in asia, for final assembly of substantially all of the company\u0092s\nhardware products. any failure of these partners to perform may have a negative impact on the company\u0092s cost or supply of components or finished goods. in addition, manufacturing or logistics in these locations or transit to final destinations\nmay be disrupted for a variety of reasons including, but not limited to, natural and man-made disasters, information technology system failures, commercial disputes, military actions or economic, business, labor, environmental, public health, or\npolitical issues.the company has invested in manufacturing process equipment, much of which is held at certain of its outsourcing partners, and has\nmade prepayments to certain of its suppliers associated with long-term supply agreements. while these arrangements help ensure the supply of components and finished goods, if these outsourcing partners or suppliers experience severe financial\nproblems or other disruptions in their business, the net realizable value of these assets could be negatively impacted.the\ncompany\u0092s products and services may experience quality problems from time to time that can result in decreased sales and operating margin and harm to the company\u0092s reputation.the company sells complex hardware and software products and services that can contain design and manufacturing defects. sophisticated operating system\nsoftware and applications, such as those sold by the company, often contain \u0093bugs\u0094 that can unexpectedly interfere with the software\u0092s intended operation. the company\u0092s online services may from time to time experience outages,\nservice slowdowns, or errors. defects may also occur in components and products the company purchases from third parties. there can be no assurance the company will be able to detect and fix all defects in the hardware, software and services it\nsells. failure to do so could result in lost revenue, significant warranty and other expenses and harm to the company\u0092s reputation.apple inc. | 2014 form 10-k | 12"

failure to obtain the right to make available third-party digital\ncontent, or to make available such content on commercially reasonable terms, could have a material adverse impact on the

software applications and services cease to be developed and maintained for the company\u0092s products, customers may choose not to buy the company\u0092s products.with respect to its mac products, the company believes the availability of third-party software applications and\nservices depends in part on the developers\u0092 perception and analysis of the relative benefits of developing, maintaining and upgrading such software for the company\u0092s products compared to windows-based products. this analysis may be based\non factors such as the market position of the company and its products, the anticipated revenue that may be generated, expected future growth of mac sales and the costs of developing such applications and services. if the company\u0092s minority\nshare of the global personal computer market causes developers to question the mac\u0092s prospects, developers could be less inclined to develop or upgrade software for the company\u0092s mac products and more inclined to devote their resources to\ndeveloping and upgrading software for the larger windows market.with respect to ios devices, the company relies on the continued availability and\ndevelopment of compelling and innovative software applications, which are distributed through a single distribution channel, the app store. ios devices are subject to rapid technological change, and, if third-party developers are unable to or choose\nnot to keep up with this pace of change, third-party applications might not successfully operate and may result in dissatisfied customers. as with applications for the company\u0092s mac products, the availability and development of these\napplications also depend on developers\u0092 perceptions and analysis of the relative benefits of developing software for the company\u0092s ios devices rather than its competitors\u0092 platforms, such as android. if developers focus their efforts\non these competing platforms, the availability and quality of applications for the company\u0092s ios devices may suffer.the company\nrelies on access to third-party intellectual property, which may not be available to the company on commercially reasonable

company believes such licenses generally can be obtained on reasonable terms. there is, however, no assurance that the necessary licenses can be obtained on acceptable terms or at all. failure to obtain the right to use\nthird-party intellectual property, or to use such intellectual property on commercially reasonable terms, could preclude the company from selling certain products or otherwise

            "text": "the company expects its quarterly revenue and operating results to fluctuate.the company\u0092s profit margins vary across its products and distribution channels. the company\u0092s software, accessories, and service and support\ncontracts generally have higher gross margins than certain of the company\u0092s other products. gross margins on the company\u0092s hardware products vary across product lines and can change over time as a result of product transitions, pricing and\nconfiguration changes, and component, warranty, and other cost fluctuations. the company\u0092s direct sales generally have higher associated gross margins than its indirect sales through its channel partners. in addition, the company\u0092s gross\nmargin and operating margin percentages, as well as overall profitability, may be materially adversely impacted as a result of a shift in product, geographic or channel mix, component cost increases, the strengthening u.s. dollar, price competition,\nor the introduction of new products, including those that have higher cost structures with flat or reduced pricing.the company has typically\nexperienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters due in part to seasonal holiday demand. additionally, new product introductions can significantly impact net sales, product costs and operating expenses. the company could\nbe subject to unexpected developments late in a quarter, such as lower-than-anticipated demand for the company\u0092s products, issues with new product introductions, an internal systems failure, or failure of one of the company\u0092s logistics,\ncomponents supply, or manufacturing partners.the company\u0092s stock price is subject to volatility.the company\u0092s stock price has experienced substantial price volatility in the past and may continue to do so in the future. additionally, the\ncompany, the technology industry and the stock market as a whole have experienced extreme stock price and volume fluctuations that have affected stock prices in ways that may have been unrelated to these companies\u0092 operating performance. price\nvolatility over a given period may cause the average price at which the company repurchases its own stock to exceed the stock\u0092s price at a given point in time. the company believes its stock price reflects expectations of future growth and\nprofitability. the company also believes its stock price reflects expectations that its cash dividend will continue at current levels or grow and that its current share repurchase program will be fully consummated. future dividends are subject to\ndeclaration by the company\u0092s board of directors, and the company\u0092s share repurchase program does not obligate it to acquire any specific number of shares. if the company fails to meet any of these expectations related to future growth,\nprofitability, dividends, share repurchases or other market expectations, its stock price may decline significantly, which could have a material adverse impact on investor confidence and employee retention.the company\u0092s financial performance is subject to risks associated with changes in the value of the u.s. dollar versus local\ncurrencies.the company\u0092s primary exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates relates to non-u.s. dollar denominated sales\nand operating expenses worldwide. weakening of foreign currencies relative to the u.s. dollar adversely affects the u.s. dollar value of the company\u0092s foreign currency-denominated sales and earnings, and generally leads the company to raise\ninternational pricing, potentially reducing demand for the company\u0092s products. margins on sales of the company\u0092s products in foreign countries and on sales of products that include components obtained from foreign suppliers, could be\nmaterially adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. in some circumstances, for competitive or other reasons, the company may decide not to raise local prices to fully offset the dollar\u0092s strengthening, or at all, which\nwould adversely affect the u.s. dollar value of the company\u0092s foreign currency denominated sales and earnings. conversely, a strengthening of foreign currencies relative to the u.s. dollar, while generally beneficial to the company\u0092s\nforeign currency-denominated sales and earnings, could cause the company to reduce international pricing and incur losses on its foreign currency derivative instruments, thereby limiting the benefit. additionally, strengthening of foreign currencies\nmay also increase the company\u0092s cost of product components denominated in those currencies, thus adversely affecting gross margins.the company\nuses derivative instruments, such as foreign currency forward and option contracts, to hedge certain exposures to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. the use of such hedging activities may not offset any, or more than a portion, of the\nadverse financial effects of unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates over the limited time the hedges are in place.apple inc. | 2014 form 10-k | 18"

(\u0093gaap\u0094) and\nthe company\u0092s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and operating results require the company\u0092s management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported in its consolidated financial statements\nand accompanying notes. note 1, \u0093summary of significant accounting policies\u0094 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in part ii, item\u00a08 of this form\u00a010-k describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in\nthe preparation of the company\u0092s consolidated financial statements. management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the\nbasis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. actual results may differ from these estimates and such differences may be material.management believes the company\u0092s critical accounting policies and estimates are those related to revenue recognition, valuation and impairment of\nmarketable securities, inventory valuation and valuation of manufacturing-related assets and estimated purchase commitment cancellation fees, warranty costs, income taxes and legal and other contingencies. management considers these policies\ncritical because they are both important to the portrayal of the company\u0092s financial condition and operating results, and they require management to make judgments and estimates about inherently uncertain matters. the company\u0092s senior\nmanagement has reviewed these critical accounting policies and related disclosures with the audit and finance committee of the company\u0092s board of directors.revenue recognitionnet sales consist primarily of revenue\nfrom the sale of hardware, software, digital content and applications, accessories, and service and support contracts. the company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the sales price is fixed\nor determinable and collection is probable. product is considered delivered to the customer once it has been shipped and title, risk of loss and rewards of ownership have been transferred. for most of the company\u0092s product sales, these criteria\nare met at the time the product is shipped. for online sales to individuals, for some sales to education customers in the u.s., and for certain other sales, the company defers revenue until the customer receives the product because the company\nretains a portion of the risk of loss on these sales during transit. the company recognizes revenue from the sale of hardware products, software bundled with hardware that is essential to the functionality of the hardware and third-party digital\ncontent sold on the itunes store in accordance with general revenue recognition accounting guidance. the company recognizes revenue in accordance with industry specific software accounting guidance for the following types of sales transactions:\n(i)\u00a0standalone sales of software products, (ii)\u00a0sales of software upgrades and (iii)\u00a0sales of software bundled with hardware not essential to the functionality of the hardware.for multi-element arrangements that include hardware products containing software essential to the hardware product\u0092s functionality, undelivered\nsoftware elements that relate to the hardware product\u0092s essential software and/or undelivered non-software services, the company allocates revenue to all deliverables based on their relative selling prices. in such circumstances, the company\nuses a hierarchy to determine the selling price to be used for allocating revenue to deliverables: (i)\u00a0vendor-specific objective evidence of fair value (\u0093vsoe\u0094), (ii)\u00a0third-party evidence of selling price (\u0093tpe\u0094) and\n(iii)\u00a0best estimate of selling price (\u0093esp\u0094). vsoe generally exists only when the company sells the deliverable separately and is the price actually charged by the company for that deliverable. esps reflect the company\u0092s best\nestimates of what the selling prices of elements would be if they were sold regularly on a stand-alone basis.for sales of qualifying versions of\nios devices, mac and apple tv, the company has indicated it may from time to time provide future unspecified software upgrades and features free of charge to customers. the company also provides various non-software services to owners of qualifying\nversions of ios devices and mac. because the company has neither vsoe nor tpe for the unspecified software upgrade rights or the non-software services, revenue is allocated to these rights and services based on the company\u0092s esps. revenue\nallocated to the unspecified software upgrade rights and non-software services based on the company\u0092s esps is deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis over the estimated period

and the company\u0092s intent to sell, or whether it will more likely than not be required to sell, the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis. the company\u0092s\nassessment on whether a security is other-than-temporarily impaired could change in the future due to new developments or changes in assumptions related to any particular security.inventory valuation and valuation of manufacturing-related assets and estimated purchase commitment cancellation feesthe company must order components for its products and build inventory in advance of product shipments and has invested in manufacturing process\nequipment, including capital assets held at its suppliers\u0092 facilities. in addition, the company has made prepayments to certain of its suppliers associated with long-term supply agreements to secure supply of inventory components. the company\nrecords a write-down for inventories of components and products, including third-party products held for resale, which have become obsolete or are in excess of anticipated demand or net realizable value. the company performs a detailed review of\ninventory that considers multiple factors including demand forecasts, product life cycle status, product development plans, current sales levels and component cost trends. the company also reviews its manufacturing-related capital assets and\ninventory prepayments for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. if the company determines that an asset is not recoverable, it records an impairment loss equal to the amount\nby which the carrying value of such an asset exceeds its fair value.apple inc. | 2014 form 10-k | 40"

to\u00a0inventory component prepayments that are outstanding with the\u00a0respective supplier. purchase commitments typically cover the company\u0092s\nforecasted component and manufacturing

time the related revenue is recognized based on historical and projected warranty claim\nrates, historical and projected cost-per-claim and knowledge of specific product failures that are outside of the company\u0092s typical experience. each quarter, the company re-evaluates these estimates to assess the adequacy of its recorded\nwarranty liabilities considering the size of the installed base of products subject to warranty protection and adjusts the amounts as necessary. if actual product failure rates or repair costs differ from estimates, revisions to the estimated\nwarranty liabilities would be required and could materially affect the company\u0092s results of operations.income taxesthe company records a tax provision for the anticipated tax consequences of the reported results of operations. the provision for income taxes is computed\nusing the asset and liability method, under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, and for\noperating losses and tax credit carryforwards. deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in effect for the years in which those tax assets are expected to be realized or\nsettled. the company records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is believed more likely than not to be realized.the company recognizes tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on\nexamination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood\nof being realized upon ultimate settlement.management believes it is more likely than not that forecasted income, including income that may be\ngenerated as a result of certain tax planning strategies, together with future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, will be sufficient to fully recover the deferred tax assets. in the event that the company determines all or part of\nthe net deferred tax assets are not realizable in the future, the company will make an adjustment to the valuation allowance that would be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made. in addition, the calculation of tax liabilities\ninvolves significant judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of gaap and complex tax laws. resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with management\u0092s expectations could have a material impact on\nthe company\u0092s financial condition and operating results.apple inc. | 2014 form 10-k | 41"

products, retains related inventory risk for physical products, is the primary obligor to the customer and assumes the credit risk for amounts billed to its customers. for\nthird-party applications sold through the app store and mac app store and certain digital content sold through the itunes store, the company does not determine the selling price of the products and is not the primary obligor to the customer.\ntherefore, the company accounts for such sales on a net basis by recognizing in net sales only the commission it retains from each sale. the portion of the gross amount billed to customers that is remitted by the company to third-party app\ndevelopers and certain digital content owners is not reflected in the company\u0092s consolidated statements of operations.the company records\ndeferred revenue when it receives payments in advance of the delivery of products or the performance of services. this includes amounts that have been deferred for unspecified and specified software upgrade rights and non-software services that are\nattached to hardware and software products. the company sells gift cards redeemable at its retail and online stores, and also sells gift cards redeemable on the itunes store for the purchase of digital content and software. the company records\ndeferred revenue upon the sale of the card, which is relieved upon redemption of the card by the customer. revenue from applecare service and support contracts is deferred and recognized over the service coverage periods. applecare service and\nsupport contracts typically include extended phone support, repair services, web-based support resources and diagnostic tools offered under the company\u0092s standard limited warranty.the company records reductions to revenue for estimated commitments related to price protection and other customer incentive programs. for transactions\ninvolving price protection, the company recognizes revenue net of the estimated amount to be refunded. for the company\u0092s other customer incentive programs, the estimated cost of these programs is recognized at the later of the date at which the\ncompany has sold the product or the date at which the program is offered. the company also records reductions to revenue for expected future product returns based on the company\u0092s historical experience. revenue is recorded net of

recognition for arrangements with multiple deliverablesfor multi-element arrangements that include hardware products containing software essential to the hardware product\u0092s functionality, undelivered\nsoftware elements that relate to the hardware product\u0092s essential software, and undelivered non-software services, the company allocates revenue to all deliverables based on their relative selling prices. in such circumstances, the company uses\na hierarchy to determine the selling price to be used for allocating revenue to deliverables: (i)\u00a0vendor-specific objective evidence of fair value (\u0093vsoe\u0094), (ii)\u00a0third-party evidence of selling price (\u0093tpe\u0094) and\n(iii)\u00a0best estimate of selling price (\u0093esp\u0094). vsoe generally exists only when the company sells the deliverable separately and is the price actually charged by the company for that deliverable. esps reflect the company\u0092s best\nestimates of what the selling prices of elements would be if they were sold regularly on a stand-alone basis. for multi-element arrangements accounted for in accordance with industry specific software accounting guidance, the company allocates\nrevenue to all deliverables based on the vsoe of each element, and if vsoe does not exist revenue is recognized when elements lacking vsoe are delivered.for sales of qualifying versions of iphone, ipad and ipod touch (\u0093ios devices\u0094), mac and apple tv, the company has indicated it may from time\nto time provide future unspecified software upgrades and features to the essential

applications. the company also provides various non-software services to owners of qualifying versions of ios devices and mac. the company has identified up to three deliverables regularly included in arrangements\ninvolving the sale of these devices. the first deliverable is the hardware and software essential to the functionality of the hardware device delivered at the time of sale. the second deliverable is the embedded right included with the purchase of\nios devices, mac and apple tv to receive on a when-and-if-available basis, future unspecified software upgrades and features relating to the product\u0092s essential software. the third deliverable is the non-software services to be provided to\nqualifying versions of ios devices and mac. the company allocates revenue between these deliverables using the relative selling price method. because the company has neither vsoe nor tpe for these deliverables, the allocation of revenue is based on\nthe company\u0092s esps. revenue allocated to the delivered hardware and the related essential software is recognized at the time of sale provided the other conditions for revenue recognition have been met. revenue allocated to the

            "text": "derivative financial instrumentsthe company uses derivatives to partially offset its business exposure to foreign currency and interest rate risk. the company may enter into forward\ncontracts, option contracts, swaps, or other derivative instruments to offset some of the risk on expected future cash flows, on net investments in certain foreign subsidiaries and on certain existing assets and liabilities. however, the company may\nchoose not to hedge certain exposures for a variety of reasons including, but not limited to, accounting considerations and the prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures. there can be no assurance the hedges will offset more than a\nportion of the financial impact resulting from movements in foreign currency exchange or interest rates.to help protect gross margins from\nfluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, certain of the company\u0092s subsidiaries whose functional currency is the u.s. dollar hedge a portion of forecasted foreign currency revenue. the company\u0092s subsidiaries whose functional\ncurrency is not the u.s. dollar and who sell in local currencies may hedge a portion of forecasted inventory purchases not denominated in the subsidiaries\u0092 functional currencies. the company typically hedges portions of its forecasted foreign\ncurrency exposure associated with revenue and inventory purchases, typically for up to 12 months.to help protect the net investment in a foreign\noperation from adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates, the company may enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts to offset the changes in the carrying amounts of these investments due to fluctuations in foreign currency\nexchange rates.the company may also enter into foreign currency forward contracts and option contracts to partially offset the foreign currency\nexchange gains and losses generated by the re-measurement of certain assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies.the company\nmay enter into interest rate swaps, options, or other instruments to manage interest rate risk. these instruments may offset a portion of changes in income or expense, or changes in fair value of the company\u0092s long-term debt or investments.the company records all derivatives in the consolidated balance sheets at fair value. the company\u0092s accounting treatment for these instruments\nis based on the hedge designation. the effective portions of cash flow hedges are recorded in aoci until the hedged item is recognized in earnings. gains and losses related to changes in fair value hedges are recognized in earnings along with a\ncorresponding loss or gain related to the change in value of the underlying hedged item. the effective portions of net investment hedges are recorded in other comprehensive income (\u0093oci\u0094) as a part of the cumulative translation adjustment.\nthe ineffective portions of cash flow hedges and net investment hedges are recorded in other income and expense. derivatives that are not designated as hedging instruments are adjusted to fair value through earnings in the financial statement line\nitem to which the derivative relates.deferred gains and losses associated with cash flow hedges of foreign currency revenue are recognized as a\ncomponent of net sales in the same period as the related revenue is recognized, and deferred gains and losses related to cash flow hedges of inventory purchases are recognized as a component of cost of sales in the same period as the related costs\nare recognized. deferred gains and losses associated with cash flow hedges of interest income or expense are recognized as a component of other income/(expense), net in the same period as the related income or expense is recognized. the\ncompany\u0092s foreign currency and interest rate transactions hedged with cash flow hedges as of september\u00a027, 2014 are expected to occur within 12 months and four years, respectively.derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges must be de-designated as hedges when it is probable the forecasted hedged transaction will not\noccur in the initially identified time period or within a subsequent two-month time period. deferred gains and losses in aoci associated with such derivative instruments are reclassified immediately into other income and expense. any subsequent\nchanges in fair value of such derivative instruments are reflected in other income and expense unless they are re-designated as hedges of other transactions. the company did not recognize any significant net gains or losses related to the loss of\nhedge designation on discontinued cash flow hedges during 2014, 2013 and 2012.the gain/loss recognized in other income and expense for foreign\ncurrency forward and option contracts not designated as hedging instruments was not significant during 2014, 2013 and 2012. these amounts represent the net gain or loss on the derivative contracts and do not include changes in the related exposures,\nwhich generally offset a portion of the gain or loss on the derivative contracts.apple
