industry, or significant financial service institution failures, there could be a new or incremental tightening in\nthe credit\u00a0markets, low liquidity, and\u00a0extreme volatility in fixed income, credit, currency, and equity markets. in addition, the risk remains that there\u00a0could be a number of follow-on effects from the credit crisis on\u00a0the\ncompany\u0092s business, including the insolvency of key outsourced manufacturing partners or suppliers or their inability to obtain credit to finance development and/or manufacture products resulting in\u00a0product delays; inability of

actual amounts realized in the\u00a0future on the company\u0092s financial instruments differing significantly\u00a0from the fair values currently assigned to them.uncertainty about current global economic conditions could also continue to increase the volatility of the company\u0092s stock price.global markets for the company\u0092s products and services are highly competitive and subject to rapid technological\nchange. if the company is unable to compete effectively in these markets, its financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected.the company competes in highly competitive global markets characterized by aggressive price cutting, with resulting downward pressure on gross margins, frequent introduction of new products, short product\nlife cycles, evolving industry standards, continual improvement in product price/performance characteristics, rapid adoption of technological and product advancements by competitors, and price sensitivity on the part of consumers.the company\u0092s ability to compete successfully depends heavily on its ability to ensure a continuing and timely introduction of\ninnovative new products and technologies to the marketplace. the company believes it is unique in that it designs and develops nearly the entire solution for its products, including the hardware, operating system, numerous software applications, and\nrelated services. as a result, the company must make significant investments in research and development and as such, the company currently holds a significant number of patents and copyrights and has registered and/or has applied to register\nnumerous patents, trademarks and service marks. by contrast, many of the company\u0092s competitors seek to compete primarily through aggressive pricing and very low cost structures. if the company is unable to continue to develop and sell\ninnovative new products with attractive margins or if other companies infringe on the company\u0092s intellectual property, the company\u0092s ability to maintain a competitive advantage could be negatively affected and its financial condition and\noperating results could be materially adversely affected.in the market for personal computers and peripherals, the company\nfaces a significant number of competitors, many of which have broader product lines, lower priced products, and larger installed customer bases. consolidation in this market has resulted in larger and potentially stronger competitors. price\ncompetition has been particularly intense as competitors selling windows-based personal computers have aggressively cut prices and lowered product margins. the company also faces increased competition in key market segments, including consumer, smb,\neducation, enterprise, government and creative markets. an increasing number of internet devices that include software applications and are smaller and simpler than traditional personal computers compete for market share with the company\u0092s\nexisting products.the company is currently the only authorized maker of hardware using the mac os. the mac os has a minority\nmarket share in the personal computer market, which is dominated by computer makers using competing operating systems, most notably windows. the company\u0092s financial condition and operating results depend substantially on the company\u0092s\nability to continually improve the mac platform to maintain functional and11"}, "1": {"tables": {}, "text": "design advantages. use of unauthorized copies of the mac os on other companies\u0092 hardware products may result in decreased demand for the company\u0092s hardware products, and could\nmaterially adversely affect the company\u0092s financial condition and operating results.the company currently markets\ncertain mobile communication and media devices, and third-party digital content and applications. the company faces substantial competition from companies that have significant technical, marketing, distribution and other resources, as well as\nestablished hardware, software and digital content supplier relationships. additionally, the company faces significant price competition as competitors reduce their selling prices and attempt to imitate the company\u0092s product features and\napplications within their own products or, alternatively, collaborate with each other to offer solutions that are more competitive than those they currently offer. the company also competes with illegitimate ways to obtain third-party digital\ncontent and applications. the company has only recently entered the mobile communications and media device markets, and many of its competitors in these markets have significantly greater experience, product breadth and distribution channels than\nthe company. because some current and potential competitors have substantial resources and/or experience and a lower cost structure, they may be able to provide such products and services at little or no profit or even at a loss. the company also\nexpects competition to intensify as competitors attempt to imitate the company\u0092s approach to providing these components seamlessly within their individual offerings or work collaboratively to offer integrated solutions.the company currently receives subsidies from its exclusive and non-exclusive carriers providing cellular network service for iphone.\nthere is no assurance that such subsidies will be continued at all or in the same amounts upon renewal of the company\u0092s agreements with these carriers or in agreements the company enters into with new carriers.there can be no assurance the company will be able to continue to provide products and services that compete effectively.to remain competitive and stimulate customer demand, the company must successfully manage frequent product introductions and\ntransitions.due to the highly volatile and competitive nature of the industries in which the company competes, the\ncompany must continually introduce new products, services and technologies, enhance existing products and services, and effectively stimulate customer demand for new and upgraded products. the success of new product introductions depends on a number\nof factors including but not limited to timely and successful product development, market acceptance, the company\u0092s ability to manage the risks associated with new products and production ramp issues, the availability of application software\nfor new products, the effective management of purchase commitments and inventory levels in line with anticipated product demand, the availability of products in appropriate quantities and costs to meet anticipated demand, and the risk that new\nproducts may have quality or other defects in the early stages of introduction. accordingly, the company cannot determine in advance the ultimate effect of new product introductions and transitions on its financial condition and operating results.the company faces substantial inventory and other asset risk in addition to purchase commitment cancellation risk.the company records a write-down for product and component inventories that have become obsolete or exceed anticipated\ndemand or net realizable value and accrues necessary cancellation fee reserves for orders of excess products and components. the company also reviews its long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changed circumstances indicate the carrying\namount of an asset may not be recoverable. if the company determines that impairment has occurred, it records a write-down equal to the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds its fair market value. although the company believes its\nprovisions related to inventory, other assets and purchase commitments are currently adequate, no assurance can be given that the company will not incur additional related charges given the rapid and unpredictable pace of product obsolescence in the\nindustries in which the company competes. such charges could materially adversely affect the company\u0092s financial condition and operating results.12"}, "2": {"tables": {}, "text": "the company must order\ncomponents for its products and build inventory in advance of product announcements and shipments. consistent with industry practice, components are normally acquired through a combination of purchase orders, supplier contracts, open orders and,\nwhere appropriate, prepayments, in each case based on projected demand. such purchase commitments typically cover forecasted component and manufacturing requirements for 30 to 150 days. because the company\u0092s markets are volatile, competitive\nand subject to rapid technology and price changes, there is a risk the company will forecast incorrectly and order or produce excess or insufficient inventories of components or products. the company\u0092s financial condition and operating results\nhave been in the past and could be in the future materially adversely affected by the company\u0092s ability to manage its inventory levels and respond to short-term shifts in customer demand patterns.future operating results depend upon the company\u0092s ability to obtain key components including but not limited to microprocessors,\nnand flash memory, dram and lcds at favorable prices and in sufficient quantities.because the company currently obtains\ncertain key components including but not limited to microprocessors, enclosures, certain lcds, certain optical drives, and asics, from single or limited sources, the company is subject to significant supply and pricing risks. many of these and other\nkey components that are available from multiple sources including but not limited to nand flash memory, dram and certain lcds, are subject at times to industry-wide shortages and significant commodity pricing fluctuations. the company has entered\ninto certain agreements for the supply of key components including but not limited to microprocessors, nand flash memory, dram and lcds at favorable pricing, but there is no guarantee that the company will be able to extend or renew these agreements\non similar favorable terms, or at all, upon expiration or otherwise obtain favorable pricing in the future. the follow-on effects from the credit crisis on\u00a0the company\u0092s key suppliers, referred to in \u0093economic conditions could\nmaterially adversely affect the company\u0094 above, which is incorporated herein by reference, also could affect the company\u0092s ability to obtain key components. therefore, the company remains subject to significant risks of supply\nshortages and/or price increases that could materially adversely affect the company\u0092s financial condition and operating results. the company expects to experience decreases in its gross margin percentage in future periods, as compared to levels\nachieved during 2010, largely due to a higher mix of new and innovative products that have higher cost structures and deliver greater value to customers, and expected and potential future component cost and other cost increases. for additional\ninformation refer to part ii, item\u00a07, \u0093management\u0092s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations,\u0094 under the subheading \u0093gross margin,\u0094 which is incorporated herein by reference.the company and other participants in the personal computer, and mobile communication and media device industries compete for various\ncomponents with other industries that have experienced increased demand for their products. the company uses some custom components that are not common to the rest of these industries. the company\u0092s new products often utilize custom components\navailable from only one source. when a component or product uses new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers\u0092 yields have matured or manufacturing capacity has increased. continued availability of these\ncomponents at acceptable prices, or at all, may be affected if those suppliers decided to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the company\u0092s requirements. if the supply of a key\nsingle-sourced component for a new or existing product were delayed or constrained, if such components were available only at significantly higher prices, or if a key manufacturing vendor delayed shipments of completed products to the company, the\ncompany\u0092s financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected.the company depends on\ncomponent and product manufacturing and logistical services provided by third parties, many of whom are located outside of the u.s.substantially all of the company\u0092s components and products are manufactured in whole or in part by a few third-party manufacturers. many of these manufacturers are located outside of the u.s., and\nare concentrated in several general locations. the company has also outsourced much of its transportation and logistics management. while these arrangements may lower operating costs, they also reduce the company\u0092s direct control over\nproduction and distribution. it is uncertain what effect such diminished control will have on the quality or quantity of13"}, "3": {"tables": {}, "text": "products or services, or the company\u0092s flexibility to respond to changing conditions. in addition, the company relies on third-party manufacturers to adhere to the company\u0092s supplier\ncode of conduct. although arrangements with such manufacturers may contain provisions for warranty expense reimbursement, the company may remain responsible to the consumer for warranty service in the event of product defects. any unanticipated\nproduct defect or warranty liability, whether pursuant to arrangements with contract manufacturers or otherwise, could materially adversely affect the company\u0092s reputation, financial condition and operating results.final assembly of the company\u0092s products is currently performed in the company\u0092s manufacturing facility in ireland, and by\nexternal vendors in california, texas, china, the czech republic and korea. currently, the supply and manufacture of many critical components is performed by sole-sourced third-party vendors in the u.s., china, germany, ireland, israel, japan,\nkorea, malaysia, the netherlands, the philippines, taiwan, thailand and singapore. sole-sourced third-party vendors in china perform final assembly of substantially all of the company\u0092s mac products, iphones, ipads and ipods. if manufacturing\nor logistics in these locations is disrupted

company on commercially reasonable terms or at all.the\ncompany contracts with certain third parties to offer their digital content through the company\u0092s itunes store. the company\u0092s licensing arrangements with these third parties are short-term and do not guarantee the continuation or renewal\nof these arrangements on reasonable terms, if at all. some third-party content providers currently or in the future may offer competing products and services, and could take action to make it more difficult or impossible for the company to license\ntheir content in the future. other content owners, providers or distributors may seek to limit the company\u0092s access to, or increase the total cost of, such content. if the company is unable to continue to offer a wide variety of content at\nreasonable prices with acceptable usage rules, or continue to expand its geographic reach, the company\u0092s financial condition and operating results may be materially adversely affected.many third-party content providers require that the company provide certain digital rights management (\u0093drm\u0094) and other\nsecurity solutions. if these requirements change, the company may have to develop or license new technology to provide these solutions. there is no assurance the company will be able to develop or license such solutions at a reasonable cost and in a\ntimely manner. in addition, certain countries have passed or may propose legislation that would force the company to license its drm, which could lessen the protection of content and subject it to piracy and also could affect arrangements with the\ncompany\u0092s content providers.the company relies on access to third-party patents and intellectual property, and the\ncompany\u0092s future results could be materially adversely affected if it is alleged or found to have infringed intellectual property rights.many of the company\u0092s products are designed to include third-party intellectual property, and in the future the company may need to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of its products\nand business methods. although the company believes that, based on past experience and industry practice, such licenses generally could be obtained on reasonable terms, there is no assurance that the necessary licenses would be available on\nacceptable terms or at all.because of technological changes in the industries in which the company competes, current\nextensive patent coverage, and the rapid issuance of new patents, it is possible that certain components of the company\u0092s products and business methods may unknowingly infringe the patents or other intellectual property rights of third parties.\nfrom time to time, the company has been notified that it may be infringing such rights. regardless of merit, responding to such claims can consume significant time and expense. at present, the company is vigorously defending a number of patent\ninfringement cases, and several pending claims are in various stages of evaluation. in certain cases, the company may consider the desirability of entering into licensing agreements, although

materially adversely affected.with the introduction of iphones and 3g enabled ipads, the company has begun to compete with mobile communication and media devices\ncompanies that hold significant patent portfolios.\u00a0regardless of the scope or validity of such patents or\u00a0the merits of any\u00a0potential patent claims by competitors, the company may have to engage in protracted litigation, enter into\nexpensive agreements or settlements and/or\u00a0modify its products. any of these events could have a material adverse impact on the company\u0092s financial condition and operating results.the company\u0092s future performance depends on support from third-party software developers. if third-party software applications\nand services cease to be developed and maintained for the company\u0092s products, customers may choose not to buy the company\u0092s products.the company believes decisions by customers to purchase its hardware products, including its macs, iphones, ipads and ipods, are often based to a certain extent on the availability of third-party software\napplications and services. there is no assurance that third-party developers will continue to develop and maintain applications and services for the company\u0092s products on a timely basis or at all, and discontinuance or delay of these\napplications and services could materially adversely affect the company\u0092s financial condition and operating results.with respect to its mac products, the company believes the availability of third-party software applications and services depends in part\non the developers\u0092 perception and analysis of the relative benefits of developing, maintaining, and upgrading such software for the company\u0092s products compared to windows-based products. this analysis may be based on factors such as the\nperceived strength of the company and its products, the anticipated revenue that may be generated, continued acceptance by customers of mac os x, and the costs of developing such applications and services. if the company\u0092s minority share of the\nglobal personal computer market causes developers to question the company\u0092s prospects, developers could be less inclined to develop or upgrade software for the company\u0092s products and more inclined to devote their resources to developing\nand upgrading software for the larger windows market. the company\u0092s development of its own software applications and services may also negatively affect the decisions of third-party developers, such as microsoft, adobe and google, to develop,\nmaintain, and upgrade similar or competitive software and services for the company\u0092s products.with respect to iphone,\nipad and ipod touch, the company relies on the continued availability and development of compelling and innovative software applications. unlike third-party software applications for mac products, the software applications for the iphone, ipad and\nipod touch platforms are distributed through a single distribution channel, the app store. the absence of multiple distribution channels, which are available for competing platforms, may limit the availability and acceptance of third-party\napplications by the company\u0092s customers, thereby causing developers to curtail significantly, or stop, development for the company\u0092s platforms. in addition, iphone, ipad and ipod touch are subject to rapid technological change, and, if\nthird-party developers are unable to keep up with this pace of change, third-party applications might not successfully operate and may result in dissatisfied customers. further, if the company develops its own software applications and services,\nsuch development may negatively affect the decisions of third-party developers to develop, maintain,15"}, "5": {"tables": {}, "text": "and upgrade similar or competitive applications for the iphone, ipad and ipod touch platforms. as with

platforms, the availability and quality of applications for the company\u0092s devices may suffer.the company\u0092s future operating performance depends on the performance of distributors, carriers and other resellers.the company distributes its products through wholesalers, resellers, national and regional retailers, value-added resellers, and cataloguers, many of whom distribute products from competing manufacturers.\nthe company also sells many of its products and resells third-party products in most of its major markets directly to customers, certain education customers, cellular network carriers\u0092 distribution channels and certain resellers through its\nonline and retail stores.many resellers operate on narrow operating margins and have been negatively affected in the past by\nweak economic conditions. some resellers have perceived the expansion of the company\u0092s direct sales as conflicting with their business interests as distributors and resellers of the company\u0092s products. such a perception could discourage\nresellers from investing resources in the distribution and sale of the company\u0092s products or lead them to limit or cease distribution of those products. the company\u0092s financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely\naffected if the financial condition of these resellers weakens, if resellers stopped distributing the company\u0092s products, or if uncertainty regarding demand for the company\u0092s products caused resellers to reduce their ordering and marketing\nof the company\u0092s products. the company has invested and will continue to invest in programs to enhance reseller sales, including staffing selected resellers\u0092 stores with company employees and contractors and improving product placement\ndisplays. these programs could require a substantial investment while providing no assurance of return or incremental revenue.the company\u0092s retail business has required and will continue to require a substantial investment and commitment of resources and\nis subject to numerous risks and uncertainties.the company\u0092s retail stores have required substantial fixed\ninvestment in equipment and leasehold improvements, information systems, inventory and personnel. the company also has entered into substantial operating lease commitments for retail space, with terms ranging from five to 20 years, the majority of\nwhich are for ten years. certain stores have been designed and built to serve as high-profile venues to promote brand awareness and serve as vehicles for corporate sales and marketing activities. because of their unique design elements, locations\nand size, these stores require substantially more investment than the company\u0092s more typical retail stores. due to the high fixed cost structure associated with the retail segment, a decline in sales or the closure or poor performance of\nindividual or multiple stores could result in significant lease termination costs, write-offs of equipment and leasehold improvements, and severance costs that could materially adversely affect the company\u0092s financial condition and operating\nresults.many factors unique to retail operations, some of which are beyond the company\u0092s control, pose risks and\nuncertainties that could materially adversely affect the company\u0092s financial condition and operating results. these risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, macro-economic factors that could have a negative effect on general\nretail activity, as well as the company\u0092s inability to manage costs associated with store construction and operation, inability to sell third-party products at adequate margins, failure to manage relationships with existing retail channel\npartners, more challenging environment in managing retail operations outside the u.s., costs associated with unanticipated fluctuations in the value of

future growth and profitability expectations. if the company fails to meet these expectations its stock price may significantly decline, which could have a material adverse impact on investor confidence and employee\nretention.the company\u0092s business is subject to the risks of international operations.the company derives a significant portion of its revenue and earnings from its international operations. compliance with u.s. and foreign\nlaws and regulations that apply to the company\u0092s international operations, including without limitation import and export requirements, anti-corruption laws, tax laws (including u.s. taxes on foreign subsidiaries), foreign exchange controls and\ncash repatriation restrictions, data privacy requirements, labor laws, and anti-competition regulations, increases the costs of doing business in foreign jurisdictions, and any such costs, which may rise in the future as a result of changes in these\nlaws and regulations or in their interpretation. furthermore, the company has implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these laws and regulations, but there can be no assurance that the company\u0092s employees,\ncontractors, or agents will not violate such laws and regulations or the company\u0092s policies. any such violations could individually or in the aggregate materially adversely affect the company\u0092s financial condition or operating results.the company\u0092s financial condition and operating results also could be significantly affected by other risks associated\nwith international activities, including but not limited to, economic and labor conditions, increased duties, taxes and other costs, political instability, and changes in the value of the u.s. dollar versus local currencies. margins on sales of the\ncompany\u0092s products in foreign countries, and on sales of products that include components obtained from foreign suppliers, could be materially adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and by international trade\nregulations, including duties, tariffs and antidumping penalties. additionally, the company is exposed to credit and collectability risk on its trade receivables with customers in certain international markets. there can be no assurance it can\neffectively limit its credit risk and avoid losses, which could materially adversely affect the company\u0092s financial condition and operating results.the company\u0092s primary exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates relate to non-u.s. dollar denominated sales in europe, japan, australia, canada and certain parts of asia, as well as\nnon-u.s. dollar denominated operating expenses incurred throughout the world. weakening of foreign currencies relative to the u.s. dollar will adversely affect the u.s. dollar value of the company\u0092s foreign currency-denominated sales and\nearnings, and generally will lead the company to raise international pricing, potentially reducing demand for the company\u0092s products. in some circumstances, due to competition or other reasons, the company may decide not to raise local prices\nto the full extent of the dollar\u0092s strengthening, or at all, which would adversely affect the u.s. dollar value of the company\u0092s foreign currency denominated sales and earnings. conversely, a strengthening of foreign currencies, while\ngenerally beneficial to the company\u0092s foreign currency-denominated sales and earnings, could cause the company to reduce international pricing and incur losses on its foreign currency derivative instruments, thereby limiting the benefit.\nadditionally, strengthening of foreign currencies may also increase the company\u0092s cost of product components denominated in those currencies, thus adversely affecting gross margins.the company has used derivative instruments, such as foreign currency forward and option contracts, to hedge certain exposures to\nfluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. the use of such hedging activities may not offset any or more than a portion of the adverse financial effects of unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates over the limited time the hedges are in\nplace.19"}, "9": {"tables": {}, "text": "the company is\nexposed to credit risk and fluctuations in

policies and methods used in the preparation of the company\u0092s consolidated financial statements.\nmanagement bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions it

marketable securities, inventory valuation and inventory purchase commitments, warranty costs, income taxes, and legal\nand other contingencies. management considers these policies critical because they are both important to the portrayal of the company\u0092s financial condition and operating results, and they require management to make judgments and estimates about\ninherently uncertain

the customer once it has been shipped and title and risk of loss have been transferred. for most of the company\u0092s product sales,\nthese criteria are met at the time the product is shipped. for online sales to individuals, for some sales to education customers in the u.s., and for certain other sales, the company defers recognition of revenue until the customer receives the\nproduct because the company retains a portion of the risk of loss on these sales during transit. the company recognizes revenue from the sale of hardware products (e.g., macs, iphones, ipads, ipods and peripherals), software bundled with hardware\nthat is28"}, "1": {"tables": {}, "text": "essential to the functionality of the hardware, and third-party digital content sold on the itunes store in accordance with general revenue recognition accounting guidance. the company recognizes\nrevenue in accordance with industry specific software accounting guidance for the following types of sales transactions: (i)\u00a0standalone sales of software products, (ii)\u00a0sales of software upgrades and (iii)\u00a0sales of software bundled\nwith hardware not essential to the functionality of the hardware.for multi-element arrangements that include tangible\nproducts containing software essential to the tangible product\u0092s functionality and undelivered software elements relating to the tangible product\u0092s essential software, the company allocates revenue to all deliverables based on their\nrelative selling prices. in such circumstances, the company uses a hierarchy to determine the selling price to be used for allocating revenue to deliverables: (i)\u00a0vendor-specific objective evidence of fair value (\u0093vsoe\u0094),\n(ii)\u00a0third-party evidence of selling price (\u0093tpe\u0094) and (iii)\u00a0best estimate of the selling price (\u0093esp\u0094). vsoe generally exists only when the company sells the deliverable separately and is the price actually charged by\nthe company for that deliverable. esps reflect the company\u0092s best estimates of what the selling prices of elements would be if they were sold regularly on a stand-alone basis.for all past and current sales of iphone, ipad, apple tv and for sales of ipod touch beginning in june 2010, the company indicated it\nmight from time-to-time provide future unspecified software upgrades and features free of charge to customers. the company has identified two deliverables in arrangements involving the sale of these devices. the first deliverable is the hardware and\nsoftware essential to the functionality of the hardware device delivered at the time of sale. the second deliverable is the embedded right included with the purchase of iphone, ipad, ipod touch and apple tv to receive on a when-and-if-available\nbasis, future unspecified software upgrades and features relating to the product\u0092s essential software. the company has allocated revenue between these two deliverables using the relative selling price method. because the company has neither\nvsoe nor tpe for the two deliverables, the allocation of revenue has been based on the company\u0092s esps. amounts allocated to the delivered hardware and the related essential software are recognized at the time of sale provided the other\nconditions for revenue recognition have been met. amounts allocated to the embedded unspecified software upgrade right are deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis over the 24-month estimated life of each of these devices. all product cost\nof sales, including estimated warranty costs, are recognized at the time of sale. costs for engineering and sales and marketing are expensed as incurred. if the estimated life of the hardware product should change, the future rate of amortization of\nthe revenue allocated to the software upgrade right will also change.the company\u0092s process for determining its esp for\ndeliverables without vsoe or tpe involves management\u0092s judgment. the company\u0092s process considers multiple factors that may vary depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each deliverable. the company believes its\ncustomers, particularly consumers, would be reluctant to buy unspecified software upgrade rights related to iphone, ipad, ipod touch and apple tv. this view is primarily based on the fact that unspecified upgrade rights do not obligate the company\nto provide upgrades at a particular time or at all, and do not specify to customers which upgrades or features will be delivered. therefore, the company has concluded if it were to sell upgrade rights on a standalone basis, including those rights\nassociated with iphone, ipad, ipod touch and apple tv, the selling price would be relatively low. key factors considered by the company in developing the esps for these upgrade rights include prices charged by the company for similar offerings, the\ncompany\u0092s historical pricing practices, the nature of the upgrade rights (e.g., unspecified and when-and-if-available), and the relative esp of the upgrade rights as compared to the total selling price of the product. the company may also\nconsider, when appropriate, the impact of other products and services, including advertising services, on selling price assumptions when developing and reviewing its esps for software upgrade rights and related deliverables. the company may also\nconsider additional factors as appropriate, including the pricing of competitive alternatives if they exist, and product-specific business objectives. if the facts and circumstances underlying the factors considered change or should future facts and\ncircumstances lead the company to consider additional factors, the company\u0092s esp for software upgrades related to future sales for these devices could change.29"}, "2": {"tables": {}, "text": "beginning in the third\nquarter of 2010 in conjunction with the announcement of ios 4,

revenue for estimated commitments related to price protection and for customer incentive programs, including reseller and end-user rebates, and other sales programs and volume-based incentives. for transactions involving price\nprotection, the company recognizes revenue net of the estimated amount to be refunded, provided the refund amount can be reasonably and reliably estimated and the other conditions for revenue recognition have been met. the company\u0092s policy\nrequires that, if refunds cannot be reliably estimated, revenue is not recognized until reliable estimates can be made or the price protection lapses. for customer incentive programs, the estimated cost of these programs is recognized at the later\nof the date at which the company has sold the product or the date at which the program is offered. the company also records reductions to revenue for expected future product returns based on the company\u0092s historical experience. future market\nconditions and product transitions may require the company to increase customer incentive programs and incur incremental price protection obligations that could result in additional reductions to revenue at the time such programs are offered.\nadditionally, certain customer incentive programs require management to estimate the number of customers who will actually redeem the incentive. management\u0092s estimates are based on historical experience and the specific terms and conditions of\nparticular incentive programs. if a greater than estimated proportion of customers redeem such incentives, the company would be required to record additional reductions to revenue, which would have a negative impact on the company\u0092s results of\noperations.valuation and impairment of marketable securitiesthe

income only when such investments are sold or an\nother-than-temporary impairment is recognized. realized gains and losses on the sale of securities are determined by specific identification of each security\u0092s cost basis. the company regularly reviews its investment portfolio to determine if\nany investment is other-than-temporarily impaired due to changes in credit risk or other potential valuation concerns, which would require the company to record an impairment charge in the period any such determination is made. in making this\njudgment, the company evaluates, among other things, the duration and extent to which the fair value of an investment is less than its cost, the financial condition of the issuer and any changes thereto, and the company\u0092s intent to sell, or\nwhether it is more likely than not it will be required to sell, the investment before recovery of the investment\u0092s amortized cost basis. the company\u0092s assessment on whether an investment is other-than-temporarily impaired or not, could\nchange in the future due to new developments or changes in assumptions related to any particular investment.inventory valuation and\ninventory purchase commitmentsthe company must order components for its products and build inventory in advance of\nproduct shipments. the company records a write-down for inventories of components and products, including third-party products held for resale, which have become obsolete or are in excess of anticipated demand or net realizable value. the company\nperforms a detailed review of inventory each fiscal quarter that considers multiple factors including demand forecasts, product life cycle status, product development plans, current sales levels, and component cost trends. the industries in which\nthe company competes are subject to a rapid and unpredictable pace of product and component obsolescence and demand changes. if future demand or market conditions for the company\u0092s products are less favorable than forecasted or if unforeseen\ntechnological changes negatively impact the utility of component inventory, the company may be required to record additional write-downs, which would negatively affect its results of operations in the period when the write-downs were recorded.30"}, "3": {"tables": {}, "text": "the company records\naccruals for estimated cancellation fees related to component orders that have been cancelled or are expected to be cancelled. consistent with industry practice, the company acquires components through a combination of purchase orders, supplier\ncontracts, and open orders based on projected demand information. these commitments typically cover the company\u0092s requirements for periods ranging from 30 to 150 days. if there is an abrupt and substantial decline in demand for one or more of\nthe company\u0092s products or an unanticipated change in technological requirements for any of the company\u0092s products, the company may be required to record additional accruals for cancellation fees that would negatively affect its results of\noperations in the period when the cancellation fees are identified and recorded.warranty coststhe company provides for the estimated cost of hardware and software warranties at the time the related revenue is recognized based on\nhistorical and projected warranty claim rates, historical and projected cost-per-claim, and knowledge of specific product failures that are outside of the company\u0092s typical experience. each quarter, the company reevaluates its estimates to\nassess the adequacy of its recorded warranty liabilities considering the size of the installed base of products subject to warranty protection and adjusts the amounts as necessary. if actual product failure rates or repair costs differ from\nestimates, revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required and could materially affect the company\u0092s results of operations.the company periodically provides updates to its applications and operating system software to maintain the software\u0092s compliance with specifications. the estimated cost to develop such updates is\naccounted for as warranty cost that is recognized at the time related software revenue is recognized. factors considered in determining appropriate accruals related to such updates include the number of units delivered, the number of updates\nexpected to occur, and the historical cost and estimated future cost of the resources necessary to develop these updates.income taxesthe company records a tax provision for the anticipated tax consequences of the reported results of operations. in\naccordance with gaap, the provision for income taxes is computed using the asset and liability method, under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the\nfinancial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in effect for the\nyears in which those tax assets are expected to be realized or settled. the company records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is believed more likely than not to be realized.the company only recognizes the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be\nsustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50%\nlikelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement.management believes it is more likely than not that forecasted income,\nincluding income that may be generated as a result of certain tax planning strategies, together with future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, will be sufficient to fully recover the deferred tax assets. in the event that the\ncompany determines all or part of the net deferred tax assets are not realizable in the future, the company will make an adjustment to the valuation allowance that would be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made. in addition,\nthe calculation of tax liabilities involves significant judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of gaap and complex tax laws. resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with management\u0092s\nexpectations could have a material impact on the company\u0092s financial condition and operating

to perform final assembly and test of finished products. these contract manufacturers acquire components and build product based on demand information supplied by the company, which typically covers periods\nranging from 30 to 150 days. the company also obtains individual components for its products from a wide variety of individual suppliers. consistent with industry practice, the company acquires components through a combination of purchase orders,\nsupplier contracts, and open orders based on projected demand information.41"}}, "Item 7A": {"0": {"tables": {}, "text": "movements in either foreign exchange or interest rates. in addition, the timing of the accounting for recognition of gains and losses related to mark-to-market instruments for any given period\nmay not coincide with the timing of gains and losses related to the underlying economic exposures and, therefore, may adversely affect the company\u0092s financial condition and operating results.interest rate riskwhile the company is exposed to interest rate fluctuations in many of the world\u0092s leading industrialized countries, the\ncompany\u0092s interest income and expense is most sensitive to fluctuations in the general level of u.s. interest rates. as such, changes in u.s. interest rates affect the interest earned on the company\u0092s cash, cash equivalents and marketable\nsecurities, the fair value of those investments, as well as costs associated with foreign currency hedges.the company\u0092s\ninvestment policy and strategy are focused on preservation of capital and supporting the liquidity requirements of the company. a portion of the company\u0092s cash is managed by external managers within the guidelines of the company\u0092s\ninvestment policy and to objective market benchmarks. the company\u0092s internal portfolio is benchmarked against external manager performance.the company\u0092s exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the company\u0092s investment portfolio. the company typically invests in highly rated securities and its\npolicy generally limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. the company\u0092s investment policy requires investments to be investment grade, primarily rated single-a or better, with the objective of minimizing the potential risk of\nprincipal loss. all highly liquid investments with initial maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase are classified as cash equivalents. the company classifies its marketable securities as either short-term or long-term based on\neach instrument\u0092s underlying contractual maturity date. all short-term marketable securities have maturities less than 12 months, while all long-term marketable securities have maturities ranging from one to five years. the company may sell its\ninvestments prior to their stated maturities for strategic purposes, in anticipation of credit deterioration, or for duration management. the company recognized no significant net gains or losses during 2010, 2009 and 2008 related to such sales.to provide a meaningful assessment of the interest rate risk associated with the company\u0092s investment portfolio, the\ncompany performed a sensitivity analysis to determine the impact a change in interest rates would have on the value of the investment portfolio assuming a 100 basis point parallel shift in the yield curve. based on investment positions as of\nseptember\u00a025, 2010, a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates across all maturities would result in a $477 million incremental decline in the fair market value of the portfolio. as of september\u00a026, 2009, a similar 100 basis\npoint shift in the yield curve would have resulted in a $176 million incremental decline in the fair market value of the portfolio. such losses would only be realized if the company sold the investments prior to maturity.foreign currency riskin general, the company is a net receiver of currencies other than the u.s. dollar. accordingly, changes in exchange rates, and in\nparticular a strengthening of the u.s. dollar, will negatively affect the company\u0092s net sales and gross margins as expressed in u.s. dollars. there is also a risk that the company will have to adjust local currency product pricing due to\ncompetitive pressures when there has been significant volatility in foreign currency exchange rates.the company may enter\ninto foreign currency forward and option contracts with financial institutions to protect against foreign exchange risks associated with certain existing assets and liabilities, certain firmly committed transactions, forecasted future cash flows,\nand net investments in foreign subsidiaries. generally, the company\u0092s practice is to hedge a majority of its material foreign exchange exposures, typically for three to six months.43"}, "1": {"tables": {}, "text": "however, the company may choose not to hedge certain foreign exchange exposures for a variety of reasons, including but not limited to immateriality, accounting considerations and the prohibitive\neconomic cost of hedging particular exposures.to provide a meaningful assessment of the foreign currency risk associated\nwith certain of the company\u0092s foreign currency derivative positions, the company performed a sensitivity analysis using a value-at-risk (\u0093var\u0094) model to assess the potential impact of fluctuations in exchange rates. the var model\nconsisted of using a monte carlo simulation to generate thousands of random market price paths. the var is the maximum expected loss in fair value, for a given confidence interval, to the company\u0092s foreign exchange portfolio due to adverse\nmovements in rates. the var model is not intended to represent actual losses but is used as a risk estimation and management tool. the model assumes normal market conditions. forecasted transactions, firm commitments, and assets and liabilities\ndenominated in foreign currencies were excluded from the model. based on the results of the model, the company estimates with 95% confidence a maximum one-day loss in fair value of $103 million as of september\u00a025, 2010 compared to a maximum\none-day loss in fair value of $44 million as of september\u00a026, 2009. because the company uses foreign currency instruments for hedging purposes, losses incurred on those instruments are generally offset by increases in the fair value of the\nunderlying exposures.actual future gains and losses associated with the company\u0092s investment portfolio and derivative\npositions may differ materially from the sensitivity analyses performed as of september\u00a025, 2010 due to the inherent limitations associated with predicting the changes in the timing and amount of interest rates, foreign currency exchanges rates\nand the company\u0092s actual exposures and positions.44"}}, "Item 8":

financial\nstatements in conformity with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles (\u0093gaap\u0094) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in these consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes.\nactual results could differ materially from those estimates. certain prior year amounts in the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto have been reclassified to conform to the current year\u0092s presentation.the company\u0092s fiscal year is the 52 or 53-week period that ends on the last saturday of september. the

standards board (\u0093fasb\u0094) amended the accounting standards related to revenue recognition for arrangements with multiple deliverables and arrangements\nthat include software elements (\u0093new accounting principles\u0094). the new accounting principles permitted prospective or retrospective adoption, and the company elected retrospective adoption during the first quarter of 2010.under the historical accounting principles, the company was required to account for sales of both iphone and apple tv using subscription\naccounting because the company indicated it might from time-to-time provide future unspecified software upgrades and features for those products free of charge. under subscription accounting, revenue and associated product cost of sales for iphone\nand apple tv were deferred at the time of sale and recognized on a straight-line basis over each product\u0092s estimated economic life. this resulted in the deferral of significant amounts of revenue and cost of sales related to iphone and apple\ntv.the new accounting principles affect the company\u0092s accounting for all past and current sales of iphone, ipad, apple\ntv and for sales of ipod touch beginning in june 2010. the new accounting principles require the company to account for the sale of these devices as two deliverables. the first deliverable is the hardware and software essential to the functionality\nof the hardware device delivered at the time of sale, and the second deliverable is the right included with the purchase of these devices to receive on a when-and-if-available

accounting principles, which sections are incorporated herein by reference.revenue recognitionnet sales consist primarily of revenue from the sale\nof hardware, software, digital content and applications, peripherals, and service and support contracts. the company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the sales price is fixed or\ndeterminable, and collection is probable. product is considered delivered to the customer once it has been shipped and title and risk of loss have been transferred. for most of the company\u0092s product sales, these criteria are met at the time the\nproduct is shipped. for online sales to individuals, for some sales to education customers in the u.s., and for certain other sales, the company defers revenue until the customer receives the product because the company legally retains a portion of\nthe risk of loss on these sales during transit. the company recognizes revenue from the sale of hardware products (e.g., macs, iphones, ipads, ipods and peripherals), software bundled with hardware that is essential to the functionality of the\nhardware, and third-party digital content sold on the itunes store in accordance with general revenue recognition accounting guidance. the company recognizes revenue in accordance with industry specific software accounting guidance for the following\ntypes of sales transactions: (i)\u00a0standalone sales of software products, (ii)\u00a0sales of software upgrades and (iii)\u00a0sales of software bundled with hardware not essential to the functionality of the hardware.the company sells software and peripheral products obtained from other companies. the company generally establishes its own pricing and\nretains related inventory risk, is the primary obligor in sales transactions with its customers, and assumes the credit risk for amounts billed to its customers. accordingly, the company generally recognizes revenue for the sale of products obtained\nfrom other companies based on the gross amount billed. for certain sales made through the itunes store, including sales of third-party software applications for the company\u0092s ios devices, the company is not the primary obligor to users of the\nsoftware, and third-party developers determine the selling price of their software. therefore, the company accounts for such sales on a net basis by recognizing only the commission it retains from each sale and including that commission in net sales\nin the consolidated statements of operations. the portion of the sales price paid by users that is remitted by the company to third-party developers is not reflected in the company\u0092s consolidated statement of operations.the company records deferred revenue when it receives payments in advance of the delivery of products or the performance of services.\nthis includes amounts that have been deferred related to embedded unspecified and specified software upgrades rights. the company sells gift cards redeemable at its retail and online stores, and also sells gift cards redeemable on the itunes store\nfor the purchase of content and software. the company records deferred revenue upon the sale of the card, which is relieved upon redemption of the card by the customer. revenue from applecare service and support contracts is deferred and recognized\nratably over the service coverage periods. applecare service and support contracts typically include extended phone support, repair services, web-based support resources and diagnostic tools offered under the company\u0092s standard limited\nwarranty.the company records reductions to revenue for estimated commitments related to price protection and for customer\nincentive programs, including reseller and end-user rebates, and other sales programs and volume-based incentives. the estimated cost of these programs is recognized in the period the company has sold the product and committed to a plan. the company\nalso records reductions to revenue for expected future product returns based on the company\u0092s historical experience. revenue is recorded net of taxes collected from customers that are remitted to governmental authorities, with the collected\ntaxes recorded as current liabilities until remitted to the relevant government authority.51"}, "6": {"tables": {}, "text": "revenue recognition for\narrangements with multiple deliverablesfor multi-element arrangements that include tangible products that contain\nsoftware that is essential to the tangible product\u0092s functionality and undelivered software elements that relate to the tangible product\u0092s essential software, the company allocates revenue to all deliverables based on their relative\nselling prices. in such circumstances, the company uses a hierarchy to determine the selling price to be used for allocating revenue to deliverables: (i)\u00a0vendor-specific objective evidence of fair value (\u0093vsoe\u0094), (ii)\u00a0third-party\nevidence of selling price (\u0093tpe\u0094), and (iii)\u00a0best estimate of the selling price (\u0093esp\u0094). vsoe generally exists only when the company sells the deliverable separately and is the price actually charged by the company for that\ndeliverable. esps reflect the company\u0092s best estimates of what the selling prices of elements would be if they were sold regularly on a stand-alone basis.as described in more detail below, for all past and current sales of iphone, ipad, apple tv and for sales of ipod touch beginning in june 2010, the company has indicated it may from time-to-time provide\nfuture unspecified software upgrades and features free of charge to customers. the company has identified two deliverables in arrangements involving the sale of these devices. the first deliverable is the hardware and software essential to the\nfunctionality of the hardware device delivered at the time of sale. the second deliverable is the embedded right included with the purchase of iphone, ipad, ipod touch and apple tv to receive on a when-and-if-available basis, future unspecified\nsoftware upgrades and features relating to the product\u0092s essential software. the company has allocated revenue between these two deliverables using the relative selling price method. because the company has neither vsoe nor tpe for the two\ndeliverables, the allocation of revenue has been based on the company\u0092s esps. amounts allocated to the delivered hardware and the related essential software are recognized at the time of sale provided the other conditions for revenue\nrecognition have been met. amounts allocated to the embedded unspecified software upgrade rights are deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis over the 24-month estimated life of each of these devices. all product cost of sales, including\nestimated warranty costs, are recognized at the time of sale. costs for engineering and sales and marketing are expensed as incurred.the company\u0092s process for determining its esp for deliverables without vsoe or tpe considers multiple factors that may vary depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each\ndeliverable. the company believes its customers, particularly consumers, would be reluctant to buy unspecified software upgrade rights related to iphone, ipad, ipod touch and apple tv. this view is primarily based on the fact that unspecified\nupgrade rights do not obligate the company to provide upgrades at a particular time or at all, and do not specify to customers which upgrades or features will be delivered. therefore, the company has concluded that if it were to sell upgrade rights\non a standalone basis, including those rights associated with iphone, ipad, ipod touch and apple tv, the selling price would be relatively low. key factors considered by the company in developing the esps for these upgrade rights include prices\ncharged by the company for similar offerings, the company\u0092s historical pricing practices, the nature of the upgrade rights (e.g., unspecified and when-and-if-available), and the relative esp of the upgrade rights as compared to the total\nselling price of the product. the company may also consider, when appropriate, the impact of other products and services, including advertising services, on selling price assumptions when developing and reviewing its esps for software upgrade rights\nand related deliverables. the company may also consider additional factors as appropriate, including the pricing of competitive alternatives if they exist, and product-specific business objectives.beginning in the third quarter of 2010 in conjunction with the announcement of ios 4, the company\u0092s esps for the embedded software\nupgrade rights included with iphone, ipad and ipod touch reflect the positive financial impact expected by the company as a result of its introduction of a mobile advertising platform for these devices and the expectation of customers regarding\nsoftware that includes or supports an advertising component. ios 4 supports iad, the company\u0092s new mobile advertising platform, which enables applications on iphone, ipad and ipod touch to embed media-rich advertisements.for all periods presented, the company\u0092s esp for the embedded software upgrade right

iphone to $10.beginning with initial sales of ipad in april 2010, the company has also\nindicated it may from time-to-time provide future unspecified software upgrades and features free of charge to ipad customers. the company\u0092s esp for the embedded software upgrade right included with the sale of each ipad is $10. in june 2010,\nthe company announced that certain previously sold ipod touch models would receive an upgrade to ios 4 free of charge and indicated ipod touch devices running on ios 4 may from time-to-time receive future unspecified software upgrades and features\nfree of charge. the company\u0092s esp for the embedded software upgrade right included with each ipod touch sold beginning in june 2010 is $5.the company accounts for multiple element arrangements that consist only of software or software-related products, including the sale of upgrades to previously sold software, in accordance with industry\nspecific accounting guidance for software and software-related transactions. for such transactions, revenue on arrangements that include multiple elements is allocated to each element based on the relative fair value of each element, and fair value\nis determined by vsoe. if the company cannot objectively determine the fair value of any undelivered element included in such multiple-element arrangements, the company defers revenue until all elements are delivered and services have been\nperformed, or until fair value can objectively be determined for any remaining undelivered elements. when the fair value of a delivered element has not been established, but fair value exists for the undelivered elements, the company uses the\nresidual method to recognize revenue. under the residual method, the fair value of the undelivered elements is deferred and the remaining portion of the arrangement fee is allocated to the delivered elements and is recognized as revenue.except as described for iphone, ipad, ipod touch and apple tv, the company generally does not offer unspecified upgrade rights to its\ncustomers in connection with software sales or the sale of applecare extended warranty and support contracts. a limited number of the company\u0092s software products are available with maintenance agreements that grant customers rights to\nunspecified future upgrades over the maintenance term on a when and if available basis. revenue associated with such maintenance is recognized ratably over the maintenance term.shipping costsfor all periods presented, amounts billed to customers\nrelated to shipping and handling are classified as revenue, and the company\u0092s shipping and handling costs are included in cost of sales.warranty expensethe\ncompany generally provides for the estimated cost of hardware and software warranties at the time the related revenue is recognized. the company assesses the adequacy of its pre-existing warranty liabilities and adjusts the amounts as necessary\nbased on actual experience and changes in future estimates.software development costsresearch and development costs are expensed as incurred. development costs of computer software to be sold, leased, or otherwise marketed\nare subject to capitalization beginning when a product\u0092s technological feasibility has been established and ending when a product is available for general release to customers. in most instances, the company\u0092s products are released soon\nafter technological feasibility has been established. therefore, costs incurred subsequent to achievement of technological feasibility are usually not significant, and generally most software development costs have been expensed as incurred.the company did not capitalize any software development costs during 2010. in 2009 and 2008, the company

for stock-based payment transactions in which the company receives employee services in exchange for (a)\u00a0equity instruments of the enterprise or (b)\u00a0liabilities that are\nbased on the fair value of the enterprise\u0092s equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of such equity instruments. stock-based compensation cost for restricted stock units (\u0093rsus\u0094) is measured based on the closing fair\nmarket value of the company\u0092s common stock on the date of grant. stock-based compensation cost for stock options is estimated at the grant date based on each option\u0092s fair-value as calculated by the black-scholes-merton (\u0093bsm\u0094)\noption-pricing model. the company recognizes stock-based compensation cost as expense ratably on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. the company will recognize a benefit from stock-based compensation in equity if an incremental\ntax benefit is realized by following the ordering provisions of the tax law. in addition, the company accounts for the indirect effects of stock-based compensation on the research tax credit, the foreign tax credit and the domestic manufacturing\ndeduction through

using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in effect for the years in which those tax\nassets are expected to be realized or settled. the company records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is believed more likely than not to be realized.the company recognizes the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than

classification of its investments in debt securities at the time of purchase and reevaluates the available-for-sale designations as of each balance sheet date. the company classifies its marketable debt securities as either short-term or\nlong-term based on each instrument\u0092s underlying contractual maturity date. marketable securities with maturities of less than 12 months are classified as short-term and marketable securities with maturities greater than 12 months are classified\nas long-term. these securities are carried at fair value, with the unrealized gains and losses, net of taxes, reported as a component of shareholders\u0092 equity. the cost of securities sold is based upon the specific identification method.derivative financial instrumentsthe company accounts for its derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities and carries them at fair value. derivatives that are not defined as hedges must be adjusted to fair value through\nearnings.for derivative

the shorter of lease terms or ten years for leasehold improvements. the company\ncapitalizes eligible costs to acquire or develop internal-use software that are incurred subsequent to the preliminary project stage. capitalized costs related to internal-use software are amortized using the straight-line method over the estimated\nuseful lives of the assets, which range from three to five years.

acquired intangible assetsthe company reviews property, plant and equipment and certain identifiable intangibles, excluding goodwill, for impairment. long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in\ncircumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. recoverability of these assets is measured by comparison of their carrying amounts to future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate. if property,\nplant and equipment and certain identifiable intangibles are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized equals the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds its fair market value. the company did not record any\nsignificant impairments during 2010, 2009 and 2008.the company

2010, the company\nadopted the new fair value accounting principles for all non-financial assets and non-financial liabilities, except for items that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis, which did not have a\nmaterial effect on the company\u0092s financial condition or operating results.the company applies fair value accounting for\nall

into u.s. dollars using exchange\nrates in effect at the end of each period. revenue and expenses for these subsidiaries are translated using rates that approximate those in effect during the period. gains and losses from these translations are credited or charged to foreign\ncurrency translation included in accumulated other comprehensive income in shareholders\u0092 equity. the company\u0092s subsidiaries that use the u.s. dollar as their functional currency remeasure monetary assets and liabilities at exchange rates\nin effect at the end of each period, and inventories, property, and

and measure in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree in a business combination. this new accounting standard also\nestablished principles regarding how goodwill acquired in a business combination or a gain from a bargain purchase should be recognized and measured, requiring the capitalization of in-process research and development at fair value and the expensing\nof acquisition-related costs as incurred, as well as providing guidelines on the disclosure requirements. in april 2009, the fasb amended this new accounting standard to require that assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination\nthat arise from contingencies be recognized at fair value, if the fair value can be determined during the measurement period. the company adopted the new business combination accounting standard in the first quarter of 2010 and applied these\nprinciples to any business

transfer\na liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. when determining the fair value measurements for assets and liabilities, which are required to be recorded at fair value, the company considers the principal\nor most advantageous market in which the company would transact and the market-based risk measurements or assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, such as inherent risk, transfer restrictions and credit risk.the company applies the following fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value into three\nlevels and bases the categorization within the hierarchy upon the lowest level of input that is available and significant to the fair value measurement:level 1 \u0096 quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.level 2 \u0096 observable inputs other than quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in inactive markets,\nor other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially

respectively, in connection with tax matters.the company is subject to taxation and files income tax returns in the u.s. federal jurisdiction and in many state and foreign jurisdictions. for u.s. federal income tax purposes, all years prior to 2004\nare closed. the internal revenue service (the \u0093irs\u0094) has completed its field audit of the company\u0092s federal income tax returns for the years 2004 through 2006 and proposed certain adjustments. the company has contested certain of\nthese adjustments through the irs appeals office. the irs is currently examining the years 2007 through 2009. during the third quarter of 2010, the company reached a tax settlement with the irs for the years 2002 through 2003. in connection with the\nsettlement, the company reduced its gross unrecognized tax benefits by $100 million and recognized a $52 million tax benefit in the third quarter of 2010. in addition, the company is also subject to audits by state, local and foreign tax\nauthorities.\u00a0in major states and major foreign jurisdictions, the years subsequent to 1988 and 2001, respectively, generally remain open and could be subject to examination by the taxing authorities.management believes that an adequate provision has been made for any adjustments that may result from tax examinations. however, the\noutcome of tax audits cannot be predicted with certainty. if any issues addressed in the company\u0092s tax audits are resolved in a manner not consistent with management\u0092s expectations, the company could be required to adjust its provision for\nincome tax in the period such resolution occurs. although timing of the resolution and/or closure of audits is not certain, the company does not believe it is reasonably possible that its unrecognized tax benefits would materially change in the next\n12\u00a0months.note 7 \u0096 shareholders\u0092 equity and stock-based compensationpreferred stockthe\ncompany has five million shares of

enclosures, certain liquid crystal displays (\u0093lcds\u0094), certain optical drives and application-specific integrated circuits (\u0093asics\u0094) are currently obtained by the company from single\nor limited sources, which subjects the company to significant supply and pricing risks. many of these and other key components that are available from multiple sources including but not limited to nand flash memory, dynamic random access memory\n(\u0093dram\u0094) and certain lcds, are subject at times to industry-wide shortages and significant commodity pricing fluctuations. in addition, the company has entered into certain agreements for the supply of key components including but not\nlimited to microprocessors, nand flash memory, dram and lcds at favorable pricing, but there is no guarantee that the company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar favorable terms, or at all, upon expiration or otherwise obtain\nfavorable pricing in the future.

for their products. in addition, the company uses some custom components that are not common to the rest of these industries, and new products introduced by the company\noften utilize custom components available from only one source. when a component or product uses new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers\u0092 yields have matured or manufacturing capacity has increased. if the\ncompany\u0092s supply of a key single-sourced component for a new or existing product were delayed or constrained, if such components were available only at significantly higher prices, or if a key manufacturing vendor delayed shipments of completed\nproducts to the company, the company\u0092s financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected. the company\u0092s business and financial performance could also be adversely affected depending on the time required to\nobtain sufficient quantities from the original source, or to identify and obtain sufficient quantities from an alternative source. continued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at all, may be affected if those suppliers decided\nto

part i, item\u00a03 of this form 10-k under the heading \u0093legal proceedings.\u0094 in the opinion of management, the company does not have a potential liability related to any current legal proceedings and\nclaims that would individually or in the aggregate materially adversely affect its financial condition or operating results. however, the results of legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty. if the company failed to prevail in any of\nthese legal matters or if several of these legal matters were resolved against the company in the same reporting period, the

for each of the three patents asserted.\u00a0the company is challenging\nthe verdict, believes it has valid defenses and has not recorded a loss contingency at this time.production and marketing of\nproducts in certain states and countries may subject the company to environmental, product safety and other regulations including, in some instances, the requirement to provide customers the

several jurisdictions in which the company operates, including various countries within europe and asia and\ncertain states and provinces within north america. although the company does not anticipate any material adverse effects in the future based on the nature of its operations and the thrust of such laws, there is no assurance that such existing laws\nor future laws will not materially

and location of its customers, to be the americas, europe, japan, asia-pacific and retail operations. the americas, europe, japan and asia-pacific reportable segment results do not include results of\nthe retail segment. the americas segment includes both north and south america. the europe segment includes european countries, as well as the middle east and78"}, "33": {"tables": {}, "text": "africa. the asia-pacific segment includes australia and asia, but does not include japan. the retail segment operates apple retail stores in 11 countries, including the u.s. each reportable\noperating segment provides similar hardware and software products and similar services. the accounting policies of the various segments are the same as those described in note 1, \u0093summary of significant accounting policies.\u0094the company evaluates the performance of its operating segments based on net sales and operating income. net sales for geographic\nsegments are generally based on the location of customers, while retail segment net sales are based on sales from the company\u0092s retail stores. operating income for each segment includes net sales to third parties, related cost of sales and\noperating expenses directly attributable to the segment. advertising expenses are generally included in the geographic segment in which the expenditures are incurred. operating income for each segment excludes other income and expense and certain\nexpenses managed outside the operating segments. costs excluded from segment operating income include various corporate expenses, such as manufacturing costs and variances not included in standard costs, research and development, corporate marketing\nexpenses, stock-based compensation expense, income taxes, various nonrecurring charges, and other separately managed general and administrative costs. the company does not include intercompany transfers between segments for management reporting\npurposes. segment assets exclude corporate assets, such as cash, short-term and long-term investments, manufacturing and corporate facilities, miscellaneous corporate infrastructure, goodwill and other acquired intangible assets. except for the\nretail segment, capital asset purchases for long-lived assets are not reported to management by segment. cash payments for capital asset purchases by the retail segment were $392 million, $369 million and $389 million for 2010, 2009 and 2008,\nrespectively.the company has certain retail stores that have been designed and built to serve as high-profile venues to\npromote brand awareness and serve as vehicles for corporate sales and marketing activities. because of their unique design elements, locations and size, these stores require substantially more investment than the company\u0092s more typical retail\nstores. the company allocates certain operating expenses associated with its high-profile stores to corporate marketing expense to reflect the estimated company-wide benefit. the allocation of these operating costs to corporate expense is based on\nthe amount incurred for a high-profile store in excess of that incurred by a more typical company retail location. the company had opened a total of 15 high-profile stores as of september\u00a025, 2010. amounts allocated to corporate expense\nresulting from the operations of high-profile stores were $75 million, $65 million and $53 million for 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.79"}, "34": {"tables": {"0": [["2010", "2009", "2008", "Americas"], ["Net sales", "24498", "18981", "16552"],
