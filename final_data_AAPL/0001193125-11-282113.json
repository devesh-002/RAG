operating results could be materially adversely affected.the company\u0092s products and services\ncompete in highly competitive global markets characterized by aggressive price cutting, with resulting downward pressure on gross margins, frequent introduction of new products, short product life cycles, evolving industry standards, continual\nimprovement in product price/performance characteristics, rapid adoption of technological and product advancements by competitors, and price sensitivity on the part of consumers.the company\u0092s ability to compete successfully depends heavily on its ability to ensure a continuing and timely introduction of\ninnovative new products and technologies to the marketplace. the company believes it is unique in that it designs and develops nearly the entire solution for its products, including the hardware, operating system, numerous software applications, and\nrelated services. as a result, the company must make significant investments in research and development and as such, the company currently holds a significant number of patents and copyrights and has registered and/or has applied to register\nnumerous patents, trademarks and service marks. by contrast, many of the company\u0092s competitors seek to compete primarily through aggressive pricing and very low cost structures. if the company is unable to continue to develop and sell\ninnovative new products with attractive margins or if other companies infringe on the company\u0092s intellectual property, the company\u0092s ability to maintain a competitive advantage could be negatively affected and its financial condition and\noperating results could be materially adversely affected.the company markets certain mobile communication and media devices\nbased on the ios mobile operating system and also markets related third-party digital content and applications. the company faces substantial competition in these markets from companies that have significant technical, marketing, distribution and\nother resources, as well as established hardware, software and digital content supplier relationships. additionally, the company faces significant price competition as competitors reduce their selling prices and attempt to imitate the company\u0092s\nproduct features and applications within their own products or, alternatively, collaborate with each other to offer solutions that are more competitive than those they currently offer. the company also competes with illegitimate ways to obtain\nthird-party digital content and applications. the company has entered the mobile communications and media device markets, and some of its competitors in these markets have greater experience, product breadth and distribution channels than the\ncompany. because some current and potential competitors have substantial resources and/or experience and a lower cost structure, they may be able to provide such products and services at little or no profit or even at a loss. the company also\nexpects competition to intensify as competitors attempt to imitate the company\u0092s approach to providing these components seamlessly within their individual offerings or work collaboratively to offer integrated solutions. the company\u0092s\nfinancial condition and operating results depend substantially on the company\u0092s ability to continually improve ios and ios devices in order to maintain their functional and design advantages.the company is the only authorized maker of hardware using mac os x, which has a minority market share in the personal computer market.\nthis market is dominated by computer makers using competing operating systems, most notably windows. in the market for personal computers and peripherals, the company faces a significant number of competitors, many of which have broader product\nlines, lower priced products, and a larger installed customer base. consolidation in this market has resulted in larger and potentially stronger competitors. price competition has been particularly intense as competitors selling windows-based\npersonal computers have aggressively cut prices and lowered product margins. an increasing number of internet devices that include software applications and are smaller and simpler than traditional personal computers compete for market share with\nthe company\u0092s existing products. the company\u0092s financial condition and operating results depend substantially on its ability to continually improve the mac platform to maintain its functional and design advantages.10"}, "1": {"tables": {}, "text": "there can be no assurance the company will be able to continue to provide products and\nservices that compete effectively.to remain competitive and stimulate customer demand, the company must successfully\nmanage frequent product introductions and transitions.due to the highly volatile and competitive nature of the industries\nin which the company competes, the company must continually introduce new products, services and technologies, enhance existing products and services, and effectively stimulate customer demand for new and upgraded products. the success of new\nproduct introductions depends on a number of factors including but not limited to timely and successful product development, market acceptance, the company\u0092s ability to manage the risks associated with new products and production ramp issues,\nthe availability of application software for new products, the effective management of purchase commitments and inventory levels in line with anticipated product demand, the availability of products in appropriate quantities and costs to meet\nanticipated demand, and the risk that new products may have quality or other defects in the early stages of introduction. accordingly, the company cannot determine in advance the ultimate effect of new product introductions and transitions on its\nfinancial condition and operating results.the company faces substantial inventory and other asset risk in addition to\npurchase commitment cancellation risk.the company records a write-down for product and component inventories that have\nbecome obsolete or exceed anticipated demand or net realizable value and accrues necessary cancellation fee reserves for orders of excess products and components. the company also reviews its long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or\nchanged circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. if the company determines that impairment has occurred, it records a write-down equal to the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds its fair\nmarket value. although the company believes its provisions related to inventory, other assets and purchase commitments are currently adequate, no assurance can be given that the company will not incur additional related charges given the rapid and\nunpredictable pace of product obsolescence in the industries in which the company competes. such charges could materially adversely affect the company\u0092s financial condition and operating results.the company must order components for its products and build inventory in advance of product announcements and shipments. consistent with\nindustry practice, components are normally acquired through a combination of purchase orders, supplier contracts, open orders and, where appropriate, inventory component prepayments, in each case based on projected demand. such purchase commitments\ntypically cover forecasted component and manufacturing requirements for periods up to 150 days. because the company\u0092s markets are volatile, competitive and subject to rapid technology and price changes, there is a risk the company will forecast\nincorrectly and order or produce excess or insufficient amounts of components or products, or not fully utilize firm purchase commitments. the company\u0092s financial condition and operating results have been in the past and could be in the future\nmaterially adversely affected by the company\u0092s ability to manage its inventory levels and respond to short-term shifts in customer demand patterns.future operating results depend upon the company\u0092s ability to obtain components in sufficient quantities.because the company currently obtains components from single or limited sources, the company is subject to significant supply and pricing risks. many components that are available from multiple sources\nare at times subject to industry-wide shortages and significant commodity pricing fluctuations. the company has entered into various agreements for the supply of components; there can be no guarantee that the company will be able to extend or renew\nthese agreements on similar terms, or at all. the follow-on effects from the credit crisis on\u00a0the company\u0092s suppliers, referred to in \u0093economic conditions could materially adversely affect the company\u0094 above, also could\naffect the company\u0092s ability to obtain components. therefore, the company remains subject to significant risks of supply shortages and price increases that could materially adversely affect the company\u0092s11"}, "2": {"tables": {}, "text": "financial condition and operating results. the company expects to experience decreases in its gross margin percentage in future periods, as compared to levels achieved during 2011, largely due to\na higher mix of new and innovative products with flat or reduced pricing that have higher cost structures and deliver greater value to customers, and potential future component cost and other cost increases.the company and other participants in the mobile communication and media device, and personal computer industries compete for various\ncomponents with other industries that have experienced increased demand for their products. the company uses some custom components that are not common to the rest of these industries. the company\u0092s new products often utilize custom components\navailable from only one source. when a component or product uses new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers\u0092 yields have matured or manufacturing capacity has increased. continued availability of these\ncomponents at acceptable prices, or at all, may be affected if those suppliers decided to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the company\u0092s requirements. if the supply of components for a\nnew or existing product were delayed or constrained, or if a key manufacturing vendor delayed shipments of completed products to the company, the company\u0092s financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected.the company depends on component and product manufacturing and logistical services provided by outsourcing partners, many\nof whom are located outside of the u.s.substantially all of the company\u0092s manufacturing is performed in whole or in\npart by a few outsourcing partners primarily located in asia. the company has also outsourced much of its transportation and logistics management. while these arrangements may lower operating costs, they also reduce the company\u0092s direct control\nover production and distribution. it is uncertain what effect such diminished control will have on the quality or quantity of products or services, or the company\u0092s flexibility to respond to changing conditions. although arrangements with these\npartners may contain provisions for warranty expense reimbursement, the company may remain responsible to the consumer for warranty service in the event of product defects. the company also relies on its partners to adhere to the company\u0092s\nsupplier code of conduct. any unanticipated product defect or warranty liability, whether pursuant to arrangements with outsourcing partners or otherwise, or material violations of the supplier code of conduct, could materially adversely affect the\ncompany\u0092s reputation, financial condition and operating results.the supply and manufacture of many critical components\nis performed by sole-sourced outsourcing partners in the u.s., asia and europe. single-sourced outsourcing partners in asia perform final assembly of substantially all of the company\u0092s hardware products. if manufacturing or logistics in these\nlocations is disrupted for any reason including, but not limited to, natural and man-made disasters, information technology system failures, military actions or economic, business, labor, environmental, public health, or political issues, the\ncompany\u0092s financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected.the company relies on\nthird-party intellectual property and digital content, which may not be available to the company on commercially reasonable terms or at all.many of the company\u0092s products include third-party intellectual property, which requires licenses from those third parties. based on past experience and industry practice, the company believes such\nlicenses generally could be obtained on reasonable terms. there is however no assurance that the necessary licenses could be obtained on acceptable terms or at all. if the company is unable to obtain or renew critical licenses on reasonable terms,\nits financial condition and operating results may be materially adversely affected.the company also contracts with third\nparties to offer their digital content through the itunes store. the licensing arrangements with these third parties are short-term and do not guarantee the continuation or renewal of these arrangements on

company\u0092s financial condition and operating results may be materially adversely\naffected.many third-party content providers require the company to provide digital rights management (\u0093drm\u0094) and\nother security solutions. if these requirements change, the company may have to develop or license new technology to provide these solutions. there is no assurance the company will be able to develop or license such solutions at a reasonable cost\nand in a timely manner. in addition, certain countries have passed or may propose legislation that would force the company to license its drm, which could lessen the protection of content and subject it to piracy and also could affect arrangements\nwith the company\u0092s content providers.the company\u0092s future results could be materially adversely affected if it\nis found to have infringed on intellectual property rights.technology companies, including many of the company\u0092s\ncompetitors, frequently enter into litigation based on allegations of patent infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. in addition, patent holding companies seek to monetize patents they have purchased or otherwise obtained.\nas the company has grown, the intellectual property rights claims against it have increased and may continue to increase. in particular, the company\u0092s cellular enabled products compete with mobile communication and media device companies that\nhold significant patent portfolios, and the number of patent claims against the company has significantly increased.\u00a0the company is vigorously defending infringement actions in courts in a number of u.s. jurisdictions and before the u.s.\ninternational trade commission, as well as internationally in europe and asia. the plaintiffs in these actions frequently seek injunctions and substantial damages.regardless of the scope or validity of such patents or\u00a0the merits of any patent claims by potential or actual litigants, the company may have to engage in protracted litigation. if the company is\nfound to infringe one or more patents, it may be required to pay substantial damages. if there is a temporary or permanent injunction prohibiting the company from marketing or selling certain products or a successful claim of infringement against\nthe company requiring it to pay royalties to a third-party, its financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected, regardless of whether it can develop non-infringing technology.in certain cases, the company may consider the desirability of entering into licensing agreements, although no assurance can be given\nthat such licenses can be obtained on acceptable terms or that litigation will not occur. these licenses may also significantly increase the company\u0092s operating expenses.in management\u0092s opinion there is not at least a reasonable possibility the company may have incurred a material loss, or a material loss in excess of a recorded accrual, with respect to loss\ncontingencies, including matters related to infringement of intellectual property rights. however, the outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain. therefore, although management considers the likelihood of such an outcome to be remote, if one or\nmore of these legal matters were resolved against the company in the same reporting period for amounts in excess of management\u0092s expectations, the company\u0092s consolidated financial statements of a particular reporting period could be\nmaterially adversely affected.the company\u0092s future performance depends in part on support from third-party software\ndevelopers.the company believes decisions by customers to purchase its hardware products depend in part on the\navailability of third-party software applications and services. there is no assurance that third-party developers will continue to develop and maintain software applications and services for the company\u0092s products. if third-party software\napplications and services cease to be developed and maintained for the company\u0092s products, customers may choose not to buy the company\u0092s products, which could materially adversely affect the company\u0092s financial condition and operating\nresults.13"}, "4": {"tables": {}, "text": "with respect to its mac products, the company believes the availability of third-party\nsoftware applications and services depends in part on the developers\u0092 perception and analysis of the relative benefits of developing, maintaining, and upgrading such software for the company\u0092s products compared to windows-based products.\nthis analysis may be based on factors such as the perceived strength of the company and its products, the anticipated revenue that may be generated, continued acceptance by customers of mac os x, and the costs of developing such applications and\nservices. if the company\u0092s minority share of the global personal computer market causes developers to question the company\u0092s prospects, developers could be less inclined to develop or upgrade software for the company\u0092s products and\nmore inclined to devote their resources to developing and upgrading software for the larger windows market.with respect to\nios devices, the company relies on the continued availability and development of compelling and innovative software applications, which are distributed through a single distribution channel, the app store. the absence of multiple distribution\nchannels, which are available for competing platforms, may limit the availability and acceptance of third-party applications by the company\u0092s customers, thereby causing developers to reduce or curtail development for the ios platform. in\naddition, ios devices are subject to rapid technological change, and, if third-party developers are unable to or choose not to keep up with this pace of change, third-party applications might not successfully operate and may result in dissatisfied\ncustomers. as with applications for the company\u0092s mac products, the availability and development of these applications also depend on developers\u0092 perceptions and analysis of the relative benefits of developing software for the\ncompany\u0092s products rather than its competitors\u0092 products, including devices that use competing platforms. if developers focus their efforts on these competing platforms, the availability and quality of applications for the company\u0092s\ndevices may suffer.the company\u0092s future operating performance depends on the performance of distributors, carriers\nand other resellers.the company distributes its products through wholesalers, resellers, national and regional retailers,\nand value-added resellers, many of whom distribute products from competing manufacturers. the company also sells many of its products and third-party products in most of its major markets directly to education customers, cellular network\ncarriers\u0092 distribution channels, resellers and consumers through its online and retail stores.carriers providing\ncellular network service for iphone typically subsidize users\u0092 purchase of the device. there is no assurance that such subsidies will be continued at all or in the same amounts upon renewal of the company\u0092s agreements with these carriers\nor in agreements the company enters into with new carriers.many resellers have narrow operating margins and have been\nnegatively affected in the past by weak economic conditions. some resellers have perceived the expansion of the company\u0092s direct sales as conflicting with their business interests as distributors and resellers of the company\u0092s products.\nsuch a perception could discourage resellers from investing resources in the distribution and sale of the company\u0092s products or lead them to limit or cease distribution of those products. the company has invested and will continue to invest in\nprograms to enhance reseller sales, including staffing selected resellers\u0092 stores with company employees and contractors and improving product placement displays. these programs could require a substantial investment while providing no\nassurance of return or incremental revenue. the company\u0092s financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected if the financial condition of these resellers weakens, if resellers stopped distributing the\ncompany\u0092s products, or if

substantial operating lease commitments for retail space. certain\nstores have been designed and built to serve as high-profile venues to promote brand awareness and serve as vehicles for corporate sales and marketing activities. because of their unique design elements, locations and size, these stores require\nsubstantially more investment than the company\u0092s more typical retail stores. due to the high fixed cost structure associated with the retail segment, a decline in sales or the closure or poor performance of individual or multiple stores could\nresult in significant lease

fiscal quarter compared to other fiscal quarters due to increased holiday seasonal demand. furthermore, the company sells more products from time-to-time during the third month of a quarter\nthan it does during either of the first two months. developments late in a quarter, such as lower-than-anticipated demand for the company\u0092s products, issues with new product introductions, an internal systems failure, or failure of one of the\ncompany\u0092s logistics, components supply, or manufacturing partners, could have a material adverse impact on the company\u0092s financial condition and operating results.the company\u0092s stock price is subject to volatility.the\ncompany\u0092s stock continues to experience substantial price volatility. additionally, the stock market as a whole has

the company believes its stock price reflects high future growth and profitability expectations. if the company fails to meet these expectations its stock price may\nsignificantly decline, which could have a material adverse impact on investor confidence and employee retention.the\ncompany\u0092s business is subject to the risks of international operations.the company derives a significant portion of\nits revenue and earnings from its international operations. compliance with applicable u.s. and foreign laws and regulations, such as import and export requirements, anti-corruption laws, tax laws, foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation\nrestrictions, data privacy requirements, environmental laws, labor laws, and anti-competition regulations, increases the costs of doing business in foreign jurisdictions. although the company has implemented policies and procedures to comply with\nthese laws and18"}, "9": {"tables": {}, "text": "regulations, a violation by the company\u0092s

the company\u0092s products in foreign countries, and on sales of products that include components obtained from foreign suppliers, could be materially adversely affected\nby foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and by international trade regulations, including duties, tariffs and antidumping penalties. the company is also exposed to credit and collectability risk on its trade receivables with customers in\ncertain international markets. there can be no assurance it can effectively limit its credit risk and avoid losses, which could materially adversely affect the company\u0092s financial condition and operating results.the company\u0092s primary exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates relate to non-u.s. dollar denominated sales and\noperating expenses worldwide. weakening of foreign currencies relative to the u.s. dollar will adversely affect the u.s. dollar value of the company\u0092s foreign currency-denominated sales and earnings, and generally will lead the company to raise\ninternational pricing, potentially reducing demand for the company\u0092s products. in some circumstances, due to competition or other reasons, the company may decide not to raise local prices to the full extent of the dollar\u0092s strengthening,\nor at all, which would adversely affect the u.s. dollar value of the company\u0092s foreign currency denominated sales and earnings. conversely, a strengthening of foreign currencies, while generally beneficial to the company\u0092s foreign\ncurrency-denominated sales and earnings, could cause the company to reduce international pricing and incur losses on its foreign currency derivative instruments, thereby limiting the benefit. additionally, strengthening of foreign currencies may\nalso increase the company\u0092s cost of product components denominated in those currencies, thus adversely affecting gross margins.the company has used derivative instruments, such as foreign currency forward and option contracts, to hedge certain exposures to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. the use of such hedging\nactivities may not offset any or more than a portion of the adverse financial effects of unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates over the limited time the hedges are in place.the company is exposed to credit risk and fluctuations in the market values of its investment portfolio.although the company has not recognized any significant losses to date on its cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, any\nsignificant declines in their market values could materially adversely affect the company\u0092s financial condition and operating results. given the global nature of its business, the company has both domestic and international investments. credit\nratings and pricing of these investments can be negatively affected by liquidity, credit deterioration, financial results, economic risk, political risk, sovereign risk or other factors. as a result, the value and liquidity of the company\u0092s\ncash, cash equivalents and marketable securities could decline and result in a significant impairment, which could materially adversely affect

continuing aftershocks. these geological events have caused significant damage in the region, including severe damage to nuclear power plants, and have impacted japan\u0092s power and other

of evacuation zones around the nuclear power plants.beyond the first quarter of 2012, uncertainty exists with respect to the availability of electrical power, the damage to nuclear power plants and

believes the company\u0092s critical accounting policies and estimates are those\nrelated to revenue recognition, valuation and impairment of marketable securities, inventory valuation and inventory purchase commitments, warranty costs, income taxes, and legal and other contingencies. management considers these policies critical\nbecause they are both important to the portrayal of the company\u0092s financial condition and operating results, and they require management to make judgments and estimates about inherently uncertain matters. the company\u0092s senior management\nhas reviewed these critical accounting policies and related disclosures with the audit and finance committee of the company\u0092s board of directors.revenue recognitionnet sales consist primarily of revenue from the sale\nof hardware, software, digital content and applications, peripherals, and service and support contracts. the company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the sales price is fixed or\ndeterminable, and collection is probable. product is considered delivered to the customer once it has been shipped and title and risk of loss have been transferred. for most of the company\u0092s product sales, these criteria are met at the time the\nproduct is shipped. for online sales to individuals, for some sales to education customers in the u.s., and for certain other sales, the company defers recognition of revenue until the customer receives the product because the company retains a\nportion of the risk of loss on these sales during transit. the company recognizes revenue from the sale of hardware products, software bundled with hardware that is essential to the functionality of the hardware, and third-party digital content sold\non the itunes store in accordance with general revenue recognition accounting guidance. the company recognizes revenue in accordance with industry specific software accounting guidance for the following types of sales transactions:\n(i)\u00a0standalone sales of software products, (ii)\u00a0sales of software upgrades and (iii)\u00a0sales of software bundled with hardware not essential to the functionality of the hardware.for multi-element arrangements that include hardware products containing software essential to the hardware product\u0092s functionality,\nundelivered software elements that relate to the hardware product\u0092s essential software, and undelivered non-software services, the company allocates revenue to all deliverables based on their relative selling prices. in such circumstances, the\ncompany uses a hierarchy to determine the selling price to be used for allocating revenue to deliverables: (i)\u00a0vendor-specific objective evidence of fair value (\u0093vsoe\u0094), (ii)\u00a0third-party evidence of selling price\n(\u0093tpe\u0094) and (iii)\u00a0best estimate of the selling price (\u0093esp\u0094). vsoe generally exists only when the company sells the deliverable separately and is the price actually charged by the company for that deliverable. esps reflect\nthe company\u0092s best estimates of what the selling prices of elements would be if they were sold regularly on a stand-alone basis.for sales of iphone, ipad, apple tv, for sales of ipod touch beginning in june 2010, and for sales of mac beginning in june 2011, the company has indicated it may from time-to-time provide future\nunspecified software upgrades and features free of charge to customers. in june 2011, the company announced it would begin providing various non-software services to owners of qualifying versions of ios devices and mac. because the company has\nneither vsoe nor tpe for these unspecified software upgrade rights or the non-software services, revenue is allocated to these rights and services based on the company\u0092s esps. amounts allocated to the unspecified software upgrade rights and\nnon-software services are deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis over the estimated lives of each of these devices, which range from 24 to 48 months. the company\u0092s process for determining esps involves management\u0092s judgment. the\ncompany\u0092s process considers multiple factors that may vary over time depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each deliverable. if the facts and circumstances underlying the factors considered change, including the estimated\nor actual costs incurred to provide non-software services or the estimated lives of the related devices, or should future facts and circumstances lead the company to consider additional factors, the company\u0092s esp for software upgrades and\nnon-software services related to future sales of these devices could change. if the estimated life of one or more of the devices should change, the future rate of amortization of the revenue allocated to the software upgrade rights would also\nchange.27"}, "2": {"tables": {}, "text": "the company records reductions to revenue for estimated commitments related to price\nprotection and for customer incentive programs, including reseller and end-user rebates, and other sales programs and volume-based incentives. for transactions involving price protection, the company recognizes revenue net of the estimated amount to\nbe refunded, provided the refund amount can be reasonably and reliably estimated and the other conditions for revenue recognition have been met. the company\u0092s policy requires that, if refunds cannot be reliably estimated, revenue is not\nrecognized until reliable estimates can be made or the price protection lapses. for customer incentive programs, the estimated cost of these programs is recognized at the later of the date at which the company has sold the product or the date at\nwhich the program is offered. the company also records reductions to revenue for expected future product returns based on the company\u0092s historical experience. future market conditions and product transitions may require the company to increase\ncustomer incentive programs and incur incremental price protection obligations that could result in additional reductions to revenue at the time such programs are offered. additionally, certain customer incentive programs require management to\nestimate the number of customers who will actually redeem the incentive. management\u0092s estimates are based on historical experience and the specific terms and conditions of particular incentive programs. if a greater than estimated proportion of\ncustomers redeem such incentives, the company would be required to record additional reductions to revenue, which would have a negative impact on the company\u0092s results of operations.valuation and impairment of marketable securitiesthe company\u0092s\ninvestments in available-for-sale securities are reported at fair value. unrealized gains and losses related to changes in the fair value of securities are recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income, net of tax, in the company\u0092s\nconsolidated balance sheets. changes in the fair value of available-for-sale securities impact the company\u0092s net income only when such securities are sold or an other-than-temporary impairment is recognized. realized gains and losses on the\nsale of securities are determined by specific identification of each security\u0092s cost basis. the company regularly reviews its investment portfolio to determine if any security is other-than-temporarily impaired, which would require the company\nto record an impairment charge in the period any such determination is made. in making this judgment, the company evaluates, among other things, the duration and extent to which the fair value of a security is less than its cost, the financial\ncondition of the issuer and any changes thereto, and the company\u0092s intent to sell, or whether it is more likely than not it will be required to sell, the security before recovery of the its amortized cost basis. the company\u0092s assessment on\nwhether a security is other-than-temporarily impaired, could change in the future due to new developments or changes in assumptions related to any particular security.inventory valuation and inventory purchase commitmentsthe company must\norder components for its products and build inventory in advance of product shipments. the company records a write-down for inventories of components and products, including third-party products held for resale, which have become obsolete or are in\nexcess of anticipated demand or net realizable value. the company performs a detailed review of inventory each fiscal quarter that considers multiple factors including demand forecasts, product life cycle status, product development plans, current\nsales levels, and component cost trends. the industries in which the company competes are subject to a rapid and unpredictable pace of product and component obsolescence and demand changes. if future demand or market conditions for the\ncompany\u0092s products are less favorable than forecasted or if unforeseen technological changes negatively impact the utility of component inventory, the company may be required to record additional write-downs, which would negatively affect its\nresults of operations in the period when the write-downs were recorded.the company records accruals for estimated\ncancellation fees related to component orders that have been cancelled or are expected to be cancelled. consistent with industry practice, the company acquires components through a combination of purchase orders, supplier contracts, and open orders\nbased on projected demand information. these commitments typically cover the company\u0092s requirements for periods up to 150 days. if there is an abrupt and substantial decline in demand for one or more of the company\u0092s products or an\nunanticipated change in technological requirements for any of the company\u0092s products, the company may be required to28"}, "3": {"tables": {}, "text": "record additional accruals for cancellation fees that would negatively affect its results of operations in the period when the cancellation fees are identified and recorded.warranty coststhe\ncompany provides for the estimated cost of hardware and software warranties at the time the related revenue is recognized based on historical and projected warranty claim rates, historical and projected cost-per-claim, and knowledge of specific\nproduct failures that are outside of the company\u0092s typical experience. each quarter, the company reevaluates its estimates to assess the adequacy of its recorded warranty liabilities considering the size of the installed base of products\nsubject to warranty protection and adjusts the amounts as necessary. if actual product failure rates or repair costs differ from estimates, revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required and could materially affect the\ncompany\u0092s results of operations.income taxesthe company records a tax provision for the anticipated tax consequences of the reported results of operations. the provision for income taxes is computed using the asset and liability method, under which\ndeferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards.\ndeferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in effect for the years in which those tax assets are expected to be realized or settled. the company records a valuation allowance\nto reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is believed more likely than not to be realized.the company recognizes tax\nbenefits from uncertain tax positions only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. the tax benefits recognized in the financial\nstatements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement.management believes it is more likely than not that forecasted income, including income that may be generated as a result of certain tax planning strategies, together with future reversals of existing\ntaxable temporary differences, will be sufficient to fully recover the deferred tax assets. in the event that the company determines all or part of the net deferred tax assets are not realizable in the future, the company will make an adjustment to\nthe valuation allowance that would be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made. in addition, the calculation of tax liabilities involves significant judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of gaap\nand complex tax laws. resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with management\u0092s expectations could have a material impact on the company\u0092s financial condition and operating results.legal and other contingenciesas discussed in part i, item\u00a03 of this form 10-k under the heading \u0093legal proceedings\u0094 and in note 7, \u0093commitments and contingencies\u0094 in notes to consolidated financial\nstatements, the company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business. the company records a liability when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable. there\nis significant judgment required in both the probability determination and as to whether an exposure can be reasonably estimated. in the opinion of management, there was not at least a reasonable possibility the company may have incurred a material\nloss, or a material loss in excess of a recorded accrual, with respect to loss contingencies. however, the outcome of legal proceedings and claims brought against the company are subject to significant uncertainty. therefore, although management\nconsiders the likelihood of such an outcome to be remote, if one or more of these legal matters were resolved against the company in the same reporting period for amounts in excess of management\u0092s expectations, the company\u0092s consolidated\nfinancial statements of a particular reporting period could be materially adversely affected.29"}, "4": {"tables": {"0": [["2011", "Change", "2010", "Change", "2009", "Net Sales by Operating Segment"],

competitive\npressures when there have been significant volatility in foreign currency exchange rates.the company may enter into foreign\ncurrency forward and option contracts with financial institutions to protect against foreign exchange risks associated with certain existing assets and liabilities, certain firmly committed transactions, forecasted future cash flows, and

exposures.to provide a meaningful assessment of the foreign currency risk associated with certain of the company\u0092s foreign currency derivative positions, the company performed a sensitivity analysis using a\nvalue-at-risk (\u0093var\u0094) model to assess the potential impact of fluctuations in exchange rates. the var model consisted of using a monte carlo simulation to generate thousands of random market price paths assuming normal market conditions.\nthe var is the maximum expected loss in fair value, for a given confidence interval, to the company\u0092s foreign currency

enterprise\nand government customers.basis of presentation and preparationthe accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the company. intercompany accounts and transactions have been\neliminated. the preparation of these consolidated financial statements in conformity with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles (\u0093gaap\u0094) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in\nthese consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. actual results could differ materially from those estimates. certain prior year amounts in the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto have been reclassified to conform to\nthe current year\u0092s presentation.the company\u0092s fiscal year is the 52 or 53-week period that ends on the last\nsaturday of september. the company\u0092s fiscal years 2011, 2010 and 2009 ended on september\u00a024, 2011,\u00a0september\u00a025, 2010 and september\u00a026, 2009, respectively, and included 52 weeks each. an additional week is included in the\nfirst fiscal quarter approximately every six years to realign fiscal quarters with calendar quarters. fiscal year 2012 will end on september\u00a029, 2012, and will span 53 weeks, with a 14th week added to the first quarter of 2012. unless otherwise\nstated, references to particular years or quarters refer to the company\u0092s fiscal years ended in september and the associated quarters of those fiscal years.during the first quarter of 2011, the company adopted the financial accounting standard board\u0092s (\u0093fasb\u0094) new accounting standard\u00a0on consolidation of variable interest\nentities.\u00a0this new accounting standard eliminates the mandatory quantitative approach in determining control for\u00a0evaluating whether variable interest entities need to be consolidated\u00a0in favor of a qualitative analysis, and requires an\nongoing reassessment\u00a0of control over such entities. the adoption of this new accounting standard did not impact the company\u0092s consolidated financial statements.revenue recognitionnet sales consist primarily of revenue from the sale\nof hardware, software, digital content and applications, peripherals, and service and support contracts. the company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the sales price is fixed or\ndeterminable, and collection is probable. product is considered delivered to the customer once it has been shipped and title and risk of loss have been transferred. for most of the company\u0092s product sales, these criteria are met at the time the\nproduct is shipped. for online sales to individuals, for some sales to education customers in the u.s., and for certain other sales, the company defers revenue until the customer receives the product because the company legally retains a portion of\nthe risk of loss on these sales during transit. the company recognizes revenue from the sale of hardware products, software bundled with hardware that is essential to the functionality of the hardware, and third-party digital content sold on the\nitunes store in accordance with general revenue recognition accounting guidance. the company recognizes revenue in accordance with industry specific software accounting guidance for the following types of sales transactions: (i)\u00a0standalone\nsales of software products, (ii)\u00a0sales of software upgrades and (iii)\u00a0sales of software bundled with hardware not essential to the functionality of the hardware.47"}, "5": {"tables": {}, "text": "the company sells software and peripheral products obtained from other companies. the\ncompany generally establishes its own pricing and retains related inventory risk, is the primary obligor in sales transactions with its customers, and assumes the credit risk for amounts billed to its customers. accordingly, the company generally\nrecognizes revenue for the sale of products obtained from other companies based on the gross amount billed. for sales of third-party software applications for iphone, ipad and ipod touch (\u0093ios devices\u0094) and macs made through the app store\nand the mac app store, the company is not the primary obligor to users of the software, and third- party developers determine the selling price of their software. therefore, the company accounts for such sales on a net basis by recognizing only the\ncommission it retains from each sale and including that commission in net sales in the consolidated statements of operations. the portion of the sales price paid by users that is remitted by the company to third-party developers is not reflected in\nthe company\u0092s consolidated statements of operations.the company records deferred revenue when it receives payments in\nadvance of the delivery of products or the performance of services. this includes amounts that have been deferred for unspecified and specified software upgrade rights and non-software services that are attached to hardware and software products.\nthe company sells gift cards redeemable at its retail and online stores, and also sells gift cards redeemable on the itunes store for the purchase of content and software. the company records deferred revenue upon the sale of the card, which is\nrelieved upon redemption of the card by the customer. revenue from applecare service and support contracts is deferred and recognized over the service coverage periods. applecare service and support contracts typically include extended phone\nsupport, repair services, web-based support resources and diagnostic tools offered under the company\u0092s standard limited warranty.the company records reductions to revenue for estimated commitments related to price protection and for customer incentive programs, including reseller and end-user rebates, and other sales programs and\nvolume-based incentives. the estimated cost of these programs is recognized in the period the company has sold the product and committed to a plan. the company also records reductions to revenue for expected future product returns based on the\ncompany\u0092s historical experience. revenue is recorded net of taxes collected from customers that are remitted to governmental authorities, with the collected taxes recorded as current liabilities until remitted to the relevant government\nauthority.revenue recognition for arrangements with multiple deliverablesfor multi-element arrangements that include hardware products containing software essential to the hardware product\u0092s functionality,\nundelivered software elements that relate to the hardware product\u0092s essential software, and undelivered non-software services, the company allocates revenue to all deliverables based on their relative selling prices. in such circumstances, the\ncompany uses a hierarchy to determine the selling price to be used for allocating revenue to deliverables: (i)\u00a0vendor-specific objective evidence of fair value (\u0093vsoe\u0094), (ii)\u00a0third-party evidence of selling price\n(\u0093tpe\u0094), and (iii)\u00a0best estimate of the selling price (\u0093esp\u0094). vsoe generally exists only when the company sells the deliverable separately and is the price actually charged by the company for that deliverable. esps reflect\nthe company\u0092s best estimates of what the selling prices of elements would be if they were sold regularly on a stand-alone basis.for sales of iphone, ipad, apple tv, for sales of ipod touch beginning in june 2010, and for sales of mac beginning in june 2011, the company has indicated it may from time-to-time provide future\nunspecified software upgrades and features to the essential software bundled with each of these hardware products free of charge to customers. essential software for ios devices includes ios and related applications and for mac includes mac os x and\nilife. in june 2011, the company announced it would provide various non-software services to owners of qualifying versions of ios devices and mac. the company has identified up to three deliverables in arrangements involving the sale of these\ndevices. the first deliverable is the hardware and software essential to the functionality of the hardware device delivered at the time of sale. the second deliverable is the embedded right included with the purchase of ios devices, mac and apple tv\nto receive on a when-and-if-available basis, future unspecified software upgrades and features relating to the product\u0092s essential software. the third48"}, "6": {"tables": {}, "text": "deliverable is the non-software services to be provided to qualifying versions of ios devices and mac. the company allocates revenue between these deliverables using the relative selling price\nmethod. because the company has neither vsoe nor tpe for these deliverables, the allocation of revenue has been based on the company\u0092s esps. amounts allocated to the delivered hardware and the related essential software are recognized at the\ntime of sale provided the other conditions for revenue recognition have been met. amounts allocated to the embedded unspecified software upgrade rights and the non-software services are deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis over the\nestimated lives of each of these devices, which range from 24 to 48 months. cost of sales related to delivered hardware and related essential software, including estimated warranty costs, are recognized at the time of sale. costs incurred to provide\nnon-software services are recognized as cost of sales as incurred, and engineering and sales and marketing costs are recognized as operating expenses as incurred.the company\u0092s process for determining its esp for deliverables without vsoe or tpe considers multiple factors that may vary depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each\ndeliverable. the company believes its customers, particularly consumers, would be reluctant to buy unspecified software upgrade rights related to ios devices, mac and apple tv. this view is primarily based on the fact that unspecified upgrade rights\ndo not obligate the company to provide upgrades at a particular time or at all, and do not specify to customers which upgrades or features will be delivered. the company also believes its customers would be unwilling to pay a significant amount for\naccess to the non-software services because other companies offer similar services at little or no cost to users. therefore, the company has concluded that if it were to sell upgrade rights or access to the non-software services on a standalone\nbasis, including those rights and services attached to ios devices, mac and apple tv, the selling prices would be relatively low. key factors considered by the company in developing the esps for software upgrade rights include prices charged by the\ncompany for similar offerings, market trends for pricing of mac and ios compatible software, the company\u0092s historical pricing practices, the nature of the upgrade rights (e.g., unspecified and when-and-if-available), and the relative esp of the\nupgrade rights as compared to the total selling price of the product. the company may also consider, when appropriate, the impact of other products and services, including advertising services, on selling price assumptions when developing and\nreviewing its esps for software upgrade rights and related deliverables. the company may also consider additional factors as appropriate, including the pricing of competitive alternatives if they exist and product-specific business objectives. when\nrelevant, the same factors are considered by the company in developing esps for offerings such as the non-software services; however, the primary consideration in developing esps for the non-software services is the estimated cost to provide such\nservices over the estimated life of the related devices, including consideration for a reasonable profit margin.beginning\nwith the company\u0092s june 2011 announcement of the upcoming release of the non-software services and mac os x lion, the company\u0092s combined esp for the unspecified software upgrade rights and the right to receive the non-software services are\nas follows: $16 for iphone and ipad, $11 for ipod touch, and $22 for mac. the company\u0092s esp for the embedded unspecified software upgrade right included with each apple tv is $5 for 2011 and $10 for fiscal years prior to 2011. amounts allocated\nto the embedded unspecified software upgrade rights and the non-software services associated with ios devices and apple tv are recognized on a straight-line basis over 24 months, and amounts allocated to the embedded unspecified software upgrade\nrights and the non-software services associated with macs are recognized on a straight-line basis over 48 months.the\ncompany\u0092s esp for the software upgrade right included with each iphone sold beginning with the introduction of iphone in june 2007 through the company\u0092s second quarter of 2010 was $25. beginning in april 2010 in conjunction with the\ncompany\u0092s announcement of ios 4 for iphone, the company lowered its esp for the software upgrade right included with each iphone to $10. beginning with initial sales of ipad in april 2010, the company\u0092s esp for the embedded software\nupgrade right included with the sale of each ipad is $10, and the company\u0092s esp for the embedded software upgrade right included with each ipod touch sold beginning in june 2010 is $5.the company accounts for multiple element arrangements that consist only of software or software-related products, including the sale of\nupgrades to previously sold software, in accordance with industry specific49"}, "7": {"tables": {}, "text": "software accounting guidance. for such transactions, revenue on arrangements that include multiple elements is allocated to each element based on the relative fair value of each element, and fair\nvalue is determined by vsoe. if the company cannot objectively determine the fair value of any undelivered element included in such multiple-element arrangements, the company defers revenue until all elements are delivered and services have been\nperformed, or until fair value can objectively be determined for any remaining undelivered elements. beginning in july 2011, the sale of certain upgrades to mac os x and mac versions of ilife include when-and-if-available upgrade rights for which\nthe company does not have vsoe. therefore, beginning in july 2011 the company defers all revenue from the sale of upgrades to the mac os and mac versions of ilife and recognizes it ratably over 36 months.shipping costsfor all\nperiods presented, amounts billed to customers related to shipping and handling are classified as revenue, and the company\u0092s shipping and handling costs are included in cost of sales.warranty expensethe company generally provides for the estimated cost of\nhardware and software warranties at the time the related revenue is recognized. the company assesses the adequacy of its pre-existing warranty liabilities and adjusts the amounts as necessary based on actual experience and changes in future\nestimates.software development costsresearch and development costs are expensed as incurred. development costs of computer software to be sold, leased, or otherwise marketed are subject to capitalization beginning when a product\u0092s\ntechnological feasibility has been established and ending when a product is available for general release to customers. in most instances, the company\u0092s products are released soon after technological feasibility has been established. therefore,\ncosts incurred subsequent to achievement of technological feasibility are usually not significant, and generally most software development costs have been expensed as incurred.the company did not capitalize any software development costs during 2011 and 2010. in 2009, the company capitalized $71 million of costs\nassociated with the development of mac os x version 10.6 snow leopard (\u0093mac os x snow leopard\u0094), which was released during the fourth quarter of 2009. the capitalized costs are being amortized to cost of sales on a straight-line basis over\na three year estimated useful life of the underlying technology.total amortization related to capitalized software\ndevelopment costs was $30 million, $48 million and $25 million in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.advertising costsadvertising costs are expensed as incurred. advertising expense was $933 million, $691 million and $501 million for 2011, 2010 and 2009,\nrespectively.share-based compensationthe company recognizes expense related to share-based payment transactions in which it receives employee services in exchange for (a)\u00a0equity instruments of the company or (b)\u00a0liabilities that\nare based on the fair value of the enterprise\u0092s equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of such equity instruments. share-based compensation cost for restricted stock units (\u0093rsus\u0094) is measured based on the closing\nfair market value of the

assets is measured by comparison of their carrying amounts to future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate. if property,\nplant and equipment and certain identifiable intangibles

or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market\nparticipants at the measurement date. when determining the fair value measurements for assets and liabilities, which are required to be recorded at fair value, the company considers the principal or most advantageous market in which the company\nwould transact and the market-based risk measurements or assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, such as risks inherent in valuation techniques, transfer restrictions and credit risk. fair value is estimated\nby applying the following hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value into three levels and bases the categorization within the hierarchy upon the lowest level of input that is available and significant to the fair value\nmeasurement:level 1 \u0096 quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.level 2 \u0096 observable inputs other than quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities, quoted prices\nfor identical or similar assets or liabilities in inactive markets, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by

year from the date of purchase by the end-user. the\ncompany also offers a 90-day basic warranty for its service parts used to repair the company\u0092s hardware products. the company provides currently for the estimated cost that may be incurred under its basic limited product warranties at the time\nrelated revenue is recognized. factors considered in determining appropriate accruals for product warranty obligations include the size of the installed base of products subject to warranty protection, historical and projected warranty claim rates,\nhistorical and projected cost-per-claim, and knowledge of specific product failures that are outside of the company\u0092s typical experience. the company assesses the adequacy of its pre-existing warranty liabilities and adjusts the amounts

company\nhas agreed to indemnify such individuals to the fullest extent permitted by law against liabilities that arise by reason of their status as directors or officers and to advance expenses incurred by such individuals in connection with related legal\nproceedings. it is not possible to determine the maximum potential amount of payments the company could be required to make under these agreements due to the limited history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances\ninvolved in each claim. however, the company maintains directors and officers liability insurance coverage to reduce its exposure to such obligations, and payments made under these agreements historically have not been material.concentrations in the available sources of supply of materials and productalthough most components essential to the company\u0092s business are generally available from multiple sources, a number of components\nare currently obtained from single or limited sources, which subjects the company to significant supply and pricing risks. many components that are available from multiple sources are at times subject to industry-wide shortages and significant\ncommodity pricing fluctuations. in addition, the company has entered into various agreements for the supply of components; however there can be no guarantee that the company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms, or at\nall. therefore, the company remains subject to significant risks of supply shortages and price increases that can materially adversely affect its financial condition and operating results.the company and other participants in the mobile communication and media device, and personal computer industries also compete for\nvarious components with other industries that have experienced increased demand for their products. the company also uses some custom components that are not common to the rest of these industries, and new products introduced by the company often\nutilize custom components available from only one source. when a component or product uses new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers\u0092 yields have matured or manufacturing capacity has increased. if the\ncompany\u0092s supply of components for a new or existing product were delayed or constrained, or if an outsourcing partner delayed shipments of completed products to the company, the company\u0092s financial condition and operating results could be\nmaterially adversely affected. the company\u0092s business and financial performance could also be materially adversely affected depending on the time required to obtain sufficient quantities from the original source, or to identify and obtain\nsufficient quantities from an alternative source. continued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at all, may be affected if those suppliers concentrated on the production of common components instead of components customized to\nmeet the company\u0092s requirements.substantially all of the company\u0092s hardware products are manufactured by\noutsourcing partners that are primarily located in asia. a significant concentration of this manufacturing is currently performed by a small number of outsourcing partners, often in single locations. certain of these outsourcing partners are the\nsole-sourced suppliers of components and manufacturer for many of the company\u0092s products. although the company works closely with its outsourcing partners on manufacturing schedules, the company\u0092s operating results could be adversely\naffected if its outsourcing partners were unable to meet their production commitments. the company\u0092s purchase commitments typically cover its requirements for periods up to 150 days.long-term supply agreementsthe company has entered into long-term\nagreements to secure the supply of certain inventory components. these agreements generally expire between 2012 and 2022. as of september\u00a024, 2011, the company had a total of $2.3 billion of inventory component prepayments outstanding, of which\n$728 million are

management\nconsiders the likelihood of such an outcome to be remote, if one or more of these legal matters were resolved against the company in the same reporting period for amounts in excess of

management for making decisions and assessing performance as the source of the company\u0092s reportable segments.the company manages its business primarily on a geographic basis. accordingly, the company determined its reportable operating segments, which are generally based on the nature and location of its\ncustomers, to be the americas, europe, japan, asia-pacific and retail operations. the results of the americas, europe, japan and asia-pacific reportable segments do not include results of the retail segment. the americas segment includes both north\nand south america. the europe segment includes european countries, as well as the middle east and africa. the asia-pacific segment includes australia and asian countries, other than japan. the retail segment operates apple retail stores in 11\ncountries. each reportable operating segment provides similar hardware and software products and similar services. the accounting policies of the various segments are the same as those described in note 1, \u0093summary of significant accounting\npolicies.\u0094the company evaluates the performance of its operating segments based on net sales and operating income. net\nsales for geographic segments are generally based on the location of customers, while retail segment net sales are based on sales from the company\u0092s retail stores. operating income for each segment includes net sales to third parties, related\ncost of sales and operating expenses directly attributable to the segment. advertising expenses are generally included in the geographic segment in which the expenditures are incurred. operating income for each segment excludes other income and\nexpense and certain expenses managed outside the operating segments. costs excluded from segment operating income include various corporate expenses, such as manufacturing costs and variances not included in standard costs, research and development,\ncorporate marketing expenses, share-based compensation expense, income taxes, various nonrecurring charges, and other separately managed general and administrative costs. the company does not include intercompany transfers between segments for\nmanagement reporting purposes. segment assets exclude corporate assets, such as cash and cash equivalents, short-term and long-term marketable securities, other long-term investments, manufacturing and corporate facilities, product tooling and\nmanufacturing process equipment, miscellaneous corporate infrastructure, goodwill and other acquired intangible assets. except for the retail segment, capital asset purchases for long-lived assets are not reported to management by segment. cash\npayments for capital asset purchases by the retail segment were $612 million, $392 million and $369 million for 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.the company has certain retail stores that have been designed and built to serve as high-profile venues to promote brand awareness and serve as vehicles for corporate sales and marketing activities.\nbecause of their unique design elements, locations and size, these stores require substantially more investment than the company\u0092s more typical retail stores. the company allocates certain operating expenses associated with its high-profile\nstores to corporate expense to reflect the estimated company-wide benefit. the allocation of these operating costs to corporate expense is based on the amount incurred for a high-profile store in excess of that incurred by a more typical company\nretail location. the company had opened a total of 19 high-profile stores as of september\u00a024, 2011. amounts allocated to corporate expense resulting from the operations of high-profile stores were $102 million, $75 million and $65 million for\n2011, 2010 and

internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of\nfinancial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with gaap. the company\u0092s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that:pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the\ncompany\u0092s assets;provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with gaap, and\nthat the company\u0092s receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of the company\u0092s management and

the financial statements.management, including the company\u0092s\nchief executive officer and chief financial officer, does not expect that the company\u0092s internal controls will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. a control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable,\nnot absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs.\nbecause of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of internal controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. also, any evaluation of the effectiveness of\ncontrols in future periods are subject to the risk that those internal controls may become inadequate because of changes in business conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.management\u0092s annual report on internal control over financial reportingthe company\u0092s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining
