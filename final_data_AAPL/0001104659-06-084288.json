company\u0092s products.the company believes decisions by customers to\npurchase the company\u0092s personal computers, as opposed to windows-based\nsystems, are often based on the availability of third-party software\napplications such as microsoft office. the company also believes the\navailability of third-party application software for the company\u0092s\nhardware products depends in part on third-party developers\u0092 perception\nand analysis of the relative benefits of developing, maintaining, and upgrading\nsuch software for the company\u0092s products versus software for the

generated, continued acceptance by customers of mac\nos x, and the costs of developing such software products. to the extent the\nminority market share held by the company in the personal computer market has\ncaused software developers to question the company\u0092s prospects in the personal\ncomputer market, developers could be less inclined to develop new application\nsoftware or upgrade existing software for the company\u0092s products and more\ninclined to devote their resources to developing and upgrading software for the\nlarger windows market or growing linux market. the company\u0092s recent\nannouncement that it plans to add a feature to the next version of mac os x\nthat will enable intel-based macintosh systems to run windows xp may deter\ndevelopers from creating software applications for mac os x if such\napplications are available for the windows platform. moreover, there can be no\nassurance software developers will continue to develop software for mac os x on\na timely basis or at all.in june\u00a02005, the company announced its plan to\nbegin using intel microprocessors in its computers. during 2006, the company\nintroduced new intel-based models of the macbook pro, macbook, mac pro, imac,\nand mac mini computers. the company\u0092s transition to intel microprocessors for\nmacintosh systems was completed in august\u00a02006, and its transition for\nxserve was completed in november\u00a02006. the company depends on third-party\nsoftware developers to timely develop current and future applications that run\non intel microprocessors. universal

totaled 39.4 million in 2006, which\nrepresents an increase of 75% from 22.5 million ipod units sold in 2005. strong\nipod sales during 2006 reflected significant sales of both the hard-drive based ipod that supports video,\nfirst introduced in october\u00a0of 2005 and the ipod nano, introduced in september\u00a02005,\nas well as continued expansion of ipod distribution points. during 2006,\nthe net sales per ipod unit sold decreased by 3% compared to 2005 primarily due\nto an overall decrease in average selling prices for all ipods as well as a\nshift in product mix to the ipod nano. from the introduction of the ipod in\n2002 through 2006, the company has sold approximately 68 million ipods.\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 macintosh net sales\nincreased $1.1 billion or 18% during 2006 compared to 2005. macintosh unit\nsales increased by 769,000 units or 17% during 2006 compared to 2005. these increases were mainly due to strong demand\nfor the intel-based macbook and macbook pro systems and reflect a shift in\nproduct mix to portable products in all of the company\u0092s operating segments. net\nsales and unit sales of the company\u0092s portable products increased 43% and 42%,\nrespectively, during 2006 compared to 2005. macintosh desktop net sales and\nunit sales both decreased by 3% during 2006 compared to 2005. the decrease in\nsales of the company\u0092s macintosh desktops was due to declines in sales of the\ncompany\u0092s professional-oriented desktop products. the company believes the\ndecline in the company\u0092s professional-oriented desktop products was due to\ncustomers delaying purchases of such products in anticipation of the release of\nthe intel-based mac pro, which did not begin shipping until august\u00a02006,\nand updated software applications capable of running on intel-based macintosh\ncomputers, and the trend toward portable computers. a slight increase of 1%\nduring 2006 in net sales per macintosh unit sold was due to a shift in mix to\nhigher-priced portable products, partially offset by price reductions on\ncertain macintosh systems.\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 other\nmusic related products and services consists of sales associated with the\nitunes store and ipod services and accessories. net sales of other music\nrelated products and services increased $986 million or 110% during 2006\ncompared to 2005. the increase was primarily due to increased net sales from\nthe itunes store and apple-branded and third-party ipod accessories and\nservices. the increase in sales from the itunes store stemmed from significant\ngrowth in u.s. sales and the opening of the itunes store in japan during august\u00a02005\nand australia during october\u00a02005. the increased sales from the itunes\nstore were also attributable to the availability of videos, television shows,\nand feature-length movie downloads.\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 net sales of software,\nservice, and other sales increased $188 million or 17% during 2006 compared to\n2005. the growth was primarily attributable to increased net sales of applecare protection plan (\u0093app\u0094) extended service\nand support contracts and application software, partially offset by a\ndecrease in sales of mac os x. mac os x\nsales were particularly high in 2005 due to the release of mac os x tiger in april\u00a02005.offsetting the\nfavorable factors discussed above, the company\u0092s net sales during 2006 were\nnegatively impacted by the following:\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 net sales of peripherals and other hardware declined $26 million\nor 2% compared to 2005 primarily due to price decreases and a decrease in net\nsales of displays relating to a shift in mix from desktop to portable systems. the\ndecrease in net sales of displays for 2006 is consistent with the overall\ndecrease in unit sales of macintosh professional desktop systems.55fiscal year 2005 versus 2004during 2005, net\nsales increased 68% or $5.7 billion from 2004. several factors contributed\nfavorably to net sales during 2005:\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 net sales of ipods rose $3.2 billion or 248% during 2005 compared\nto 2004. unit sales of ipods totaled 22.5 million in 2005, which represented an\nincrease of 409% from the 4.4 million ipod units sold in 2004. strong sales of\nipods during 2005 were experienced in all of the company\u0092s operating segments\nand was driven by strong demand for the ipod\nshuffle introduced in january\u00a02005, the release of an updated version of\nthe ipod mini in february\u00a02005, the release of the ipod nano in september\u00a02005,\nand expansion of the ipod\u0092s distribution network. net sales per ipod\nunit sold decreased 32% primarily due to the introduction of the lower priced\nipod shuffle in january\u00a02005 and ipod mini pricing reductions in february\u00a02005.\nfrom the introduction of the ipod in 2002 through 2005, the company had sold\napproximately 28 million ipods.\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 net\nsales of other music related products and services increased $621 million or\n223% during 2005 compared to 2004. the company experienced strong growth in\nsales of ipod services and accessories consistent with the increase in overall\nipod unit sales for 2005. the increased sales from the itunes store were\nprimarily due to substantial growth of net sales in the u.s. and expansion in\neurope, canada, and japan.\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 total\nmacintosh net sales increased $1.4 billion or 27% during 2005 compared to 2004.\nunit sales of macintosh systems increased 1.2 million units or 38% during 2005\ncompared to 2004. the increases in macintosh net sales and unit sales related\nprimarily to strong demand for the company\u0092s desktop products, which was\nexperienced in all of the company\u0092s operating segments. the company believes\nthat the success of the ipod had a positive impact on macintosh net sales by\nintroducing new customers to the company\u0092s other products. desktop demand was\nstimulated in 2005 due to the imac g5 and the introduction of the mac mini in january\u00a02005.\nnet sales and unit sales of desktop products increased 45% and 55%,\nrespectively, during 2005 compared to 2004. macintosh net sales and unit sales\nalso included sales of the company\u0092s portable products, which increased 11% and\n21%, respectively, compared to 2004.net sales per macintosh\nunit sold decreased 7% on a year-over-year basis. the decrease was the result\nof changes in the overall unit mix towards relatively lower-priced consumer\nproducts, specifically the impact of the mac mini product, and desktop and\nportable price reductions. this decrease was partially offset by an increase in\nthe proportion of direct sales.\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 net\nsales of peripherals and other hardware rose by 18% during 2005 compared to\n2004 primarily due to an increase in net sales of displays and other computer\naccessories. net sales of other\nhardware include airport cards and base stations, xserve raid storage, isight\ndigital video cameras, and third-party hardware products.\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 net sales of software, service and other sales\nrose $270 million or 33% during 2005 compared to 2004. this growth was\nprimarily attributable to increased net sales in app extended service and\nsupport contracts, driven primarily by higher associated macintosh computer\nsales. additionally, the company experienced increases in net sales of .mac\ninternet service, professional and consumer applications, third-party software,\nand mac os x that was primarily attributable to the release of version 10.4\ntiger in april\u00a02005.segment operating\nperformancethe company manages its\nbusiness primarily on a geographic basis. the company\u0092s reportable operating\nsegments are comprised of the americas, europe, japan, and retail. the\namericas, europe, and japan reportable segments do not include activities\nrelated to the retail segment. the americas segment includes both north and\nsouth america. the europe segment includes european countries as well as the56middle east and africa.\nthe retail segment operated apple-owned retail stores in the u.s., canada,\njapan, and the u.k. during 2006. each reportable geographic operating segment\nprovides similar hardware and software products and similar services. further\ninformation regarding the company\u0092s operating segments may be found in note 11,\n\u0093segment information and geographic data\u0094 in notes to consolidated financial\nstatements of this form\u00a010-k.americasduring 2006, net sales in the americas segment\nincreased $2.7 billion, or 41%, compared to 2005. the main factors for this\nincrease were significant increases in net sales of ipods, other music related\nproducts and services, macintosh portable systems, and app. sales of ipods\nincreased primarily due to the introduction of the updated ipod with\nvideo-playing capabilities in october\u00a02005 and the ipod nano during september\u00a02005.\nthe increase in other music related products and services was due to increases\nin sales of apple-branded and third-party ipod accessories and sales from the\nitunes store. the increase in sales of macintosh portable systems in the\namericas was due to strong sales of the intel-based macbook and macbook pro\nduring 2006. the overall increase in net sales was partially offset by a\ndecline in net sales of desktops, displays, and mac os x. the decrease in\ndesktop products and displays net sales reflects the overall shift in product\nmix toward portable macintosh systems. mac os x sales decreased from 2005 since\nthe company has not released a new version of mac os x since tiger began\nshipping in april\u00a02005. during 2006, the americas segment represented\napproximately 48% of the company\u0092s total net sales as compared to 47% in the\nsame period of 2005. during 2006, u.s. education channel net sales and\nmacintosh unit sales increased by 13% and 11%, respectively, compared to 2005.\nnet sales from the higher education market grew 22% during 2006 compared to\n2005 due to strong sales of macintosh portable products and ipods. net sales\nwere relatively flat for k-12 due to continued budget constraints.during 2005, net sales in\nthe americas segment grew 64% or $2.6 billion compared to 2004. the increase in\nnet sales during 2005 was primarily attributable to the significant\nyear-over-year increase in ipod sales, sales of other music related products\nand services, and strong sales of desktop and portable macintosh systems. this\nincrease was partially offset by a shift in sales to the retail segment, which\nhad 117 stores in the u.s. and canada as of the end of 2005. macintosh unit\nsales also increased by 30% in 2005 compared to 2004, driven primarily by\nstrong sales of desktop systems largely attributable to strong sales from the\nupdated imac, which began shipping in september\u00a02004, and the mac mini,\nwhich was introduced in january\u00a02005. during 2005 and 2004, the americas\nsegment represented approximately 47% and 49%, respectively, of the company\u0092s\ntotal net sales and represented approximately 48% and 51%, respectively, of\ntotal macintosh unit sales. the company experienced an increase in both u.s.\neducation channel net sales and unit sales of 21% for 2005 compared to 2004.\nstrength in higher education sales related primarily to strong imac and\nportable system shipments. this strength drove year-over-year growth in net\nsales of 32% for the higher education channel during 2005. despite challenges\nin the k-12 market from continued budget constraints and competitive\npressures, the company\u0092s k-12 net sales grew year-over-year by 11% during\n2005 due to increased ibook sales and 1:1 education sales.europeeurope segment net sales increased $1.0 billion or 33%\nduring 2006 compared to 2005. consistent with the americas segment, these\nincreases were a result of strong growth in ipod sales, other music related\nproducts and services, and macintosh portable systems. sales of ipods increased\nprimarily due to the introduction of the updated ipod with video-playing\ncapabilities in october\u00a02005 and the ipod nano during september\u00a02005.\nthe increase in other music related products and services was due to increases\nin sales of apple-branded and third-party ipod accessories and sales from the\nitunes store. the increase in sales of portable systems in europe was due to\nstrong sales of the intel-based macbook and macbook pro that were introduced\nduring 2006. in addition, europe also reported increased sales in app related\nto the increase in macintosh unit sales. these increases were partially offset\nby a decrease in desktop and57mac\u00a0os\u00a0x net sales during 2006 compared to\n2005. the decrease in desktop net sales was due to the shift in product mix toward\nportable macintosh systems. mac os x sales have decreased from 2005 since the\ncompany has not released a new version of mac os x since tiger began shipping\nin april\u00a02005.during 2005, net sales in\nthe europe segment grew $1.3 billion or 71% from 2004. total macintosh unit\nsales in europe also experienced growth during the current year by increasing\n47% in 2005 compared to 2004. consistent with the americas segment, europe\nexperienced strong net sales of desktop products, ipod, other music related\nproducts and services, and software and service sales. demand in europe during\n2005 was particularly strong for the company\u0092s desktop computers, which\nexperienced a year-over-year increase of 56% from 2004. similar to the results\nof the company\u0092s other segments, net sales of ipods, peripherals and software\nwere strong in 2005.japanjapan\u0092s net sales increased $288 million or 31% during\n2006 compared to 2005. the japan segment experienced increased net sales in\nipods, macintosh portable products,\nand other music related products and services. consistent with the company\u0092s\nother segments, japan experienced increases in sales of ipods due to the\nintroduction of the ipod with video-playing capabilities and the ipod nano in october\u00a0and\nseptember\u00a0of 2005, respectively. japan also experienced strong sales of\nthe intel-based macbook and increased sales from the itunes store. these\nincreases were partially offset by decreases in net sales of macintosh desktop\nproducts, displays, and mac os x. the decreases in desktop products and\ndisplays reflect the overall shift in product mix toward portable macintosh\nsystems. mac os x sales have decreased from\n2005 since the company has not released a new version of mac os x since tiger\nbegan shipping in april\u00a02005. total macintosh unit sales during\n2006 remained relatively flat compared to 2005. the relatively flat growth in\nmacintosh unit sales is partially attributable to japan\u0092s overall slow consumer\npc market growth. the company is continuing to evaluate ways to improve its\nindirect and direct channel sales in japan.japan\u0092s net sales and\nmacintosh unit sales were up 36% and 8%, respectively, during 2005 compared to\n2004. japan experienced increased net sales in desktop products, ipod, and\nother music related products and services. desktop net sales and unit sales\nincreased by 31% and 41%, respectively, and ipod sales increased by 220% during\n2005 compared to 2004. the overall increase in net sales was partially offset\nby a decline in portable system net sales during 2005 compared to 2004, which\nthe company believes might have been attributable to a shift in sales from\nportables to the imac g5 and mac mini, and a shift to the retail segment as a\nresult of opening two additional stores in japan during 2005.retailthe company opened 41 new retail stores during 2006,\nincluding a total of 10 international stores in the u.k., japan, and canada,\nbringing the total number of open stores to 165 as of september\u00a030, 2006. this\ncompares to 124 open stores as of september\u00a024, 2005 and 86 open stores as\nof september\u00a025, 2004.the retail segment\u0092s net sales increased by 43% to\n$3.4 billion during 2006 compared to 2005. retail segment macintosh unit sales\nincreased 45% during 2006 compared to 2005.\nwith an average of 142 stores open during 2006, average revenue per store\nincreased to $23.6 million compared to $22.4 million during 2005 and $15.6\nmillion in 2004. the current year increase was primarily due to strong\nsales of macintosh portable and desktop products, ipods, and other music\nrelated products and services. sales of\nipods increased primarily due to the introduction of the updated ipod with\nvideo-playing capabilities in october\u00a02005 and the ipod nano during september\u00a02005.\nthe increase in other music related products and services was due to increased\nsales of apple-branded and third-party ipod accessories. macintosh portable and\ndesktop sales increased due to strong sales of the intel-based macbook, macbook\npro, and imac.as measured by the company\u0092s operating segment\nreporting, the retail segment reported operating income of $198 million during\n2006 as compared to operating income of $151 million during 2005 and58operating income of $39 million during 2004. this\nimprovement was primarily attributable to the impact of opening new stores and\nthe segment\u0092s year-over-year increase in average revenue per store, which\nresulted in higher leverage on occupancy, depreciation, and other fixed costs.expansion of the retail\nsegment has required and will continue to require a substantial investment in\nfixed assets and related infrastructure, operating lease commitments,\npersonnel, and other operating expenses. capital expenditures associated with\nthe retail segment were $200 million in 2006, bringing the total capital\nexpenditures since inception of the retail segment to approximately $729\nmillion. as of september\u00a030, 2006, the retail segment had approximately\n5,787 employees and had outstanding operating lease commitments associated with\nretail store space and related facilities of approximately $887 million. the\ncompany would incur substantial costs if it were to close its retail stores.\nsuch costs could adversely affect the company\u0092s results of operations and\nfinancial condition.gross margingross\nmargin for each of the last three fiscal years are as follows (in millions,\nexcept gross margin

flat\nas compared to 2005. the company experienced more favorable pricing on certain\ncommodity components including lcd flat-panel displays and dram memory and\nhigher overall revenue that provided for more leverage on fixed production\ncosts, offset by an increase in lower margin ipod sales and other music-related\nservices.the company anticipates that its gross margin and the\ngross margins of the personal computer and consumer electronics industries will\nbe under pressure due to price competition. the company expects gross margin\npercentage to decline sequentially in the first quarter of 2007 primarily as a\nresult of a shift in the mix of revenue toward lower margin products such as\nthe ipod and content from the itunes store.the foregoing statements regarding the company\u0092s\nexpected gross margin percentage are forward-looking. there can be no assurance\nthat current gross margin percentage will be maintained or targeted gross\nmargin percentage levels will be achieved. in general, gross margins and\nmargins on individual products, including ipods, will remain under significant\ndownward pressure due to a variety of factors, including continued industry\nwide global pricing pressures, increased competition, compressed product life\ncycles, potential increases in the cost and availability of raw material and\noutside manufacturing services, and potential changes to the company\u0092s product\nmix, including higher unit sales of consumer products with lower average\nselling prices and lower gross margins. in response to these competitive\npressures, the company expects it will continue to take pricing actions with\nrespect to its products. gross margins could also be affected by the company\u0092s\nability to effectively manage product quality and warranty costs and to\nstimulate demand for certain of its products. due to the company\u0092s significant\ninternational operations, financial results can be significantly affected in\nthe short-term by fluctuations in exchange rates.the company orders components for its products and\nbuilds inventory in advance of product shipments. because the company\u0092s markets\nare volatile and subject to rapid technology and price changes, there is a59risk the company will forecast incorrectly and produce\nor order from third-parties excess or insufficient inventories of particular\nproducts or components. the company\u0092s operating results and financial condition\nin the past have been and may in the future be materially adversely affected by\nthe company\u0092s ability to manage its inventory levels and outstanding purchase\ncommitments and to respond to short-term shifts in customer demand\npatterns.gross margin percentage\nincreased in 2005 to 29.0% of net sales from 27.3% of net sales in 2004. the\ncompany\u0092s gross margin during 2005 increased due to more favorable pricing on\ncertain commodity components including lcd flat-panel displays and dram memory;\nan increase in higher margin software sales; a favorable shift in direct sales\nrelated primarily to the company\u0092s retail and online stores; and higher overall\nrevenue that provided for more leverage on fixed production costs. these\nincreases to gross margin were partially offset by an increase in lower margin\nipod sales.operating expensesoperating\nexpenses for

was due primarily to an increase in r&d headcount in\nthe current year to support expanded r&d activities, an increase of $46\nmillion in stock-based compensation recognized as r&d expense resulting\nfrom the adoption of sfas no.\u00a0123r, and higher overall expenses due to the 14th week added to the first fiscal quarter of\n2006 to realign the company\u0092s fiscal quarters with

competitive.selling, general,\nand administrative expense (sg&a)expenditures for sg&a increased $569 million or\n31% during 2006 compared to 2005. these increases are due primarily to

resulting from the adoption of sfas no.\u00a0123r,\na current year increase in discretionary spending on marketing and advertising,\nhigher direct and channel selling expenses resulting from the

in arm holdings plc (arm), akamai technologies,\u00a0inc. (akamai), and earthlink network,\u00a0inc.\n(earthlink). the company sold all of the remaining holdings in these\nnon-current investments in 2004 and 2003. pretax gains recorded upon the sale\nof these non-current investments were $4 million in 2004.interest and other\nincome, nettotal interest and other income, net increased $200\nmillion or 121% to $365\u00a0million during 2006 compared to $165 million in\n2005 and $53 million in 2004. these increases are attributable primarily to\nhigher cash and short-term investment balances and increasing investment yields\nresulting from higher market interest rates and the 14th week added to the first fiscal quarter of 2006. the\nweighted average interest rate earned by the company on its cash, cash\nequivalents, and short-term investments increased to 4.58% in 2006 compared to\nthe 2.70% and 1.38% rates earned during 2005 and 2004, respectively. the\ncurrent year increase in other income was partially offset by higher foreign\ncurrency hedging expenses.interest expense in 2004\nconsisted primarily of interest on the company\u0092s $300\u00a0million aggregate\nprincipal amount unsecured notes, which were repaid upon their maturity in february\u00a02004.\nthe unsecured notes61were sold at 99.925% of\npar for an effective yield to maturity of 6.51%. total deferred gain resulting\nfrom the closure of debt swaps of approximately $23 million was fully amortized\nas of the notes\u0092 maturity in february\u00a02004.provision for\nincome taxesthe company\u0092s effective tax rate for the year ended september\u00a030,\n2006 was approximately 29%. the company\u0092s effective rate differs from the\nstatutory federal income tax rate of 35% due primarily to certain undistributed\nforeign earnings for which no u.s. taxes are provided because such earnings are\nintended to be indefinitely reinvested outside the u.s. in addition, the\ncompany recorded a tax benefit of $20 million due to settlement of prior year\ntax audits in the u.s., and a net benefit of $20 million resulting from the\ndividend repatriation under the american jobs creation act of 2004 (\u0093ajca\u0094) and\ninternational tax planning strategies associated with the repatriation as\nfurther discussed below.as of september\u00a030, 2006, the company had\ndeferred tax assets arising from deductible temporary differences, tax losses,\nand tax credits of $739 million before being offset against certain deferred\nliabilities and a valuation allowance for presentation on the company\u0092s balance\nsheet. management believes it is more likely than not that forecasted income,\nincluding income that may be generated as a result of certain tax planning\nstrategies, together with the tax effects of the deferred tax liabilities, will\nbe sufficient to fully recover the remaining deferred tax assets. as of september\u00a030,\n2006 and september\u00a024, 2005, a valuation allowance of $5 million was\nrecorded against the deferred tax asset for the benefits of state operating\nlosses that may not be realized. the company will continue to evaluate the\nrealizability of the deferred tax assets quarterly by assessing the need for\nand amount of the valuation allowance.on october\u00a022, 2004, the ajca was signed into law.\nthe ajca included a provision for the deduction of 85% of certain foreign\nearnings that were repatriated, as defined in the ajca, within a specified time\nframe. among other requirements, dividends qualifying for the 85% deduction\nmust be reinvested in the united states in certain qualified investments\npursuant to a domestic reinvestment plan approved by the ceo and board of\ndirectors. during 2006, the company repatriated approximately $1.6 billion of\nforeign earnings. of the earnings repatriated, $755 million is eligible for the\nreduced tax rate provided by the ajca. accordingly, the company recorded a tax\ncharge of $51 million related to the repatriation of foreign earnings under the\nprovisions of the ajca. in addition, the company recorded a tax benefit of $71\u00a0million\nresulting from the implementation of tax planning strategies to recognize\ndeferred tax assets that were previously not recognizable within certain\nforeign subsidiaries.the internal revenue service (\u0093irs\u0094) has substantially\ncompleted its field audit of the company\u0092s federal income tax returns for the\nyears 2002 through 2003 and proposed certain adjustments. the company intends\nto contest certain of these adjustments through the irs appeals office. substantially\nall irs audit issues for years prior to 2002 have been resolved. in addition,\nthe company is subject to audits by state, local, and foreign tax authorities. management\nbelieves that adequate provision has been made for any adjustments that may\nresult from tax examinations. however, the outcome of tax audits cannot be\npredicted with certainty. should any issues addressed in the company\u0092s tax\naudits be resolved in a manner not consistent with management\u0092s expectations,\nthe company could be required to adjust its provision for income tax in the\nperiod such resolution occurs.62"

principal67components of this\nincrease were cash generated by operating activities of $2.22 billion, proceeds\nof $318 million from the issuance of common stock under stock plans, and excess\ntax benefits from stock-based compensation of $361 million, partially offset by\ncash used to purchase property, plant, and equipment of $657 million and\nrepurchases of common stock of $355 million in conjunction with net-share\nsettlements on vested restricted stock and restricted stock units. cash\ngenerated from operating activities includes the impact of the $1.25 billion\nprepayment for nand flash memory components. the company\u0092s short-term\ninvestment portfolio is primarily invested in high credit quality, liquid\ninvestments. as of september\u00a030, 2006, approximately $4.1 billion of the\ncompany\u0092s cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments were held by\nforeign subsidiaries and are generally based in u.s. dollar-denominated\nholdings. amounts held by foreign subsidiaries are generally subject to u.s.\nincome taxation on repatriation to the u.s.the company believes its\nexisting balances of cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments\nwill be sufficient to satisfy its working capital needs, capital expenditures,\nstock repurchase activity, outstanding commitments, and other liquidity\nrequirements associated with its existing operations over the next 12 months.capital\nexpendituresthe company\u0092s total\ncapital expenditures were $657 million during 2006, consisting of $200 million\nfor retail store facilities and equipment related to the company\u0092s retail\nsegment, $263 million for real estate acquisitions for the company\u0092s second corporate campus and for a new data center,\nand $194 million for corporate

approximately $360 million for expansion of the company\u0092s\nretail segment, approximately $50 million for real estate acquisitions\nincluding the company\u0092s second corporate campus and its new data center, and\napproximately $265 million to support normal replacement of existing capital\nassets and enhancements to general information technology infrastructure.stock repurchase\nplanin july\u00a01999, the\ncompany\u0092s board of directors authorized a plan for the company to repurchase up\nto $500 million of its common stock. this repurchase plan does not obligate the\ncompany to acquire any specific number of shares or acquire shares over any\nspecified period of time. the company has repurchased a total of 13.1 million\nshares at a cost of $217 million under this plan and was authorized to\nrepurchase up to an additional $283 million of its common stock as of september\u00a030,\n2006.off-balance sheet\narrangements and contractual obligationsthe company has not entered

commitments on noncancelable operating\nleases of approximately $1.2 billion, $887 million of which related to the\nlease of retail space and related facilities. lease terms on the company\u0092s existing\nmajor facility operating leases range from 5 to 15 years.purchase\ncommitments with contract manufacturers and component suppliersthe company utilizes several contract manufacturers to\nmanufacture sub-assemblies for the company\u0092s products and to perform final\nassembly and test of finished products. these contract manufacturers acquire\ncomponents and build product based on demand information supplied by the\ncompany, which typically covers periods ranging from 30 to 150 days. the\ncompany also obtains individual components for its products from a wide variety\nof individual suppliers. consistent with industry practice, the company\nacquires components through a combination of purchase orders, supplier\ncontracts, and open orders based on projected demand information. such purchase\ncommitments typically cover the company\u0092s forecasted component and\nmanufacturing requirements for periods ranging from 30 to 150 days. as of september\u00a030,\n2006, the company had outstanding third-party manufacturing commitments and component\npurchase commitments of approximately $2.3 billion.during 2006, the company\nentered into long-term supply agreements

original condition upon lease termination. as of\nseptember\u00a030, 2006, the company estimates that gross expected future cash\nflows of approximately $19 million will be required to fulfill these\nobligations.other obligationsthe company\u0092s other\nobligations of approximately $39 million are primarily related to internet and\ntelecommunications services.indemnificationsthe company generally does not indemnify end-users of\nits operating system and application software against legal claims that the\nsoftware infringes third-party intellectual property rights. other agreements\nentered into by the company sometimes include indemnification provisions under\nwhich the company could be subject to costs and/or damages in the event of an\ninfringement claim against the company or an indemnified third-party. however,\nthe company has not been required to make any significant payments resulting\nfrom such an infringement claim asserted against itself or an indemnified\nthird-party and, in the opinion of management, does not have a liability\nrelated to unresolved infringement claims subject to indemnification that would\nhave a material adverse effect on its financial condition, liquidity or results\nof operations.69"

of\npresentation and preparationthe accompanying consolidated financial statements\ninclude the accounts of the company. intercompany accounts and transactions\nhave been eliminated. the preparation of these consolidated financial\nstatements in conformity with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles\nrequires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts\nreported in these consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes.\nactual results could differ materially from those estimates. certain prior year\namounts in the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto have been\nreclassified to conform to the current year presentation.typically, the company\u0092s\nfiscal year ends on the last saturday of september. fiscal years 2005 and 2004 were each 52-week\nyears. however, approximately every six years, the company reports a 53-week\nfiscal year to align its fiscal quarters with calendar quarters by adding a\nweek to its first fiscal quarter. the company added this additional week in the\nfirst fiscal quarter of its fiscal year 2006. all information presented herein\nis based on the company\u0092s fiscal calendar.common stock spliton february\u00a028, 2005,\nthe company effected a two-for-one stock split to shareholders of record as of february\u00a018,\n2005. all share and per share information has been retroactively adjusted to\nreflect the stock split.financial\ninstrumentscash equivalents\nand short-term investmentsall highly liquid\ninvestments with maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase are\nclassified as cash equivalents. highly liquid investments with maturities\ngreater than three months at the date of purchase are classified as short-term\ninvestments. the company\u0092s debt and marketable equity securities have been\nclassified and accounted for as available-for-sale. management\ndetermines the appropriate classification of its investments in debt and\nmarketable equity securities at the time of purchase and reevaluates the\navailable-for-sale designations as of each balance sheet date. these securities\nare carried at fair value, with the unrealized gains and losses, net of taxes,\nreported as a component of shareholders\u0092 equity. the cost of securities sold is\nbased upon the specific identification method.derivative\nfinancial instrumentsthe company accounts for its derivative instruments as\neither assets or liabilities and carries them at fair value. derivatives that\nare not defined as hedges in statement of financial accounting standards (\u0093sfas\u0094)\nno.\u00a0133, accounting for derivative instruments and\nhedging activities, as amended, must be adjusted to fair value\nthrough earnings. if the derivative is a hedge, depending on the nature of the\nhedge,77notes to consolidated financial statements (continued)note 1-summary\nof significant accounting policies (continued)changes in fair value will either be offset against\nthe change in fair value of the hedged assets, liabilities, or firm commitments\nthrough earnings, or recognized in other comprehensive income until the hedged\nitem is recognized in earnings.for derivative instruments\nthat hedge the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows that are\ndesignated as cash flow hedges, the effective portion of the gain or loss on\nthe derivative instrument is reported as a component of accumulated other\ncomprehensive income in shareholders\u0092 equity and reclassified into earnings in\nthe same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects\nearnings. the ineffective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative\ninstrument is recognized in current earnings. to receive hedge accounting\ntreatment, cash flow hedges must be highly effective in offsetting changes to\nexpected future cash flows on hedged transactions. for derivative instruments\nthat hedge the exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset or a liability\nand that are designated as fair value hedges, the net gain or loss on the\nderivative instrument as well as the offsetting gain or loss on the hedged item\nattributable to the hedged risk are recognized in earnings in the current\nperiod. the net gain or loss on the effective portion of a derivative\ninstrument that is designated as an economic hedge of the foreign currency\ntranslation exposure of the net investment in a foreign operation is reported\nin the same manner as a foreign currency translation adjustment. for forward contracts\ndesignated as net investment hedges, the company excludes changes in fair value\nrelating to changes in the forward carry component from its definition of\neffectiveness. accordingly, any gains or losses related to this component are\nrecognized in current earnings.inventoriesinventories are stated at\nthe lower of cost, computed using the first-in, first-out method, or market. if\nthe cost of the inventories exceeds their market value, provisions are made\ncurrently for the difference between the cost and the market value. the company\u0092s\ninventories consist primarily of finished goods for all periods presented.property, plant,\nand equipmentproperty, plant, and\nequipment are stated at cost. depreciation is computed by use of the straight-line\nmethod over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which for buildings is\nthe lesser of 30 years or the remaining life of the underlying building, up to\n5 years for equipment, and the shorter of lease terms or 10 years for leasehold\nimprovements. the company capitalizes eligible costs to acquire or develop\ninternal-use software that are incurred subsequent to the preliminary project\nstage. capitalized costs related to internal-use software are amortized using\nthe straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which\nrange from 3 to 5 years. depreciation and amortization expense on property and\nequipment was $180 million, $141 million, and $126 million during 2006, 2005,\nand 2004, respectively.asset retirement\nobligationsthe company records obligations associated with the\nretirement of tangible long-lived assets and the associated asset retirement\ncosts in accordance with sfas no.\u00a0143, accounting for asset\nretirement obligations. the company reviews legal obligations\nassociated with the retirement of long-lived assets that result from the\nacquisition, construction, development and/or normal use of the assets. if it\nis determined that a legal obligation exists, the fair value of the liability\nfor an asset retirement obligation is recognized in the period in which it is\nincurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made. the fair value of\nthe liability is added to the carrying amount of the associated asset and this\nadditional carrying amount is depreciated over the life of the asset. the\ndifference between the gross expected future cash flow and its78notes to

equipment and\ncertain identifiable intangibles, excluding goodwill, for impairment in\naccordance with sfas no.\u00a0144, accounting for the\nimpairment of long-lived assets and for long-lived assets to be disposed of.\nlong-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in\ncircumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. recoverability\nof these assets is measured by comparison of its carrying amount to future\nundiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate. if property,\nplant, and equipment and certain identifiable intangibles are considered to be\nimpaired, the impairment to be recognized equals the amount by which the\ncarrying value of the assets exceeds its fair market value. for the three\nfiscal years ended september\u00a030, 2006, the company had no material\nimpairment of its long-lived assets, except for the impairment of certain\nassets in connection with the restructuring actions described in note 6 of\nthese notes to consolidated financial statements.sfas no.\u00a0142, goodwill and other\nintangible assets requires that goodwill and intangible assets with\nindefinite useful lives should not be amortized but rather be tested for\nimpairment at least annually or sooner whenever events or changes in\ncircumstances indicate that they may be impaired. the company performs its\ngoodwill impairment tests on or about august\u00a030 of each year. the company\ndid not recognize any goodwill or intangible asset impairment charges in 2006,\n2005, or 2004. the company established reporting units based on its current\nreporting structure. for purposes of testing goodwill for impairment, goodwill\nhas been allocated to these reporting units to the extent it relates to each\nreporting unit.sfas no.\u00a0142 also\nrequires that intangible assets with definite lives be amortized over their\nestimated useful lives and reviewed for impairment in accordance with sfas no.\u00a0144.\nthe company is currently amortizing its acquired intangible assets with\ndefinite lives over periods ranging from 3 to 10 years.foreign currency\ntranslationthe company translates the assets and liabilities of\nits international non-u.s. functional currency subsidiaries into u.s. dollars\nusing exchange rates in effect at the end of each period. revenue and expenses\nfor these subsidiaries are translated using rates that approximate those in\neffect during the period. gains and losses from these translations are credited\nor charged to foreign currency translation79notes to consolidated financial statements (continued)note 1-summary\nof significant accounting policies (continued)included in \u0093accumulated\nother comprehensive income\u0094 in shareholders\u0092 equity. the company\u0092s foreign\nmanufacturing subsidiaries and certain other international subsidiaries that\nuse the u.s. dollar as their functional currency remeasure monetary assets and\nliabilities at exchange rates in effect at the end of each \u00a0period, and inventories, property, and\nnonmonetary assets and liabilities at historical rates. gains and losses from\nthese translations were insignificant and have been included in the company\u0092s\nresults of operations.revenue recognitionnet sales consist primarily of revenue from the sale\nof hardware, software, peripherals, digital content, and service and support\ncontracts. the company recognizes revenue pursuant to applicable accounting\nstandards, including american institute of certified public accountants\nstatement of position (\u0093sop\u0094) no.\u00a097-2, software\nrevenue recognition, as amended, and securities and exchange\ncommission (\u0093sec\u0094) staff accounting bulletin (\u0093sab\u0094) no.\u00a0104, revenue recognition.the company recognizes revenue when persuasive\nevidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the sales price is\nfixed or determinable, and collection is probable. product is considered\ndelivered to the customer once it has been shipped and title and risk of loss\nhave been transferred. for most of the company\u0092s product sales, these criteria\nare met at the time the product is shipped. for online sales to individuals,\nfor some sales to education customers in the u.s., and for certain other sales,\nthe company defers revenue until the customer receives the product because the\ncompany legally retains a portion of the risk of loss on these sales during\ntransit. if at the outset of an arrangement the company determines the\narrangement fee is not, or is presumed not to be, fixed or determinable,\nrevenue is deferred and subsequently recognized as amounts become due and\npayable.revenue from service and support contracts is deferred\nand recognized ratably over the service coverage periods. these contracts\ntypically include extended phone support, repair services, web-based support\nresources, diagnostic tools, and extend the service coverage offered under the\ncompany\u0092s one-year limited warranty.the company sells software and peripheral products\nobtained from other companies. the company establishes its own pricing and\nretains related inventory risk, is the primary obligor in sales transactions\nwith its customers, and assumes the credit risk for amounts billed to its\ncustomers. accordingly, the company recognizes revenue for the sale of products\nobtained from other companies based on the gross amount billed.revenue on arrangements\nthat include multiple elements such as hardware, software, and services is\nallocated to each element based on the relative fair value of each element.\neach element\u0092s allocated revenue is recognized when revenue recognition\ncriteria for that element have been met. fair value is generally determined by\nvendor specific objective evidence (\u0093vsoe\u0094), which is based on the price\ncharged when each element is sold separately. if the company cannot objectively\ndetermine the fair value of any undelivered element included in a\nmultiple-element arrangement, the company defers revenue until all elements are\ndelivered and services have been performed, or until fair value can objectively\nbe determined for any remaining undelivered elements. when the fair value of a\ndelivered element has not been established, the company uses the residual method\nto recognize revenue if the fair value of all undelivered elements is\ndeterminable. under the residual method, the fair value of the undelivered\nelements is deferred and the remaining portion of the arrangement fee is\nallocated to the delivered elements and is recognized as revenue.80notes to consolidated financial statements (continued)note 1-summary\nof significant accounting policies (continued)the company records reductions to revenue for\nestimated commitments related to price protection and for customer incentive\nprograms, including reseller and end-user rebates, and other sales programs and\nvolume-based incentives. the estimated cost of these programs is accrued as a\nreduction to revenue in the \u00a0period the\ncompany has sold the product and committed to a plan. the company also records\nreductions to revenue for expected future product returns based on the company\u0092s\nhistorical experience.generally, the company\ndoes not offer specified or unspecified upgrade rights to its customers in\nconnection with software sales or the sale of extended warranty and support\ncontracts. when the company does offer specified upgrade rights, the company\ndefers revenue for the fair value of the specified upgrade right until the\nfuture obligation is fulfilled or when the right to the specified upgrade\nexpires. additionally, a limited number of the company\u0092s software products are\navailable with maintenance agreements that grant customers rights to\nunspecified future upgrades over the maintenance term on a when and if\navailable basis. revenue associated with such maintenance is recognized ratably\nover the maintenance term.allowance for\ndoubtful accountsthe company records its\nallowance for doubtful accounts based upon its assessment of various factors. the\ncompany considers historical experience, the age of the accounts receivable\nbalances, credit quality of the company\u0092s customers, current economic\nconditions, and other factors that may affect customers\u0092 ability to pay.shipping costsfor all periods presented,\namounts billed to customers related to shipping and handling are classified as\nrevenue, and the company\u0092s shipping and handling costs are included in cost of\nsales.warranty expensethe company provides for\nthe estimated cost of hardware and software warranties at the time the related\nrevenue is recognized. the company assesses the adequacy of its preexisting\nwarranty liabilities and adjusts the amounts as necessary based on actual\nexperience and changes in future estimates.software\ndevelopment costsresearch and development costs are expensed as\nincurred. development costs of computer software to be sold, leased, or\notherwise marketed are subject to capitalization beginning when a product\u0092s\ntechnological feasibility has been established and ending when a product is\navailable for general release to customers pursuant to sfas no.\u00a086, computer software to be sold, leased, or otherwise marketed.\nin most instances, the company\u0092s products are released soon after technological\nfeasibility has been established. therefore, costs incurred subsequent to\nachievement of technological feasibility are usually not significant, and\ngenerally all software development costs have been immediately expensed.in 2004, the company began\nincurring substantial development costs associated with mac os x version 10.4\ntiger (\u0093tiger\u0094) subsequent to achievement of technological feasibility as\nevidenced by public demonstration in august\u00a02004 and the subsequent\nrelease of a developer beta version of the product. the company capitalized\napproximately $29.7 million and $4.5 million during 2005 and 2004,\nrespectively, of costs associated with the development of tiger. in accordance\nwith sfas no.\u00a086, amortization of this asset to cost of sales began in april\u00a02005\nwhen the company began shipping tiger and is being recognized on a\nstraight-line basis over a three-year estimated useful life.81notes to consolidated financial statements (continued)note 1-summary\nof significant accounting policies (continued)during 2004, the company incurred substantial\ndevelopment costs associated with filemaker pro 7 subsequent to achievement of\ntechnological feasibility as evidenced by public demonstration and release of a\ndeveloper beta version, and prior to the release of the final version of the\nproduct in march\u00a02004. therefore, during 2004, the company capitalized\napproximately $2.3 million of costs associated with the development of\nfilemaker pro 7. in accordance with sfas no.\u00a086, amortization of this\nasset to cost of sales began in march\u00a02004 when the company began shipping\nfilemaker pro 7 and is being recognized on a straight-line basis over a\nthree-year estimated useful life.total amortization related\nto capitalized software development costs was $17.8 million, $15.7 million, and\n$10.7 million in 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively.advertising costsadvertising costs are\nexpensed as incurred. advertising expense was $338 million, $287 million, and\n$206\u00a0million for 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively.stock-based\ncompensationon september\u00a025, 2005, the company adopted sfas no.\u00a0123\n(revised 2004) (\u0093sfas no.\u00a0123r\u0094), share-based payment,\nwhich addresses the accounting for stock-based payment transactions in which an\nenterprise receives employee services in exchange for (a)\u00a0equity\ninstruments of the enterprise or (b)\u00a0liabilities that are based on the\nfair value of the enterprise\u0092s equity instruments or that may be settled by the\nissuance of such equity instruments. in january\u00a02005, the sec issued sab no.\u00a0107,\nwhich provides supplemental implementation guidance for sfas no.\u00a0123r.\nsfas no.\u00a0123r eliminates the ability to account for stock-based\ncompensation transactions using the intrinsic value method under accounting\nprinciples board (\u0093apb\u0094) opinion no.\u00a025, accounting\nfor stock issued to employees, and instead generally requires that\nsuch transactions be accounted for using a fair-value-based method. the company\nuses the black-scholes-merton (\u0093bsm\u0094) option-pricing model to determine the\nfair-value of stock-based awards under sfas no.\u00a0123r, consistent with that\nused for pro forma disclosures under sfas no.\u00a0123, accounting\nfor stock-based compensation. the company has elected to use the\nmodified prospective transition method as permitted by sfas no.\u00a0123r and\naccordingly prior periods have not been restated to reflect the impact of sfas no.\u00a0123r.\nthe modified prospective transition method requires that stock-based\ncompensation expense be recorded for all new and unvested stock options,\nrestricted stock, restricted stock units, and employee stock purchase plan\nshares that are ultimately expected to vest as the requisite service is\nrendered beginning on september\u00a025, 2005, the first day of the company\u0092s\nfiscal year 2006. stock-based compensation expense for awards granted prior to september\u00a025,\n2005 is based on the grant-date fair-value as determined under the pro forma\nprovisions of sfas no.\u00a0123. the company recognized incremental stock-based\ncompensation expense of $117 million during 2006 as a result of the adoption of\nsfas no.\u00a0123r. diluted earnings per common share was reduced by $0.10 for\nthe year ended september\u00a030, 2006 due to the adoption of sfas\nno.\u00a0123r. in accordance with sfas no.\u00a0123r, beginning in 2006 the\ncompany has presented excess tax benefits from the exercise of stock-based\ncompensation awards as a financing activity in the consolidated statement of\ncash flows.no stock-based\ncompensation costs have been capitalized as of september\u00a030, 2006. the\nincome tax benefit related to stock-based compensation expense was $39 million\nfor the year ended september\u00a030, 2006. as of september\u00a030, 2006,\n$375.2 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to stock options\nand restricted stock units is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average\nperiod of 2.91 years.82notes to consolidated financial statements (continued)note 1-summary\nof significant accounting policies (continued)sfas no.\u00a0123r prohibits recognition of a deferred\ntax asset for an excess tax benefit that has not been realized. the company\nwill recognize a benefit from stock-based compensation in equity if an\nincremental tax benefit is realized by following the ordering provisions of the\ntax law. in addition, the company accounts for the indirect effects of\nstock-based compensation on the research tax credit, the foreign tax credit,\nand the domestic manufacturing deduction through the income statement.prior to the adoption of sfas no.\u00a0123r, the\ncompany measured compensation expense for its employee stock-based compensation\nplans using the intrinsic value method prescribed by apb opinion no.\u00a025.\nthe company applied the disclosure provisions of sfas no.\u00a0123 as amended\nby sfas no.\u00a0148, accounting for stock-based\ncompensation-transition and disclosure, as if the fair-value-based\nmethod had been applied in measuring compensation expense. under apb opinion no.\u00a025,\nwhen the exercise price of the company\u0092s employee stock options was equal to\nthe

by\ndividing income available to common shareholders by the weighted-average number\nof shares of common stock outstanding during the period. diluted earnings per\ncommon share is computed by dividing income available to common shareholders by\nthe weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the\nperiod increased to include the number of additional shares of common stock\nthat would have been outstanding if the dilutive potential shares of common\nstock had been issued. the dilutive effect of outstanding options, restricted\nstock, and restricted stock units is reflected in diluted earnings per share by\napplication of the treasury stock method. under the83notes to consolidated financial statements (continued)note 1-summary\nof significant accounting

(continued)note 2-restatement of\nconsolidated financial statementsthe company is restating its consolidated balance\nsheet as of september\u00a024, 2005, and the related consolidated statements of\noperations, shareholders\u0092 equity, and cash flows for each of the fiscal years\nended september\u00a024, 2005 and september\u00a025, 2004, and each of the\nquarters in fiscal year 2005.previously filed annual reports on form\u00a010-k\nand quarterly reports on form\u00a010-q affected by the restatements have\nnot been amended and should not be relied on.on june\u00a029, 2006, the company announced that an\ninternal review had discovered irregularities related to the issuance of\ncertain stock option grants made between 1997 and 2001, including a grant to\nits chief executive officer (\u0093ceo\u0094) steve jobs. the company also announced that\na special committee of outside directors (\u0093special committee\u0094) had been formed\nand had hired independent counsel to conduct a full investigation of the\ncompany\u0092s past stock option granting practices.as a result of the internal review and the independent\ninvestigation, management has concluded, and the audit and finance committee of\nthe board of directors agrees, that incorrect measurement dates were used for\nfinancial accounting purposes for certain stock option grants made in prior\nperiods. therefore, the company has recorded additional non-cash stock-based\ncompensation expense and related tax effects with regard to past stock option\ngrants, and the company is restating previously filed financial statements in\nthis form\u00a010-k. these adjustments, after tax, amounted to $4\nmillion, $7 million, and $10 million in fiscal years 2006, 2005 and 2004,\nrespectively. the adjustment to 2006 was recorded in the fourth quarter of\nfiscal year 2006 due to its insignificance.the independent counsel and its forensic accountants (\u0093investigative\nteam\u0094) reviewed the facts and circumstances surrounding stock option grants\nmade on 259 dates. based on a review of the totality of evidence and the\napplicable law, the special committee found no misconduct by current\nmanagement. the special committee\u0092s investigation identified a number of grants\nfor which grant dates were intentionally selected in order to obtain favorable\nexercise prices. the terms of these and certain other grants, as discussed\nbelow, were finalized after the originally assigned grant dates. the special\ncommittee concluded that the procedures for granting, accounting for, and\nreporting stock option grants did not include sufficient safeguards to prevent\nmanipulation. although the investigation found that ceo steve jobs was aware or\nrecommended the selection of some favorable grant dates, he did not receive or financially\nbenefit from these grants or appreciate the accounting implications. the\nspecial committee also found that the investigation had raised serious concerns\nregarding the actions of two former officers in connection with the accounting,\nrecording and reporting of stock option grants.based on the evidence and findings from the company\u0092s\ninternal review and the special committee\u0092s independent investigation, an\nanalysis was performed of the measurement dates for the 42,077 stock option\ngrants made on 259 dates between october\u00a01996 and january\u00a02003 (the \u0093relevant\nperiod\u0094). the company believes that the analysis was properly limited to the\nrelevant period. in addition to analyzing all grants made during the relevant\nperiod, the company sampled certain grants between 1994 and 1997 and found none\nthat required accounting adjustments. the first grants for which stock-based\ncompensation expense is required are dated december\u00a029, 1997. the company\nalso examined grants made after the relevant period and found none that\nrequired accounting adjustments. moreover, in the years after 2002, apple made\nsignificant changes in its stock option granting practices in response to\nevolving legal, regulatory and accounting requirements.consistent with the accounting literature and recent\nguidance from the securities and exchange commission (\u0093sec\u0094), the grants during\nthe relevant period were organized into categories based on grant85notes to consolidated financial statements (continued)note 2-restatement\nof consolidated financial statements (continued)type and process by which the grant was finalized. the\ncompany analyzed the evidence related to each category of grants including, but\nnot limited to, electronic and physical documents, document metadata, and\nwitness interviews. based on the relevant facts and circumstances, the company\napplied the controlling accounting standards to determine, for every grant\nwithin each category, the proper measurement date. if the measurement date is\nnot the originally assigned grant date, accounting adjustments were made as\nrequired, resulting in stock-based compensation expense and related tax\neffects.the 42,077 grants were classified as follows: (1)\u00a017\ngrants to persons elected or appointed to the board of directors (\u0093director\ngrants\u0094); (2)\u00a03,892 grants to employees under the monday/tuesday plan\ndescribed below (\u0093monday/tuesday grants\u0094); (3)\u00a027,096 grants made in\nbroad-based awards to large numbers of employees, usually on an annual basis (\u0093focal\ngrants\u0094); (4)\u00a09,988 other grants ratified at meetings of the board or\ncompensation committee (\u0093meeting grants\u0094); (5)\u00a01,082 other grants ratified\nby unanimous written consent (\u0093uwc\u0094) of the board or compensation committee (\u0093other\nuwc grants\u0094); and (6)\u00a0two grants to the ceo (\u0093ceo grants\u0094). all references\nto the number of option shares, option exercise prices, and share prices in\nthis note 2 have not been adjusted for any subsequent stock splits.with the exception of director grants, all stock\noption grants were subject to ratification by the board or compensation\ncommittee at a meeting or by uwc. following approval of the grants at a meeting\nor by uwc, the company\u0092s legal staff would prepare a secretary\u0092s certificate\ncertifying the ratification of the grants. based on the facts and circumstances\ndescribed below, the company has concluded that the recipients and terms of\ncertain grants were fixed for accounting purposes before ratification pursuant\nto parameters previously approved by the board or compensation committee\nthrough the monday/tuesday plan and the focal process. as further discussed\nbelow, within these parameters, management had the authority to determine the\nrecipients and terms for each grant. thus, the company has concluded that the\nmeasurement dates for these grants occurred when management\u0092s process for\nallocating these grants was completed and the grants were ready for\nratification, which was considered perfunctory. with regard to all other\ngrants, the company has concluded that the grants were finalized and the\nmeasurement dates occurred when the grants were ratified. for many grants,\nhowever, the dates of ratification cannot be established because the dates the uwcs\nwere executed by the board or compensation committee members or received by the\ncompany are not available. for such grants, the company has concluded that the\ndate of the preparation of the secretary\u0092s certificate is the best alternative\nfor determining the actual date of ratification.as discussed below, the company\u0092s analysis determined\nthat the originally assigned grant dates for 6,428 grants on 42 dates are not\nthe proper measurement dates. accordingly, after accounting for forfeitures,\nthe company has recognized stock-based compensation expense of $105 million on\na pre-tax basis over the respective awards\u0092 vesting terms. no adjustments were\nrequired for the remaining 35,649 grants. the adjustments were determined by\ncategory as follows:director grants-seventeen director grants were made\nduring the relevant period. two director grants were made pursuant to a 1997\nplan that dated the grants on the enactment of the plan. the remaining fifteen\ngrants were automatically made under the director stock option plan for\nnon-employee directors, which was approved by shareholders in 1998, on the date\nof a director\u0092s election or appointment to the board and on subsequent\nanniversaries, beginning on the fourth anniversary. accordingly, the analysis\ndetermined that the originally assigned grant date for each director grant is\nthe measurement date, and no accounting adjustments are required.86notes to consolidated financial statements (continued)note 2-restatement\nof consolidated financial statements (continued)monday/tuesday grants-beginning in december\u00a01998,\n3,892 new hire grants and grants for promotion and retention purposes (\u0093promotion/retention\ngrants\u0094) were made during the relevant period under the \u0093monday/tuesday plan.\u0094 under\nthe monday/tuesday plan, new hire grants made within pre-established guidelines\napproved by the board or compensation committee were dated on the monday that\nthe recipient started work (or the following monday, if the recipient started\non another day). the company\u0092s analysis showed this process to be reliable with\nvery low error rates. promotion/retention grants, also based on pre-established\nguidelines, were made generally on the first tuesday of each month. the company\nhas concluded that the new hire and promotion/retention grants made pursuant to\nthe monday/tuesday plan within pre-established guidelines do not require\nadjustment, with the exception of six grants that were erroneously dated before\nthe employees\u0092 start dates. for 120 new hire and promotion/retention grants\nmade outside the guidelines, however, the company has concluded that the\nmeasurement dates are the dates of ratification by the board or compensation\ncommittee rather than the dates used for grants within guidelines. accordingly,\nbased on the methodology described above, the company has recognized\nstock-based compensation expense of $6 million from 126 grants.focal grants-during the relevant period, 27,096 focal\ngrants were made to employees typically on an annual basis as part of an\nextensive process that required several months to complete. pursuant to limits,\nguidelines and practices previously approved by the board or compensation committee,\nmanagers throughout the company would make recommendations for grants to\nemployees in their areas of responsibility. after senior management had\ndetermined that the grants were made in accordance with these established\nlimits, guidelines and practices, management treated the grants as final when\nthey were submitted to the board or compensation committee for ratification. the\ncompany has concluded that for 5,595 grants on five dates, the originally\nassigned grant dates are not the proper measurement dates. for these grants,\nmanagement\u0092s process for finalizing the grants was completed after the originally\nassigned grant dates. as a result, the company has recognized $29 million of\nstock-based compensation expense. for two of the five grant dates comprising\n3,744 grants, the evidence shows that the grants were finalized and the\nmeasurement date occurred one day after the originally assigned grant dates. the\ngrants on these two dates represent more than $16 million of the total $29\nmillion of stock-based compensation expense resulting from focal grants.other meeting grants-during the relevant period,\nmeetings of the board or compensation committee were held to ratify 9,988\ngrants that are not monday/tuesday, focal or ceo grants. the grant dates and\nmeasurement dates for these grants are the meeting dates when the grants were\nratified, with the exception of 46 grants. forty-two of these 46 grants are\ndated concurrent with a meeting that considered and approved certain grants,\nbut the evidence indicates that all of the grants may not have been finalized\nuntil a later date. one of the 46 grants was approved and dated at another\nmeeting, but the recipient, who was becoming employed by the company as part of\na corporate acquisition, did not start until a later date. two other grants\nwere approved before the employees\u0092 start dates. another grant was mistakenly\ncancelled and subsequently reinstated, requiring an accounting adjustment.\nthus, for these 46 grants the company has concluded that the originally assigned\ngrant dates are not the proper measurement dates. as a result, the company has\nrecognized $2 million of stock-based compensation expense.other uwc grants-during the relevant period, 1,082\ngrants were approved by uwcs for a variety of purposes, including executive\nrecruitment, retention, promotion and new hires outside the monday/tuesday\nprocess. these grants were not made pursuant to pre-established guidelines\nadopted by the board or compensation committee. therefore, the company has\nconcluded that these grants were87notes to consolidated financial statements (continued)note 2-restatement\nof consolidated financial statements (continued)not finalized for accounting purposes until\nratification by the board or compensation committee. accordingly, for 660\ngrants, the company has concluded that the originally assigned grant dates are\nnot the proper measurement dates. as a result, the company has recognized $48\nmillion of stock-based compensation expense.ceo grants-during the relevant period, the company\nmade two grants to ceo steve jobs. the first grant, dated january\u00a012,\n2000, was for 10 million option shares. the second grant, dated october\u00a019,\n2001, was for 7.5 million option shares. both grants were cancelled in march\u00a02003\nprior to being exercised, when mr.\u00a0jobs received 5 million shares of\nrestricted stock.with respect to the grant dated january\u00a012, 2000,\nthe board on december\u00a02, 1999, authorized a special \u0093ceo compensation\ncommittee\u0094 to grant mr.\u00a0jobs up to 15 million shares. the evidence\nindicates that the ceo compensation committee finalized the terms of the grant\non january\u00a012, 2000, although the committee\u0092s action was memorialized in a\nuwc transmitted on january 18, 2000. because the measurement date is the originally\nassigned grant date, the company has not recognized any stock-based\ncompensation expense from this grant. if the company had determined that the\nmeasurement date was the date when the uwc was executed or received, then\nadditional stock-based compensation would have been recognized.the grant dated october\u00a019, 2001 was originally\napproved at a board meeting on august\u00a029, 2001, with an exercise price of\n$17.83. the terms of the grant, however, were not finalized until december\u00a018,\n2001. the grant was dated october\u00a019, 2001, with an exercise price of\n$18.30. the approval for the grant was improperly recorded as occurring at a\nspecial board meeting on october\u00a019, 2001. such a special board meeting\ndid not occur. there was no evidence, however, that any current member of\nmanagement was aware of this irregularity. the company has recognized $20\nmillion in stock-based compensation expense for this grant, reflecting the\ndifference between the exercise price of $18.30 and the share price on december\u00a018,\n2001 of $21.01.the incremental impact\nfrom recognizing stock-based compensation expense resulting from the\ninvestigation of past stock option grants is as follows (dollars in millions):fiscal\u00a0yearpre-tax\n

distributors and resellers and directly to certain education,\nconsumer, and commercial customers. the company generally does not require\ncollateral from its customers; however, the company will require collateral in\ncertain instances to limit credit risk. in addition, when possible, the company\ndoes attempt to limit credit risk on trade receivables with credit insurance\nfor certain customers in latin america, europe, asia, and australia and by\narranging with third-party financing companies to provide flooring arrangements\nand other loan and lease programs to the company\u0092s direct customers. these\ncredit-financing arrangements are directly between the third-party financing\ncompany and the end customer. as such, the company generally does not assume\nany recourse or credit risk sharing related to any of these arrangements.\nhowever, considerable trade receivables that are not covered by collateral,\nthird-party flooring arrangements, or credit insurance are outstanding with the\ncompany\u0092s distribution and retail channel partners. no customer accounted for\nmore than 10% of trade receivables as of september\u00a030, 2006 or

non-trade\nreceivables from certain of its manufacturing vendors resulting from the sale\nof raw material components to these manufacturing vendors who manufacture\nsub-assemblies or assemble final products for the company. the company\npurchases these raw material components directly from suppliers. these\nnon-trade receivables, which are included in the consolidated balance sheets in\nother current assets, totaled $1.6 billion and $417 million as of september\u00a030,\n2006 and september\u00a024, 2005, respectively. the company does not reflect\nthe sale of these components in net sales and does not recognize any profits on\nthese sales until the products are sold through to the end customer at which\ntime the profit is recognized as a reduction of cost of sales.derivative\nfinancial instrumentsthe company uses derivatives to partially offset its\nbusiness exposure to foreign exchange risk. foreign currency forward and option\ncontracts are used to offset the foreign exchange risk on certain existing\nassets and liabilities and to hedge the foreign exchange risk on expected\nfuture cash flows on certain forecasted revenue and cost of sales. from time to\ntime, the company enters into interest rate derivative agreements to modify the\ninterest rate profile of certain investments and debt. the company\u0092s accounting\npolicies for these instruments are based on whether the instruments are\ndesignated as hedge or non-hedge instruments. the company records all\nderivatives on the balance sheet at fair value.93notes to consolidated financial statements (continued)note

loss on these transactions if\nall counterparties failed to perform according to the terms of the contract,\nbased on then-current currency exchange rates at each respective date.\nthe company\u0092s exposure to credit loss and market risk will vary over time as a\nfunction of currency exchange rates.the estimates of fair\nvalue are based on applicable and commonly used pricing models and prevailing\nfinancial market information as of september\u00a030, 2006 and september\u00a024,\n2005. although the table above reflects the notional principal, fair value, and\ncredit risk amounts of the company\u0092s foreign exchange instruments, it does not\nreflect the gains or losses associated with the exposures and transactions that\nthe foreign exchange instruments are intended to hedge. the amounts ultimately\nrealized upon settlement of these financial instruments, together with the\ngains and losses on the underlying exposures, will depend on actual market\nconditions during the remaining life of the instruments.foreign exchange\nrisk managementthe company may enter into foreign currency forward\nand option contracts with financial institutions to protect against foreign\nexchange risk associated with existing assets and liabilities, certain firmly\ncommitted transactions, forecasted future cash flows, and net investments in\nforeign subsidiaries. generally, the company\u0092s practice is to hedge a majority\nof its existing material foreign exchange transaction exposures. however, the\ncompany may not hedge certain foreign exchange transaction exposures due to\nimmateriality, prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures, or\nlimited availability of appropriate hedging instruments.to help protect gross margins from fluctuations in\nforeign currency exchange rates, the company\u0092s u.s. dollar functional\nsubsidiaries hedge a portion of forecasted foreign currency revenue, and the\ncompany\u0092s non-u.s. dollar functional subsidiaries selling in local currencies\nhedge a portion of forecasted inventory purchases not denominated in the\nsubsidiaries\u0092 functional currency. other comprehensive income94notes to consolidated financial statements (continued)note 3-financial\ninstruments (continued)associated with hedges of foreign currency revenue is\nrecognized as a component of net sales in the same period as the related sales\nare recognized, and other comprehensive income related to inventory purchases\nis recognized as a component of cost of sales in the same period as the related\ncosts are recognized. typically, the company hedges portions of its forecasted\nforeign currency exposure associated with revenue and inventory purchases over\na time horizon of up to 6 months.derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges\nmust be de-designated as hedges when it is probable that the forecasted hedged\ntransaction will not occur in the initially identified time period or within a\nsubsequent 2 month time period. deferred gains and losses in other\ncomprehensive income associated with such derivative instruments are\nimmediately reclassified into earnings in other income and expense. any\nsubsequent changes in fair value of such derivative instruments are also\nreflected in current earnings unless they are re-designated as hedges of other\ntransactions. the company recognized a net gain of approximately $421,000 in\n2006 and net losses of $1.6 million and $2.8 million in 2005 and 2004,\nrespectively, in other income and expense related to the loss of hedge\ndesignation on discontinued cash flow hedges due to changes in the company\u0092s\nforecast of future net sales and cost of sales and due to prevailing market\nconditions. as of september\u00a030, 2006, the company had a net deferred gain\nassociated with cash flow hedges of approximately $2.8 million, net of taxes,\nsubstantially all of which is expected to be reclassified to earnings by the\nend of the second quarter of fiscal 2007.the net gain or loss on the effective portion of a\nderivative instrument designated as a net investment hedge is included in the\ncumulative translation adjustment account of accumulated other comprehensive\nincome within shareholders\u0092 equity. for the years ended september\u00a030, 2006\nand september\u00a024, 2005, the company had net gains of $7.4 million and\n$673,000, respectively, included in the cumulative translation adjustment.the company may also enter\ninto foreign currency forward and option contracts to offset the foreign\nexchange gains and losses generated by the re-measurement of certain assets and\nliabilities recorded in non-functional currencies. changes in the fair value of\nthese derivatives are recognized in current earnings in other income and\nexpense as offsets to the changes in the fair value of the related assets or\nliabilities. due to currency market movements, changes in option time value can\nlead to increased volatility in other income and expense.note 4-consolidated\nfinancial statement details (in millions)other current\nassets20062005vendor non-trade\n

not practicable to determine the income tax liability\nthat might be incurred if these earnings were to be distributed.on october\u00a022, 2004, the american jobs creation\nact of 2004 (\u0093ajca\u0094) was signed into law. the ajca included a provision for the\ndeduction of 85% of certain foreign earnings that were repatriated, as defined\nin the ajca, within a specified time frame. among other requirements, dividends\nqualifying for the 85% deduction must be reinvested in the united states in\ncertain qualified investments pursuant to a domestic reinvestment plan approved\nby the chief executive officer (\u0093ceo\u0094) and board of directors. during 2006, the\ncompany repatriated approximately $1.6 billion of foreign earnings. of the\nearnings repatriated, $755\u00a0million is eligible for the reduced tax rate\nprovided by the ajca. accordingly, the company recorded a tax charge of $51\nmillion related to the repatriation of foreign earnings under the provisions of\nthe ajca. in addition, the company recorded a tax benefit of $71 million\nresulting from the implementation of tax planning strategies to recognize\ndeferred tax assets that were previously not recognizable within certain\nforeign subsidiaries.deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect the\neffects of tax losses, credits, and the future income tax effects of temporary\ndifferences between the consolidated financial statement carrying amounts of\nexisting assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and are measured\nusing enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in the years in which\nthose temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.as of september\u00a030,\n2006 and september\u00a024, 2005, the significant

estimated expected life of the company\u0092s stock options\nand other relevant factors including implied volatility in market traded\noptions on the company\u0092s common stock. the company bases its

leases various equipment and facilities,\nincluding retail space, under noncancelable operating lease arrangements. the\ncompany does not currently utilize any other off-balance-sheet financing\narrangements. the major facility leases are for terms of 5 to 15 years and\ngenerally provide106notes to consolidated financial statements (continued)note 10-commitments\nand contingencies (continued)renewal options for\nterms of 3 to 5 additional years. leases for retail space are for terms of 5 to\n20 years, the majority of which are for 10 years, and often contain multi-year\nrenewal options. as of september\u00a030, 2006, the company\u0092s total future\nminimum lease payments under noncancelable operating leases were approximately\n$1.2 billion, of which $887 million related to leases for retail space.rent\nexpense under all operating leases, including both cancelable and noncancelable\nleases, was $138 million, $140 million, and $103 million in 2006, 2005, and\n2004,

labor\nwarranty on its hardware products. the basic warranty period for hardware\nproducts is typically one year from the date of purchase by the end-user. the\ncompany also offers a 90-day basic warranty for its service parts used to\nrepair the company\u0092s hardware products. the company provides currently for the\nestimated cost that may be incurred under its basic limited product warranties\nat the time related revenue is recognized. factors considered in determining\nappropriate accruals for product warranty obligations include the size of the\ninstalled base of products subject to warranty protection, historical and\nprojected warranty claim rates, historical and projected cost-per-claim, and\nknowledge of specific product failures that are outside of the company\u0092s\ntypical experience. the company assesses the adequacy of its preexisting\nwarranty liabilities and adjusts the amounts as necessary based on actual\nexperience and changes in future estimates.the company periodically provides updates to its\napplications and system software to maintain the software\u0092s compliance with\nspecifications. the estimated cost to develop such updates is accounted for as\nwarranty costs that are recognized at the time related software revenue is\nrecognized. factors considered in determining appropriate accruals related to\nsuch updates include the number of units delivered, the number of updates\nexpected to occur, and the historical cost and estimated future cost of the\nresources necessary to develop these updates.the\nfollowing table reconciles changes in the company\u0092s accrued warranties and\nrelated costs (in millions):200620052004beginning accrued\n  warranty and related costs$188$105$67cost of warranty\n

10-commitments\nand contingencies (continued)the\ncompany generally does not indemnify end-users of its operating system and\napplication software against legal claims that the software infringes\nthird-party intellectual property rights. other agreements entered into by the\ncompany sometimes include indemnification provisions under which the company\ncould be subject to costs and/or damages in the event of an infringement claim\nagainst the company or an indemnified third-party. however, the company has not\nbeen required to make any significant payments resulting from such an\ninfringement claim asserted against itself or an indemnified third-party and,\nin the opinion of management, does not have a potential liability related to\nunresolved infringement claims subject to indemnification that would have a\nmaterial adverse effect on its financial condition, liquidity or results of\noperations. therefore, the company did not record a liability for infringement\ncosts as of either september\u00a030, 2006 or september\u00a024, 2005.concentrations in\nthe available sources of supply of materials and productalthough most components\nessential to the company\u0092s business are generally available from multiple\nsources, other key components (including microprocessors and application-specific\nintegrated circuits (\u0093asics\u0094)) are currently obtained by the company from\nsingle or limited sources. some other key components, while currently available\nto the company from multiple sources, are at times subject to industry-wide\navailability and pricing pressures. in addition, the company uses some\ncomponents that are not common to the rest of the personal computer industry,\nand new products introduced by the company often initially utilize custom\ncomponents obtained from only one source until the company has evaluated\nwhether there is a need for and subsequently qualifies additional suppliers. if\nthe supply of a key single-sourced component to the company were to be\ndelayed or curtailed, or in the event a key manufacturing vendor delays\nshipments of completed products to the company, the company\u0092s ability to ship\nrelated products in desired quantities and in a timely manner could be adversely\naffected. the company\u0092s business and financial performance could also be\nadversely affected depending on the time required to obtain sufficient\nquantities from the original source, or to identify and obtain sufficient\nquantities from an alternative source. continued availability of these\ncomponents may be affected if producers were to decide to concentrate on the\nproduction of common components instead of components customized to meet the\ncompany\u0092s requirements. finally, significant portions of the company\u0092s cpus,\nlogic boards, and assembled products are now manufactured by outsourcing\npartners, primarily in various parts of asia. although the company works\nclosely with its outsourcing partners on manufacturing schedules, the company\u0092s\noperating results could be adversely affected if its outsourcing partners were\nunable to meet their production obligations.long-term supply\nagreementsduring 2006, the company\nentered into long-term supply agreements with hynix semiconductor,\u00a0inc.,\nintel corporation, micron technology,\u00a0inc., samsung electronics co., ltd.,\nand toshiba corporation to secure supply of nand flash memory through calendar\nyear 2010. as part of these agreements, the company prepaid $1.25 billion for\nflash memory components during 2006. these prepayments will be applied to\ninventory purchases made over the life of each respective agreement.contingenciesthe company is subject to certain other legal\nproceedings and claims that have arisen in the ordinary course of business and\nhave not been fully adjudicated. in the opinion of management, the company does\nnot have a potential liability related to any current legal proceedings and\nclaims that would individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse\neffect on its financial condition, liquidity, or results of operations.108notes to consolidated financial statements (continued)note 10-commitments\nand contingencies (continued)however, the results of legal proceedings cannot be\npredicted with certainty. should the company fail to prevail in any of these\nlegal matters or should several of these legal matters be resolved against the\ncompany in the same reporting period, the operating results of a particular\nreporting period could be materially adversely affected.production and marketing\nof products in certain states and countries may subject the company to\nenvironmental and other regulations including, in some instances, the\nrequirement to provide customers the ability to return product at the end of\nits useful life, and place responsibility for environmentally safe disposal or\nrecycling with the company. such laws and regulations have recently been passed\nin several jurisdictions in which the company operates including various\neuropean union member countries, japan and certain states within the u.s. although\nthe company does not anticipate any material adverse effects in the future\nbased on the nature of its operations and the thrust of such laws, there is no\nassurance that such existing laws or future laws will not have a material\nadverse effect on the company\u0092s financial condition, liquidity, or results of\noperations.note 11-segment\ninformation and geographic datain accordance with sfas no.\u00a0131, disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information,\nthe company reports segment information based on the \u0093management\u0094 approach. the\nmanagement approach designates the internal reporting used by management for\nmaking decisions and assessing performance as the source of the company\u0092s\nreportable segments.the company manages its business primarily on a geographic\nbasis. the company\u0092s reportable operating segments are comprised of the\namericas, europe, japan, and retail. the americas, europe, and japan reportable\nsegments do not include activities related to the retail segment. the americas\nsegment includes both north and south america. the europe segment includes\neuropean countries as well as the middle east and africa. the retail segment\noperates apple-owned retail stores in the u.s., canada, japan, and the u.k. other\noperating segments include asia-pacific, which includes australia and asia\nexcept for japan, and the company\u0092s subsidiary, filemaker,\u00a0inc. each\nreportable geographic operating segment provides similar hardware and software\nproducts and similar services, and the accounting policies of the various\nsegments are the same as those described in note 1, \u0093summary of significant\naccounting policies,\u0094 except as described below for the retail segment.the company evaluates the performance of its operating\nsegments based on net sales. the retail segment\u0092s performance is also evaluated\nbased on operating income. net sales for geographic segments are generally\nbased on the location of the customers. operating income for each segment\nincludes net sales to third parties, related cost of sales, and operating expenses\ndirectly attributable to the segment. operating income for each segment\nexcludes other income and expense and certain expenses that are managed outside\nthe operating segments. costs excluded from segment operating income include\nvarious corporate expenses such as manufacturing costs and variances not\nincluded in standard costs, research and development, corporate marketing\nexpenses, stock-based compensation expense, income taxes, various nonrecurring\ncharges, and other separately managed general and administrative expenses\nincluding certain corporate expenses associated with support of the retail\nsegment. the company does not include intercompany transfers between segments\nfor management reporting purposes. segment assets exclude corporate assets.\ncorporate assets include cash, short-term and long-term investments,\nmanufacturing facilities, miscellaneous corporate infrastructure, goodwill and\nother acquired intangible assets, and retail store construction-in-progress\nthat is not subject to depreciation. except for the retail segment, capital109notes to consolidated financial statements (continued)note 11-segment\ninformation and geographic data (continued)expenditures for long-lived assets are not reported to\nmanagement by segment. capital expenditures by the retail segment were $200\nmillion, $132 million, and $104 million for 2006, 2005, and 2004,\nrespectively.operating income for all segments, except retail, includes cost of\nsales at manufacturing standard cost, other cost of sales, related sales and\nmarketing costs, and certain general and administrative costs. this measure of\noperating income, which includes manufacturing profit, provides a comparable\nbasis for comparison between the company\u0092s various geographic segments. certain\nmanufacturing expenses and related adjustments not included in segment cost of\nsales, including variances between standard and actual manufacturing costs and\nthe mark-up above standard cost for product supplied to the retail segment, are\nincluded in corporate expenses.management assesses the operating performance of the\nretail segment differently than it assesses the operating performance of the\ncompany\u0092s geographic segments. the retail segment revenue and operating income\nis intended to depict a measure comparable to that of the company\u0092s major\nchannel partners in the u.s. operating retail stores so the company can\nevaluate the retail segment performance as if it were a channel partner.\ntherefore, the company makes three significant adjustments to the retail\nsegment for management reporting purposes that are not included in the results\nof the company\u0092s other segments.first, the retail segment\u0092s operating income includes\ncost of sales for apple products at an amount normally charged to major channel\npartners in the u.s. operating retail stores, less the cost of sales programs\nand incentives provided to those channel partners and the company\u0092s cost to\nsupport those partners. for the years ended september\u00a030, 2006, september\u00a024,\n2005, and september\u00a025, 2004, this resulted in the recognition of\nadditional cost of sales above standard cost by the retail segment and an\noffsetting benefit to corporate expenses of approximately $663 million, $435\nmillion, and $213 million, respectively.second, the company\u0092s service and support contracts\nare transferred to the retail segment at the same cost as that charged to the\ncompany\u0092s major retail channel partners in the u.s., resulting in a measure of\nrevenue and gross margin for those items that is comparable between the company\u0092s\nretail stores and those retail channel partners. the retail segment recognizes\nthe full amount of revenue and cost of sales of the company\u0092s service and\nsupport contracts at the time of sale. because the company has not yet earned\nthe revenue or incurred the costs associated with the sale of these contracts,\nan offset to these amounts is recognized in other operating segments\u0092 net sales\nand cost of sales. for the year ended september\u00a030, 2006, this resulted in\nthe recognition of net sales and cost of sales by the retail segment, with\ncorresponding offsets in other operating segments, of $159 million and $109\nmillion, respectively. for the year ended september\u00a024, 2005, this\nresulted in the recognition of net sales and cost of sales by the retail\nsegment of $92 million and $64 million, respectively. for the year ended september\u00a025,\n2004, this resulted in the recognition of net sales and cost of sales by the\nretail segment of $54 million and $37 million, respectively.third, the company had opened a total of eight\nhigh-profile stores as of september\u00a030, 2006. these high-profile stores\nare larger than the company\u0092s typical retail stores and were designed to\nfurther promote brand awareness and provide a venue for certain corporate sales\nand marketing activities, including corporate briefings. as such, the company\nallocates certain operating expenses associated with these stores to corporate\nmarketing expense to reflect the estimated benefit realized company-wide. the\nallocation of these operating costs is based on the amount incurred for a high-profile\nstore in excess of that incurred by a more typical company retail location.\nexpenses allocated to corporate marketing resulting110notes to consolidated financial statements (continued)note 11-segment\ninformation and geographic data (continued)from the operations\nof these stores were $33 million, $31 million, and $16 million for the years\nended september\u00a030, 2006, september\u00a024, 2005, and september\u00a025,\n2004, respectively.summary information by operating segment follows

evidence\nsupporting the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial\nstatements. an audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and\nsignificant estimates made by

accordance with the\nstandards of the public company accounting oversight board (united states).\nthose standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable\nassurance about

evaluating\nmanagement\u0092s assessment, testing and evaluating the design and operating\neffectiveness of internal control, and performing such other procedures as we\nconsidered necessary in the

regarding the reliability\nof financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external\npurposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. a company\u0092s\ninternal control over financial reporting includes those policies and\nprocedures that (1)\u00a0pertain to the maintenance of records that, in\nreasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and\ndispositions of the assets of the company; (2)\u00a0provide reasonable\nassurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of\nfinancial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting\nprinciples, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made\nonly in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the\ncompany; and (3)\u00a0provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or\ntimely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the\ncompany\u0092s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.because of inherent limitations, internal control over\nfinancial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. also, projections\nof any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk\nthat controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that\nthe degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.in our opinion, management\u0092s assessment that apple\ncomputer,\u00a0inc. maintained effective internal control over financial\nreporting as of september\u00a030, 2006, is fairly stated, in all material\nrespects, based on criteria established in internal\ncontrol-integrated framework issued by coso. also, in our opinion,\napple computer,\u00a0inc. maintained, in all
