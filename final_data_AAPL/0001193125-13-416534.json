and the company has a\nminority market share in the smartphone market. additionally, the company faces significant price competition as competitors reduce their selling prices and attempt to imitate the company\u0092s product features and applications within their own\nproducts or, alternatively, collaborate with each other to offer solutions that are more competitive than those they currently offer. the company also competes with illegitimate ways to obtain third-party digital content and applications. some of\nthe company\u0092s competitors have greater experience, product breadth and distribution channels than the company. because some current and potential competitors have substantial resources and/or experience and a lower cost structure, they may be\nable to provide products and services at little or no profit or even at a loss. the company also expects competition to intensify as competitors attempt to imitate the company\u0092s approach to providing components seamlessly within their\nindividual offerings or work collaboratively to offer integrated solutions. the company\u0092s financial condition and operating results depend substantially on the company\u0092s ability to continually improve ios and ios devices in order to\nmaintain their functional and design advantages.the company is the only authorized maker of hardware using os x, which has a\nminority market share in the personal computer market. this market is dominated by computer makers using competing operating systems, most notably windows. in the market for personal computers and peripherals, the company faces a significant number\nof competitors, many of which have broader product lines, lower priced products, and a larger installed10"
