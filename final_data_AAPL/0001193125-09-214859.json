operating\nresults. the company expects to experience decreases in its gross margin percentage in future periods, as compared to levels achieved during 2009 and 2008, due largely to the anticipated impact of product transitions, flat or reduced pricing on new\nand innovative products that have higher cost structures, both expected and potential future cost increases for key components, a

operations,\u0094 under the subheading \u0093gross margin,\u0094 which is incorporated herein by reference.the company and other participants in the personal computer, mobile communication and consumer electronics industries compete for various\ncomponents with other industries that have experienced increased demand for their products. the company uses some custom components that are not common to the rest of the personal computer, mobile communication and consumer electronics industries.\nthe company\u0092s new products often utilize custom components available from only one source until the company has evaluated whether there is a need for, and subsequently qualifies, additional suppliers. when a component or product uses new\ntechnologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers\u0092 yields have matured or manufacturing capacity has increased. continued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at all, may be affected if those\nsuppliers decided to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the company\u0092s requirements. if the supply of a key single-sourced component for a new or existing product were delayed or\nconstrained, if such components were available only at significantly higher prices, or if a key manufacturing vendor delayed shipments of completed products to the company, the company\u0092s financial condition and operating results could be\nmaterially adversely affected.the company depends on component and product manufacturing and logistical services provided\nby third parties, many of whom are located outside of the u.s.most of the company\u0092s components and products are\nmanufactured in whole or in part by a few third-party manufacturers. many of these manufacturers are located outside of the u.s., and are concentrated in several general locations. the company has also outsourced much of its transportation and\nlogistics management. while these arrangements may lower operating costs, they also reduce the company\u0092s direct control over production and distribution. it is uncertain what effect such diminished control will have on the quality or quantity\nof products or services, or the company\u0092s flexibility to respond to changing conditions. in addition, the company relies on third-party manufacturers to adhere to the company\u0092s supplier code of conduct. although arrangements with such\nmanufacturers may contain provisions for warranty expense reimbursement, the company may remain responsible to the consumer for warranty service in the event of product defects. any unanticipated product defect or warranty liability, whether\npursuant to arrangements with contract manufacturers or otherwise, could materially adversely affect the company\u0092s reputation, financial condition and operating results.final assembly of the company\u0092s products is currently performed in the company\u0092s manufacturing facility in ireland, and by external vendors in california, texas, china, the\nczech republic and korea. currently, the supply and manufacture of many critical components is performed by sole-sourced third-party vendors in the u.s., china, germany, ireland, israel japan, korea, malaysia, the netherlands, the philippines,\ntaiwan, thailand and singapore. sole-sourced third-party

company has begun to compete with mobile communication device companies that hold significant patent portfolios.\u00a0regardless of the scope or validity of\nsuch patents or\u00a0the merits of any\u00a0potential patent claims by competitors, the company may have to engage in protracted litigation, enter into expensive agreements or settlements and/or\u00a0modify its products. any of these events could\nhave a material adverse impact on the company\u0092s financial condition and operating results.the company\u0092s future\nperformance depends on support from third-party software developers. if third-party software applications and services cease to be developed and maintained for the company\u0092s products, customers may choose not to buy the company\u0092s products.the company believes decisions by customers to purchase its hardware products, including its macs, iphones and ipods, are\noften based to a certain extent on the availability of third-party software applications and services. there is no assurance that third-party developers will continue to develop and maintain applications and services for the company\u0092s products\non a timely basis or at all, and discontinuance or delay of these applications and services could materially adversely affect the company\u0092s financial condition and operating results.with respect to its mac products, the company believes the availability of third-party software applications and services depends in part on the developers\u0092 perception and\nanalysis of the relative benefits of developing, maintaining, and upgrading such software for the company\u0092s products compared to windows-based products. this analysis may be based on factors such as the perceived strength of the company and its\nproducts, the anticipated revenue that may be generated, continued acceptance by customers of mac os x, and the costs of developing such applications and services. if the company\u0092s minority share of the global personal computer market causes\ndevelopers to question the company\u0092s prospects, developers could be less inclined to develop or upgrade software for the company\u0092s products and more inclined to devote their resources to developing and upgrading software for the larger\nwindows market. the company\u0092s development of its own software applications and services may also negatively affect the decisions of third-party developers, such as microsoft, adobe and google, to develop, maintain, and upgrade similar or\ncompetitive software and services for the company\u0092s products. mac os x version 10.5 leopard (\u0093mac os x leopard\u0094), which became available in october 2007, includes a new feature that enables intel-based mac systems to run microsoft\nwindows xp and windows vista operating systems. this feature may deter developers from creating software applications for mac os x if such applications are already available for the windows platform.with respect to iphone and ipod touch, the company relies on the continued availability and development of compelling and innovative\nsoftware applications. unlike third-party software applications for mac products, the software applications for the iphone and ipod touch platforms are distributed through a single distribution channel, the app store. the absence of multiple\ndistribution channels, which are available for competing platforms, may limit the availability and acceptance of third-party applications by the company\u0092s customers, thereby causing developers to curtail significantly, or stop, development for\nthe company\u0092s platforms. in addition, iphone and ipod touch are subject to rapid technological change, and, if third-party developers are unable to keep up with this pace of change, third-party applications might not successfully operate and\nmay result in dissatisfied customers. further, if the company develops its own software applications and services, such development may negatively affect the decisions of third-party developers to develop, maintain, and upgrade similar or\ncompetitive applications for the iphone and ipod touch platforms. as with applications for the company\u0092s mac products, the availability and development of these applications also depend on developers\u0092 perceptions and analysis of the\nrelative benefits of developing software for the company\u0092s products rather than its competitors\u0092 products, including devices that use competing platforms. if developers focus their efforts on these competing platforms, the availability and\nquality of applications for the company\u0092s devices may suffer.18"

developing new digital\nlifestyle consumer and professional software applications; and investing in new product areas and technologies. the company also believes increased investment in marketing and advertising programs is critical to increasing product and brand\nawareness.the company utilizes a variety of direct and indirect distribution channels. the company believes that sales of\nits innovative and differentiated products are enhanced by knowledgeable salespersons who can convey the value of the hardware, software, and peripheral integration, demonstrate the unique digital lifestyle solutions that are available on mac\ncomputers, and demonstrate the compatibility of the mac with the windows platform and networks. the company further believes providing a high-quality sales and after-sales support experience is critical to attracting new and retaining existing\ncustomers. to ensure a high-quality buying experience for its products in which service and education are emphasized, the company continues to expand and improve its distribution capabilities by opening its own retail stores in the u.s. and in\ninternational markets. the company had 273 stores open as of september\u00a026, 2009.the company has also invested in\nprograms to enhance reseller sales, including the apple sales consultant program, which places apple employees and contractors at selected third-party reseller locations, and the apple premium reseller program, through which independently run\nbusinesses focus on the apple platform and provide a high level of customer service and product expertise. the company believes providing direct contact with its targeted customers is an efficient way to demonstrate the advantages of its mac\ncomputers and other products over those of its competitors.\u00a0the company also sells to customers directly through its online stores around the world and through its direct sales force.the company distributes iphone in over 80 countries, through its direct channels, its cellular network carriers\u0092 distribution channels and certain third-party resellers. the\ncompany has signed multi-year agreements with various cellular network carriers authorizing them to distribute and provide cellular network services for iphones. these agreements are generally not exclusive with a specific carrier, except in the\nu.s., germany, spain, ireland and certain other countries.36"

            "text": "the company considers the declines in market value of its marketable securities investment\nportfolio to be temporary in nature. the unrealized losses on the company\u0092s marketable securities were caused primarily by changes in market interest rates, specifically, widening credit spreads. the company typically invests in highly-rated\nsecurities, and its policy generally limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. the company\u0092s investment policy requires investments to be investment grade, primarily rated single-a or better, with the objective of minimizing the\npotential risk of principal loss. fair values were determined for each individual security in the investment portfolio. when evaluating the investments for other-than-temporary impairment, the company reviews factors such as the length of time and\nextent to which fair value has been below cost basis, the financial condition of the issuer and any changes thereto, and the company\u0092s intent to sell, or whether it is more likely than not it will be required to sell, the investment before\nrecovery of the investment\u0092s amortized cost basis. during the years ended september\u00a026, 2009 and september\u00a027, 2008, the company did not recognize any material impairment charges. as of september\u00a026, 2009, the company does not\nconsider any of its investments to be other-than-temporarily impaired.derivative financial instrumentsthe company uses derivatives to partially offset its business exposure to foreign currency exchange risk. the company may enter into foreign\ncurrency forward and option contracts to offset some of the foreign exchange risk of expected future cash flows on certain forecasted revenue and cost of sales, of net investments in certain foreign subsidiaries, and on certain existing assets and\nliabilities. to help protect gross margins from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, certain of the company\u0092s subsidiaries whose functional currency is the u.s. dollar, hedge a portion of forecasted foreign currency revenue. the\ncompany\u0092s subsidiaries whose functional currency is not the u.s. dollar and who sell in local currencies, may hedge a portion of forecasted inventory purchases not denominated in the subsidiaries\u0092 functional currencies. the company\ntypically hedges portions of its forecasted foreign currency exposure associated with revenue and inventory purchases for three to six months. to help protect the net investment in a foreign operation from adverse changes in foreign currency\nexchange rates, the company may enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts to offset the changes in the carrying amounts of these investments due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. the company may also enter into\nforeign currency forward and option contracts to partially offset the foreign currency exchange gains and losses generated by the re-measurement of certain assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies. however, the company may\nchoose not to hedge certain foreign currency exchange exposures for a variety of reasons, including but not limited to immateriality, accounting considerations and the prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures. there can be no\nassurance the hedges will offset more than a portion of the financial impact resulting from movements in foreign currency exchange rates.the company\u0092s accounting policies for these instruments are based on whether the instruments are designated as hedge or non-hedge instruments. the company records all derivatives on the consolidated\nbalance sheets at fair value. the effective portions of cash flow hedges are recorded in other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings. the effective portions of net investment hedges are recorded in other comprehensive\nincome as a part of the cumulative translation adjustment. derivatives that are not designated as hedging instruments and the ineffective portions of cash flow hedges and net investment hedges are adjusted to fair value through earnings in other\nincome and expense.the company had a net deferred gain associated with cash flow hedges of approximately $31 million and $19\nmillion, net of taxes, recorded in other comprehensive income as of september\u00a026, 2009 and september\u00a027, 2008, respectively. other comprehensive income associated with cash flow hedges of foreign currency revenue is recognized as a\ncomponent of net sales in the same period as the related revenue is recognized, and other comprehensive income related to cash flow hedges of inventory purchases is recognized as a component of cost of sales in the same period as the related costs\nare recognized. the portion of the company\u0092s net deferred gain related to products under subscription accounting is expected to be recorded in earnings ratably over the related products\u0092 estimated economic lives beginning when the hedged\ntransactions occur, while the portion of the net deferred gain related to other products is expected to be recorded in earnings at the time the hedged transactions occur. as of september\u00a026, 2009, the hedged transactions are expected to occur\nwithin six months.68"

            "text": "however, the company has not been required to make any significant payments resulting from such an infringement claim asserted against it or an indemnified third-party and, in the opinion of\nmanagement, does not have a potential liability related to unresolved infringement claims subject to indemnification that would materially adversely affect its financial condition or operating results. therefore, the company did not record a\nliability for infringement costs as of either september\u00a026, 2009 or september\u00a027, 2008.the company has entered\ninto indemnification agreements with its directors and executive officers. under these agreements, the company has agreed to indemnify such individuals to the fullest extent permitted by law against liabilities that arise by reason of their status\nas directors or officers and to advance expenses incurred by such individuals in connection with related legal proceedings. it is not possible to determine the maximum potential amount of payments the company could be required to make under these\nagreements due to the limited history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each claim. however, the company maintains directors and officers liability insurance coverage to reduce its exposure to such\nobligations, and payments made under these agreements historically have not materially adversely affected the company\u0092s financial condition or operating results.concentrations in the available sources of supply of materials and productalthough most components essential to the company\u0092s business are generally available from multiple sources, certain key components including but not limited to microprocessors, enclosures, certain liquid crystal displays\n(\u0093lcds\u0094), certain optical drives and application-specific integrated circuits (\u0093asics\u0094) are currently obtained by the company from single or limited sources, which subjects the company to significant supply and pricing risks.\nmany of these and other key components that are available from multiple sources including but not limited to nand flash memory, dynamic random access memory (\u0093dram\u0094) and certain lcds, are subject at times to industry-wide shortages and\nsignificant commodity pricing fluctuations. in addition, the company has entered into certain agreements for the supply of key components including but not limited to microprocessors, nand flash memory, dram and lcds at favorable pricing, but there\nis no guarantee that the company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar favorable terms, or at all, upon expiration or otherwise obtain favorable pricing in the future. therefore, the company remains subject to significant risks\nof supply shortages and/or price increases that can materially adversely affect its financial condition and operating results.the company and other participants in the personal computer, mobile communication and consumer electronics industries also compete for various components with other industries that have experienced increased demand for their products. in\naddition, the company uses some custom components that are not common to the rest of the personal computer, mobile communication and consumer electronics industries, and new products introduced by the company often utilize custom components\navailable from only one source until the company has evaluated whether there is a need for, and subsequently qualifies, additional suppliers. when a component or product uses new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the\nsuppliers\u0092 yields have matured or manufacturing capacity has increased. if the company\u0092s supply of a key single-sourced component for a new or existing product were delayed or constrained, if such components were available only at\nsignificantly higher prices, or if a key manufacturing vendor delayed shipments of completed products to the company, the company\u0092s financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected. the company\u0092s business\nand financial performance could also be adversely affected depending on the time required to obtain sufficient quantities from the original source, or to identify and obtain sufficient quantities from an alternative source. continued availability of\nthese components at acceptable prices, or at all, may be affected if those suppliers decided to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the company\u0092s requirements.significant portions of the company\u0092s mac computers, iphones, ipods, logic boards and other assembled products are now manufactured by\noutsourcing partners, primarily in various parts of asia. a significant concentration of this outsourced manufacturing is currently performed by only a few of the company\u0092s outsourcing partners, often in single locations. certain of these\noutsourcing partners are the sole-sourced supplier of components and manufacturing outsourcing for many of the company\u0092s key products including but not limited to final assembly of substantially all of the company\u0092s portable mac computers,\niphones, ipods and most of the company\u0092s desktop
