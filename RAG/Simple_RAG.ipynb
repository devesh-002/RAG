            "LLMs, or low-latency messaging systems, are critical for applications that require real-time communication and data transfer. In these scenarios, low latency is essential to ensure that messages are delivered quickly and without delay, enabling real-time decision-making and responsiveness.\n",
            "\n",
            "Here are some of the key reasons why low latency is important in LLMs:\n",
            "\n",
            "1. Improved user experience: Low latency LLMs can significantly improve the user experience by reducing the time it takes for messages to be delivered and processed. This is particularly important in applications such as online gaming, video conferencing, and real-time collaboration tools, where even small delays can have a significant impact on the user experience.\n",
            "2. Faster decision-making: In many applications, low latency LLMs enable faster decision-making by providing real-time data and insights. For example, in financial trading, low latency messaging systems can help traders make split-second decisions based on real-time market data, giving them a competitive edge.\n",
            "3. Increased reliability: Low latency LLMs are typically more reliable than high-latency systems, as they are less prone to delays and errors. This is because low latency systems are designed to prioritize message delivery over other factors, such as message size or complexity.\n",
            "4. Better security: Low latency LLMs can also improve security by reducing the amount of time that messages are in transit. This is because messages are delivered more quickly, reducing the amount of time that they are exposed to potential security threats.\n",
            "5. Cost savings: Low latency LLMs can also help organizations save costs by reducing the need for expensive hardware and infrastructure. This is because low latency systems are typically more efficient than high-latency systems, requiring less processing power and bandwidth to deliver messages.\n",
            "\n",
            "Overall, low latency LLMs are critical for applications that require real-time communication and data transfer. By reducing latency, these systems can improve the user experience, enable faster decision-making, increase reliability, improve security, and save costs.\n"

The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing the Company. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to the Company or that the Company currently deems to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect the Company's business, financial condition, and results of operations.\n",

The Company's competitors may have longer operating histories, larger customer bases, more established brand recognition, and greater financial, marketing, and other resources than the Company.

BUSINESS\\n\\n### Overview\\n\\nUber Technologies, Inc. (“Uber,” “we,” “our,” or “us”) is a technology platform that uses a massive network, leading technology, operational excellence and product expertise to power movement from point A to point B. We develop and operate proprietary technology applications supporting a variety of offerings on our platform. We connect consumers (“Rider(s)”) with independent providers of ride services (“Mobility Driver(s)”) for ridesharing services, and connect Riders and other consumers (“Eater(s)”) with restaurants, grocers and other stores (collectively, “Merchants”) with delivery service providers (“Couriers”) for meal preparation, grocery and other delivery services. Riders and Eaters are collectively referred to as “end-user(s)” or “consumer(s).” Mobility Drivers and Couriers are collectively referred to as “Driver(s).” We also connect consumers with public transportation networks. We use this same network, technology, operational excellence and product expertise to connect shippers with carriers in the freight industry.\\n\\n### Segments\\n\\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had three operating and reportable segments: Mobility, Delivery and Freight. Mobility, Delivery and Freight platform offerings each address large, fragmented markets.\\n\\n#### Mobility\\n\\nMobility refers to products that connect consumers with Mobility Drivers who provide rides in a variety of vehicles. Mobility also includes activity related to our financial partnerships offerings.\\n\\n#### Delivery\\n\\nOur Delivery offering allows consumers to search for and discover local restaurants, order a meal, and either pick-up at the restaurant or have the meal delivered. In certain markets, Delivery also includes offerings for grocery, alcohol and convenience store delivery as well as select other goods.\\n\\n#### Freight\\n\\nWe believe that Freight is revolutionizing the logistics industry. Freight leverages our proprietary technology, brand awareness, and experience revolutionizing industries to connect carriers with shippers on our platform, and gives carriers upfront, transparent pricing and the ability to book a shipment.\\n\\nFor more detailed information, you can refer to the full quarterly report.\\n---\\n# Uber Quarterly Report\\n\\n# Uber Technologies, Inc. - Quarterly Report\\n\\nDate: 05/05/2024\\n\\n## Platform Synergies\\n\\n### Massive Network\\n\\nUber\\'s network consists of tens of millions of Drivers, consumers, Merchants, shippers, and carriers across approximately 10,500 cities worldwide. The network is powered by data, technology, and shared infrastructure.\\n\\n### Leading Technology\\n\\nUber has developed proprietary marketplace, routing, and payments technologies that enable efficient operations and service delivery. These technologies include demand prediction, matching and dispatching, and pricing tools.\\n\\n### Operational Excellence\\n\\nRegional operations teams leverage market-specific knowledge to launch and scale products, support various stakeholders, and build relationships with cities and regulators.\\n\\n### Product Expertise\\n\\nUber\\'s products are designed to set the standard for on-demand services, offering a user-friendly interface, evolving features, and ensuring safety and trust for platform users.\\n\\nUber continues to invest in new platform offerings to enhance its services and attract and engage users, ultimately growing its network scale and value.\\n\\n## Membership Programs and Advertising\\n\\nUber offers membership programs like Uber One, Uber Pass, Eats Pass, and Rides Pass to provide discounts, priority service, and exclusive perks to consumers. These programs aim to streamline the user experience.\\n\\nUber utilizes its data and scale to offer marketplace-centric advertising, connecting merchants and brands with its platform network. The number of active advertising merchants grew to over 170,000 in the fourth quarter of 2021.\\n\\n## Competitive Environment\\n\\nUber faces competition globally in mobility, delivery, and logistics industries from existing and emerging players. The company continues to innovate and adapt to stay competitive in these fragmented markets.\\n\\nFor more detailed information, you can refer to the full quarterly report.\\n---\\n# Uber Quarterly Report\\n\\n# Uber Technologies, Inc. - Quarterly Report\\n\\nDate: 05/05/2024\\n\\nTime: 16:31\\n\\n## Competition Overview\\n\\nUber faces competition in various industries including:\\n\\n- Mobility: Competitors include personal vehicle ownership, traditional transportation services, public transportation, and other ridesharing companies.\\n- Delivery: Competes with companies in meal, grocery, and other delivery services.\\n- Freight: Competes with global and North American freight brokers.\\n\\n## Government Regulation\\n\\nUber operates in a complex legal and regulatory environment, subject to laws related to Internet activities, privacy, cybersecurity, data protection, and more.\\n\\n### Mobility Regulations\\n\\nUber\\'s Mobility products are subject to varying laws and regulations in different jurisdictions, creating complexities in operations.\\n\\nRegulations include requirements on licensing, insurance, background checks, and compliance with Transportation Network Company regulations.\\n\\nSpecific regulations like California\\'s Assembly Bill 5 impact how drivers are classified, with ongoing legal challenges and compliance requirements.\\n\\nCalifornia voters approved Proposition 22, affecting the status of drivers as independent contractors.\\n\\nFor detailed information, refer to the full SEC filing.\\n---\\n# Uber Quarterly Report\\n\\n# Uber Technologies, Inc. - Quarterly Report\\n\\nDocument Date: 05/05/2024, 16:31\\n\\nIn the quarterly report filed by Uber Technologies, Inc., the company discusses various regulatory challenges it faces in different jurisdictions:\\n\\n- In London, Uber faced license reviews by Transport for London (TfL) and successfully appealed a decision in 2020.\\n- In Mexico City, regulations were implemented affecting cash payments and driver requirements.\\n- In Barcelona, Uber suspended its Mobility products due to regional regulations.\\n- In New York City, regulations were established for the for-hire market, impacting vehicle licenses and driver pay standards.\\n- Similar regulatory initiatives have been considered in other locations, creating complexities for Uber\\'s business.\\n\\nThe report also highlights the importance of data privacy and protection laws, such as the GDPR and CCPA, impacting Uber\\'s operations globally.\\n\\nFurthermore, Uber addresses the regulatory landscape concerning payments and financial services, including the need for licenses in various jurisdictions.\\n\\nAntitrust scrutiny is another challenge mentioned in the report, with competition authorities closely monitoring Uber under antitrust laws.\\n\\nFor more detailed information, you can access the full report here.\\n---\\n# Uber Quarterly Report\\n\\n# Uber Technologies, Inc. - Quarterly Report\\n\\nDate: 05/05/2024\\n\\n## Intellectual Property\\n\\nUber believes that its intellectual property is essential to its business and provides a competitive advantage.

We are involved in numerous legal proceedings globally, including putative class and collective class action lawsuits, demands for arbitration, charges and claims before administrative agencies, and investigations or audits by labor, social security, and tax authorities that claim that Drivers should be treated as our employees (or as workers or quasi-employees where those statuses exist), rather than as independent contractors.\\n\\nWe believe that Drivers are independent contractors because, among other things, they can choose whether, when, and where to provide services on our platform, are free to provide services on our competitors’ platforms, and provide a vehicle to perform services on our platform. Nevertheless, we may not be successful in defending the classification of Drivers in some or all jurisdictions. Furthermore, the costs associated with defending, settling, or resolving pending and future lawsuits (including demands for arbitration) relating to the classification of Drivers have been and may continue to be material to our business.\\n\\nIn addition, more than 150,000 Drivers in the United States who have entered into arbitration agreements with us have filed (or\\n\\nSource: SEC Filing\\n---\\n# Uber Quarterly Report\\n\\n# Uber Quarterly Report\\n\\nDate: 05/05/2024, 16:31\\n\\nFiled with SEC: uber-20211231\\n\\n...\\n\\nExpressed an intention to file) arbitration demands against us that assert similar classification claims. We have resolved the classification claims of a majority of these Drivers under individual settlement agreements, pursuant to which we have paid approximately $372 million as of December 31, 2021. Furthermore, we are involved in numerous legal proceedings regarding the enforceability of arbitration agreements entered into with Drivers. If we are not successful in such proceedings, this could negatively impact the enforceability of arbitration agreements in other legal proceedings, which could have an adverse consequence on our business and financial condition.\\n\\nChanges to foreign, state, and local laws governing the definition or classification of independent contractors, or judicial decisions regarding independent contractor classification, could require classification of Drivers as employees (or workers or quasi-employees where those statuses exist) and/or representation of Drivers by labor unions. For example, California’s Assembly Bill 5 became effective as of January 1, 2020. Government authorities and private plaintiffs have brought litigation asserting that Assembly Bill 5 requires Drivers in California to be classified as employees. For example, in May 2020, the California Attorney General, in conjunction with the city attorneys for San Francisco, Los Angeles and San Diego, filed a complaint against Uber and Lyft, alleging that drivers are misclassified, and sought an injunction and monetary damages related to the alleged competitive advantage caused by the alleged misclassification of drivers. In August 2020, the San Francisco Superior Court issued a preliminary injunction enjoining Uber and Lyft from classifying drivers as independent contractors during the pendency of the lawsuit, and while the California Court of Appeal subsequently affirmed the lower court’s ruling, on April 12, 2021, the parties filed a stipulation to dissolve the injunction, which was granted on April 16, 2021.\\n\\nIn November 2020, California voters approved Proposition 22, a California state ballot initiative that provides a framework for drivers that use platforms like ours for independent work. Proposition 22 went into effect in December 2020 and we expect that Drivers will be able to maintain their status as independent contractors under California law and that we and our competitors will be required to comply with the provisions of Proposition 22. Although our stipulation to dissolve the California Attorney General’s preliminary injunction was granted in April 2021, that litigation remains pending, and we also may face liability relating to periods before the effective date of Proposition 22. Legal challenges to Proposition 22 have been and may continue to be filed.\\n\\n...\\n\\nFor more information, you can access the full document here.\\n---\\n# Uber Quarterly Report\\n\\n# Uber Technologies, Inc. - Quarterly Report\\n\\nDate: 05/05/2024\\n\\n## Competition Analysis\\n\\nThe mobility, delivery, and logistics industries are highly competitive with well-established alternatives, low barriers to entry, and intense competition globally.

Changes in Driver qualification and background-check requirements may increase costs and reduce the ability to onboard additional Drivers. Allegations have been made that our background check process is insufficient. Legislators and regulators may impose new requirements, impacting our business and growth.\\n\\nMaintaining and enhancing our brand and reputation is critical to our business prospects. Negative media coverage and publicity have affected our brand and reputation in the past. Adverse events could harm our brand and reputation, affecting our financial results and future prospects. Our brand and reputation could also be impacted by events outside of our control, such as incidents involving safety or privacy violations by third parties.\\n\\nThe successful rehabilitation of our brand depends on maintaining a good reputation, minimizing safety incidents, improving workplace practices, compliance programs, service quality, and ethical behavior. Competitors expanding their offerings may make it more challenging and expensive to maintain and enhance our brand and reputation. Failure to do so could further damage our business.\\n\\nLink to full report\\n---\\n# Uber Quarterly Report\\n\\n# Uber Technologies, Inc. - Quarterly Report\\n\\nBelow are some key points extracted from the quarterly report filed by Uber Technologies, Inc. with the Securities and Exchange Commission:\\n\\n## Operational, Compliance, and Cultural Challenges\\n\\nUber acknowledges that its historical workplace culture and approach have created operational, compliance, and cultural challenges that could adversely impact its business, financial condition, operating results, and prospects. Efforts have been made to address these challenges, including changes in cultural values and leadership composition.\\n\\n## Workforce and Operations Growth\\n\\nUber has experienced substantial growth in its global workforce and operations. Managing this growth effectively is crucial for the company\\'s financial performance and future prospects. Challenges include optimizing organizational structure, managing growth, and implementing reductions in the workforce.\\n\\n## Technology and Infrastructure Upgrades\\n\\nFailure to upgrade technology and network infrastructure could lead to system disruptions and poor user experiences. Uber recognizes the need to commit substantial resources to improve technology, operational systems, and controls to support its business operations and growth.\\n\\n## Organizational Structure Complexity\\n\\nUber\\'s complex organizational structure will continue to grow as it expands globally and adds new elements to its platform. Effective management of this growth is essential to maintain platform quality, address competitive challenges, and ensure overall business success.\\n\\nFor more detailed information, you can access the full report here.\\n---\\n# Uber Quarterly Report\\n\\n# Uber Technologies, Inc. - Quarterly Report\\n\\nIf platform users engage in, or are subject to, criminal, violent, inappropriate, or dangerous activity that results in major safety incidents, our ability to attract and retain Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, and carriers may be harmed, which could have an adverse impact on our reputation, business, financial condition, and operating results.\\n\\nWe are not able to control or predict the actions of platform users and third parties, either during their use of our platform or otherwise, and we may be unable to protect or provide a safe environment for Drivers and consumers as a result of certain actions by Drivers, consumers, merchants, carriers, and third parties. Such actions may result in injuries, property damage, or loss of life for consumers and third parties, or business interruption, brand and reputational damage, or significant liabilities for us. Although we administer certain qualification processes for users of our platform, including background checks on Drivers through third-party service providers, these qualification processes and background checks may not expose all potentially relevant information and are limited in certain jurisdictions according to national and local laws, and our third-party service providers may fail to conduct such background checks adequately or disclose information that could be relevant to a determination of eligibility. Further, the qualification and background check standards for Couriers are generally less extensive than those conducted for Mobility Drivers. In addition, we do not independently test Drivers’ driving skills. Consequently, we expect to continue to receive complaints from riders and other consumers, as well as actual or threatened legal action against us related to Driver conduct. We have also faced civil litigation alleging, among other things, inadequate Driver qualification processes and background checks, and general misrepresentations regarding the safety of our platform.\\n\\nIf Drivers or carriers, or individuals impersonating Drivers or carriers, engage in criminal activity, misconduct, or inappropriate conduct or use our platform as a conduit for criminal activity, consumers and shippers may not consider our products and offerings safe, and we may receive negative press coverage as a result of our business relationship with such Driver or carrier, which would adversely impact our brand, reputation, and business. There have been numerous incidents and allegations worldwide of Drivers, or individuals impersonating Drivers, sexually assaulting, abusing, kidnapping and/or fatally injuring consumers, or otherwise engaging in criminal activity while using our platform or claiming to use our platform. Furthermore, if consumers engage in criminal activity or misconduct while using our platform, Drivers and merchants may be unwilling to continue using our platform. In addition, certain regions where we operate have high rates of violent crime, which has impacted Drivers and consumers in those regions. For example, in Latin America, there have been numerous and increasing reports of Drivers and consumers being victimized by violent crime, such as armed robbery, violent assault, and rape, while taking or providing a trip on our platform. If other criminal, inappropriate, or other negative incidents occur due to the conduct of platform users or third parties, our ability to attract platform users may be harmed, and our business and financial results could be adversely affected.\\n\\nPublic reporting or disclosure of reported safety information, including information about safety incidents reportedly occurring on or related to our platform, whether generated by us or third parties such as media or regulators, may adversely impact our business and financial results.\\n\\nFurther, we may be subject to claims of significant liability based on traffic accidents, deaths, injuries, or other incidents that are caused by Drivers, consumers, or third parties while using our platform, or even when Drivers, consumers, or third parties are not actively using our platform. On a smaller scale, we may face litigation related to claims by Drivers for the actions of consumers or third parties. Furthermore, operating a motor vehicle is inherently dangerous. In addition, the growth of our Delivery offering has led to an increase in Couriers on two-wheel vehicles such as scooters and bicycles, who are more vulnerable road users and face a more severe level of injury in the event of a collision than that faced while driving in a vehicle. For example, urban hazards such as unpaved or uneven roadways increase the risk and severity of potential injuries. In addition, Couriers, in particular those on two-wheel vehicles predominantly in metropolitan areas, need to share, navigate, and at times contend with narrow and heavily congested roads occupied by cars, buses, and light rail, especially during “rush” hours, all of which heighten the potential risk of injuries or death. Our auto liability and general liability insurance policies may not cover all potential claims to which we are exposed, and may not be adequate to indemnify us for all liability. These incidents may subject us to liability and negative publicity, which would increase our operating costs and adversely affect our business, operating results, and future prospects. Even if these claims do not result in liability, we will incur significant costs in investigating and defending against them. As we expand our products and offerings, such as Freight, this insurance risk will grow.\\n\\nWe are making substantial investments in new offerings and technologies, and may increase such investments in the future. These new ventures are inherently risky, and we may never realize any expected benefits from them.\\n\\nWe have made substantial investments to develop new offerings and technologies, and we intend to continue investing significant resources in developing new technologies, tools, features, services, products, and offerings. For example, through our acquisition of Cornershop, a provider of online grocery delivery in several countries including Mexico and Chile, we expanded our Delivery offering to grocery delivery. Additionally, in October 2021, we acquired The Drizly Group, Inc., which operates an on-demand alcohol marketplace in North America, in order to further expand our Delivery offering to alcohol. We also plan to invest significant resources to develop and expand new offerings and technologies in the markets in which Careem and Postmates operate. If we do not spend our development budget efficiently or effectively on commercially successful and innovative technologies, we may not realize the expected benefits of our strategy. Our new initiatives also have a high degree of risk, as each involves nascent industries and unproven business strategies and technologies with which we have limited or no prior development or operating experience. Because such\\n\\nSource\\n---\\n# Uber Quarterly Report - Q4 2021\\n\\n# Uber Quarterly Report - Q4 2021\\n\\nOfferings and technologies are new, they will likely involve claims and liabilities (including, but not limited to, personal injury claims), expenses, regulatory challenges, and other risks, some of which we do not currently anticipate. There can be no assurance that consumer demand for such initiatives will exist or be sustained at the levels that we anticipate, or that any of these initiatives will gain sufficient traction or market acceptance to generate sufficient revenue to offset any new expenses or liabilities associated with these new investments. It is also possible that products and offerings developed by others will render our products and offerings noncompetitive or obsolete. Further, our development efforts with respect to new products, offerings and technologies could distract management from current operations, and will divert capital and other resources from our more established products, offerings and technologies. Even if we are successful in developing new products, offerings or technologies, regulatory authorities may subject us to new rules or restrictions in response to our innovations that could increase our expenses or prevent us from successfully commercializing new products, offerings or technologies. If we do not realize the expected benefits of our investments, our business, financial condition, operating results, and prospects may be harmed.\\n\\nOur business is substantially dependent on operations outside the United States, including those in markets in which we have limited experience, and if we are unable to manage the risks presented by our business model internationally, our financial results and future prospects will be adversely impacted. As of December 31, 2021, we operated in approximately 72 countries, and markets outside the United States accounted for approximately 78% of all Trips. We have limited experience operating in many jurisdictions outside of the United States and have made, and expect to continue to make, significant investments to expand our international operations and compete with local and other global competitors. For example, our acquisitions of Careem and Cornershop may not be successful and may negatively affect our operating results.\\n\\nConducting our business internationally, particularly in countries in which we have limited experience, subjects us to risks that we do not face to the same degree in the United States. These risks include, among others:\\n\\n- Operational and compliance challenges caused by distance, language, and cultural differences\\n- The resources required to localize our business, which requires the translation of our mobile app and website into foreign languages and the adaptation of our operations to local practices, laws, and regulations and any changes in such practices, laws, and regulations\\n- Laws and regulations more restrictive than those in the United States, including laws governing competition, pricing, payment methods, Internet activities, transportation services, logistics services, payment processing, real estate tenancy laws, tax and social security laws, employment and labor laws, driver screening and background checks, licensing regulations, email messaging, privacy, location services, collection, use, processing, or sharing of personal information, ownership of intellectual property, and other activities important to our business\\n- Competition with companies or other services that understand local markets better than we do, that have pre-existing relationships with potential platform users in those markets, or that are favored by government or regulatory authorities in those markets\\n- Differing levels of social acceptance of our brand, products, and offerings\\n- Differing levels of technological compatibility with our platform\\n- Exposure to business cultures in which improper business practices may be prevalent\\n- Legal uncertainty regarding our liability for the actions of platform users and third parties, including uncertainty resulting from unique local laws or a lack of clear legal precedent\\n- Difficulties in managing, growing, and staffing international operations, including in countries in which foreign employees may become part of labor unions, employee representative bodies, or collective bargaining agreements, and challenges relating to work stoppages or slowdowns\\n- Fluctuations in currency exchange rates\\n- Managing operations in markets in which cash transactions are favored over credit or debit cards\\n- Regulations governing the control of local currencies that impact our ability to collect fares on behalf of Drivers and remit those funds to Drivers in the same currencies, as well as higher levels of credit risk and payment fraud\\n- Adverse tax consequences, including the complexities of foreign value added and digital services tax systems, and restrictions on the repatriation of earnings\\n- Increased financial accounting and reporting burdens, and complexities associated with implementing and maintaining adequate internal controls\\n\\nSource\\n---\\n# Uber Quarterly Report\\n\\n# Uber Technologies, Inc. - Quarterly Report\\n\\nDate: 05/05/2024, 16:31\\n\\nDifficulties and Risks:\\n\\n- Difficulties in implementing and maintaining financial systems for compliance\\n- Import and export restrictions\\n- Political, social, and economic instability abroad\\n- Public health concerns like COVID-19\\n- Reduced protection for intellectual property rights\\n\\nImpact on International Operations:\\n\\nThe risks mentioned could adversely affect international operations, leading to negative impacts on business, financial condition, and operating results.\\n\\nRisks from Minority-Owned Affiliates:\\n\\nLimited influence over minority-owned affiliates poses risks including potential loss of value.\\n\\nGrowth Strategy and Ownership:\\n\\nUber\\'s growth strategy involves divesting businesses in certain jurisdictions, partnering with local companies, and holding minority ownership positions in entities like Didi, Grab, Zomato, etc.\\n\\nChallenges with Minority Ownership:\\n\\nUber faces challenges with minority ownership positions in terms of control over management decisions, potential disagreements, and competition in various markets.\\n\\nFluctuations in Operating Results:\\n\\nUber may experience significant fluctuations in operating results, impacting profitability and investor value.\\n\\nFor more details, you can access the full report here.\\n---\\n# Uber Quarterly Report\\n\\n# Uber Quarterly Report\\n\\nDate: 05/05/2024, 16:31\\n\\nOur operating results may vary significantly and are not necessarily an indication of future performance. These fluctuations may be a result of a variety of factors, some of which are beyond our control, such as the current COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, we experience seasonal fluctuations in our financial results. For Mobility, we typically generate higher revenue in our fourth quarter compared to other quarters due in part to fourth quarter holiday and business demand, and typically generate lower revenue in our third quarter compared to other quarters due in part to less usage of our platform during peak vacation season in certain cities, such as Paris. We have typically experienced lower quarter-over-quarter growth in Mobility in the first quarter. In 2021, we experienced less seasonality as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and related restrictions, which altered typical travel patterns. For Delivery, we expect to experience seasonal increases in our revenue in the first and fourth quarters compared to the second and third quarters, although the historical growth of Delivery has masked these seasonal fluctuations; however, in 2021, we experienced less seasonality as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and related restrictions, which accelerated the growth of Delivery in 2021 as cities imposed dining restrictions and shelter in place orders. Our growth has made, and may in the future make, seasonal fluctuations difficult to detect. We expect these seasonal trends to become more pronounced over time as our growth slows. Other seasonal trends may develop or these existing seasonal trends may become more extreme, which would contribute to fluctuations in our operating results. In addition to seasonality, our operating results may fluctuate as a result of factors including our ability to attract and retain new platform users, increased competition in the markets in which we operate, our ability to expand our operations in new and existing markets, our ability to maintain an adequate growth rate and effectively manage that growth, our ability to keep pace with technological changes in the industries in which we operate, changes in governmental or other regulations affecting our business, harm to our brand or reputation, and other risks described elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. As such, we may not accurately forecast our operating results. We base our expense levels and investment plans on estimates, which has become more challenging in light of the COVID-19 pandemic. A significant portion of our expenses and investments are fixed, and we may not be able to adjust our spending quickly enough if our revenue is less than expected, resulting in losses that exceed our expectations. If we are unable to achieve sustained profits, our prospects would be adversely affected and investors may lose some or all of the value of their investment.\\n\\nIf our growth slows more significantly than we currently expect, we may not be able to achieve profitability, which would adversely affect our financial results and future prospects. Our Gross Bookings and revenue growth rates (in particular with respect to our ridesharing products) have slowed in recent periods, and we expect that they will continue to slow in the future. We believe that our growth depends on a number of factors, including the duration and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic and our ability to:\\n\\n- grow supply and demand on our platform;\\n- increase existing platform users’ activity on our platform;\\n- continue to introduce our platform to new markets;\\n- provide high-quality support to Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, and carriers;\\n- expand our business and increase our market share and category position;\\n- compete with the products and offerings of, and pricing and incentives offered by, our competitors;\\n- develop new products, offerings, and technologies;\\n- identify and acquire or invest in businesses, products, offerings, or technologies that we believe could complement or expand our platform;\\n- penetrate suburban and rural areas and increase the number of rides taken on our platform outside metropolitan areas;\\n- reduce the costs of our Mobility offering to better compete with personal vehicle ownership and usage and other low-cost alternatives like public transportation, which in many cases can be faster or cheaper than any other form of transportation;\\n- maintain existing local regulations in key markets where we operate;\\n- enter or expand operations in some of the key countries in which we are currently limited by local regulations, such as Argentina, Germany, Italy, Japan, South Korea, and Spain; and\\n- increase positive perception of our brand.\\n\\nWe may not successfully accomplish any of these objectives. In addition, circumstances that have accelerated the growth of our Delivery offering stemming from continued stay-at-home order demand related to COVID-19 may not continue in the future. A softening of Driver, consumer, merchant, shipper, or carrier demand, whether caused by changes in the preferences of such parties, failure to maintain our brand, changes in the U.S. or global economies, licensing fees in various jurisdictions, competition, or other factors, may result in decreased revenue or growth and our financial results and future prospects would be adversely impacted. We expect to continue to incur significant expenses, and if we cannot increase our revenue at a faster rate than the increase in our expenses, we will not achieve profitability.\\n\\nSource: SEC Filing\\n---\\n# Uber Quarterly Report\\n\\n# Uber Technologies, Inc. - Quarterly Report\\n\\nDate: 05/05/2024, 16:31\\n\\nWe generate a significant percentage of our Gross Bookings from trips in large metropolitan areas and trips to and from airports. If our operations in large metropolitan areas or ability to provide trips to and from airports are negatively affected, our financial results and future prospects would be adversely impacted.\\n\\nIn 2021, we derived 23% of our Mobility Gross Bookings from five metropolitan areas—Chicago, Miami, and New York City in the United States, Sao Paulo in Brazil, and London in the United Kingdom. We experience strong competition in large metropolitan areas, which has led us to offer significant Driver incentives and consumer discounts and promotions in these large metropolitan areas. As a result of our geographic concentration, our business and financial results are susceptible to economic, social, weather, and regulatory conditions or other circumstances in each of these large metropolitan areas. Outbreaks of contagious diseases or other viruses, such as COVID-19, could lead to a sustained decline in the desirability of living, working and congregating in metropolitan areas in which we operate. Any short-term or long-term shifts in the travel patterns of consumers away from metropolitan areas, due to health concerns regarding epidemics or pandemics such as COVID-19, could have an adverse impact on our Mobility Gross Bookings from these areas. An economic downturn, increased competition, or regulatory obstacles in any of these key metropolitan areas would adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results to a much greater degree than would the occurrence of such events in other areas. In addition, any changes to local laws or regulations within these key metropolitan areas that affect our ability to operate or increase our operating expenses in these markets would have an adverse effect on our business. Furthermore, if we are unable to renew existing licenses or do not receive new licenses in key metropolitan areas where we operate or such licenses are terminated, any inability to operate in such metropolitan area, as well as the publicity concerning any such termination or non-renewal, could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results.\\n\\nIn addition, in August 2018, New York City approved regulations for the local for-hire market (which includes our ridesharing products), including a cap on the number of new vehicle licenses issued to drivers who offer for-hire services. In December 2018, New York City implemented a per-mile and per-minute minimum trip payment formula, designed to establish a minimum pay standard, for drivers providing for-hire services in New York City, such as those provided by Drivers on our platform. These minimum rates took effect in February 2019. Since implementation, these regulations have had an adverse impact on our financial performance in New York City and may continue to do so in the future. Additionally, in November 2019, a ballot measure to impose a surcharge on ridesharing trips in San Francisco was approved by voters in San Francisco. This surcharge took effect on January 1, 2020. In addition, other jurisdictions such as Seattle have passed, or may consider or pass regulations that would implement minimum wage requirements or permit drivers to negotiate for minimum wages while providing services on our platform. Further, we expect that we will continue to face challenges in penetrating lower-density suburban and rural areas, where our network is smaller and less liquid, the cost of personal vehicle ownership is lower, and personal vehicle ownership is more convenient. If we are not successful in penetrating suburban and rural areas, or if we are unable to operate in certain key metropolitan areas in the future, our ability to serve what we consider to be our total addressable market would be limited, and our business, financial condition, and operating results would suffer.\\n\\nIn 2021, we generated 11% of our Mobility Gross Bookings from trips that either started or were completed at an airport. As a result of this concentration, our operating results are susceptible to existing regulations and regulatory changes that impact the ability of drivers using our platform to provide trips to and from airports. In addition, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, travel behavior has changed and airline travel has slowed, reducing the demand for Mobility to and from airports. Sustained declines in air travel due to COVID-19, or other travel-related health concerns, could continue to suppress demand for airport-related Mobility and reduce our Mobility Gross Bookings from airport trips. Certain airports currently regulate ridesharing within airport boundaries, including by mandating that ridesharing service providers obtain airport-specific licenses, and some airports, particularly those outside the United States, have banned ridesharing operations altogether. Despite such bans, some Drivers continue to provide Mobility services, including trips to and from airports, despite lacking the requisite permits. Such actions may result in the imposition of fines or sanctions, including further bans on our ability to operate within airport boundaries, against us or Drivers. Additional bans on our airport operations, or any permitting requirements or instances of non-compliance by Drivers, would significantly disrupt our operations. In addition, if drop-offs or pick-ups of riders become inconvenient because of airport rules or regulations, or more expensive because of airport-imposed fees, the number of Drivers or consumers could decrease, which would adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results. While we have entered into agreements with most major U.S. airports as well as certain airports outside the United States to allow the use of our platform within airport boundaries, we cannot guarantee that we will be able to renew such agreements on favorable terms if at all, and we may not be successful in negotiating similar agreements with airports in all jurisdictions.\\n\\nIf we fail to offer autonomous vehicle technologies on our platform or fail to offer such technologies on our platform before our competitors, or if such technologies fail to perform as expected, are inferior to those offered by our competitors, or are perceived as less safe than those offered by competitors or non-autonomous vehicles, our financial performance and prospects would be adversely impacted.\\n\\nWe have invested, and we may continue to invest, substantial amounts in companies with whom we partner to offer autonomous vehicle technologies on our platform. For example, in January 2021, we completed the merger of our autonomous technologies business with Aurora, and included a $400 million investment in the combined company and a commercial agreement pursuant to which we and Aurora will collaborate with respect to the launch and commercialization of self-driving vehicles on our ridesharing platform.\\n\\nSource\\n---\\n# Uber Quarterly Report\\n\\n# Uber Technologies, Inc. - Quarterly Report\\n\\nDate: 05/05/2024\\n\\nUber Technologies, Inc. discusses the impact of autonomous vehicle technologies on its business in the following ways:\\n\\n- Autonomous vehicles present substantial opportunities for Uber.\\n- Competitors like Waymo, Cruise Automation, Tesla, and others are developing autonomous vehicle technologies.\\n- Introduction of autonomous vehicles by competitors could impact Uber\\'s financial performance and prospects.\\n- Risks and liabilities associated with autonomous vehicle technologies include collisions and regulatory scrutiny.\\n- Government regulations on autonomous vehicle operation could affect Uber\\'s ability to offer such technologies.\\n\\nUber also highlights the importance of retaining high-quality personnel and the potential challenges related to attrition and management changes:\\n\\n- Challenges in attracting and retaining high-quality employees due to competition and workplace dynamics.\\n- Impact of COVID-19 on employee work arrangements and potential challenges in maintaining corporate culture.\\n- Leadership transitions and management changes may cause uncertainty and disrupt Uber\\'s business.\\n- Dependence on key personnel, including CEO Dara Khosrowshahi, and the need for effective succession planning.\\n- Use of equity incentives to attract and retain key personnel.\\n\\nFor more detailed information, you can access the full report here.\\n---\\n# Uber Quarterly Report\\n\\n# Uber Technologies, Inc. - Quarterly Report\\n\\nDate: 05/05/2024\\n\\n## Business Risks\\n\\n1. Impact of Economic Conditions:\\n\\nUber\\'s performance is subject to economic conditions affecting discretionary consumer spending. Factors such as general economic conditions, unemployment, consumer debt, and others can impact consumer behavior and preferences.\\n\\n2. Increases in Costs:\\n\\nInflation and other factors can lead to increased costs for drivers, carriers, and merchants on Uber\\'s platform. This may result in reduced services, higher prices for consumers, and decreased network liquidity.\\n\\n3. Security and Privacy Breaches:\\n\\nUber faces the risk of security breaches or unauthorized access to sensitive data, which could result in revenue loss, brand harm, and business disruption. Preventative measures and reliance on third-party service providers are crucial.\\n\\n4. Legal and Regulatory Risks:\\n\\nSecurity breaches may expose Uber to liability under various laws and regulations, leading to litigation and governmental investigations. Past incidents highlight the importance of robust security measures.\\n\\nFor more detailed information, you can access the full report here.\\n---\\n# Uber Quarterly Report\\n\\n# Uber Technologies, Inc. - Quarterly Report\\n\\nCode-sharing website used by software developers (the “2014 Breach”). In October and November of 2016, outside actors downloaded\\nthe personal data of approximately 57 million Drivers and consumers worldwide (the “2016 Breach”). The accessed data included the\\nnames, email addresses, mobile phone numbers, and drivers’ license numbers of approximately 600,000 Drivers, among other\\ninformation. For further information on this incident, see the risk factors titled “—We currently are subject to a number of inquiries,\\ninvestigations, and requests for information from the DOJ, state Attorney General (“AG”) offices, and other U.S. and foreign government\\nagencies, the adverse outcomes of which could harm our business” and “—We face risks related to our collection, use, transfer,\\ndisclosure, and other processing of data, which could result in investigations, inquiries, litigation, fines, legislative, and regulatory action,\\nand negative press about our privacy and data protection practices,” below. As we expand our operations, we may also assume liabilities\\nfor breaches experienced by the companies we acquire. For example, in April 2018, Careem publicly disclosed and notified relevant\\nregulatory authorities that it had been subject to a data security breach that allowed access to certain personal information of riders and\\ndrivers on its platform, as of January 14, 2018. If Careem becomes subject to liability as a result of this or other data security breaches, or\\nif we fail to remediate this or any other data security breach that Careem or we experience, we may face harm to our brand, business\\ndisruption, and significant liabilities.\\n\\nIf we are unable to successfully introduce new or upgraded products, offerings, or features for Drivers, consumers, merchants,\\nshippers, and carriers, we may fail to retain and attract such users to our platform and our operating results would be adversely\\naffected.\\n\\nTo continue to retain and attract Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, and carriers to our platform, we will need to continue to\\ninvest in the development of new products, offerings, and features that add value for Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, and\\ncarriers and that differentiate us from our competitors. For example, in January 2020, we introduced a number of product changes in\\nCalifornia intended to, among other things, provide Drivers with more information about rider destinations, trip distance, and expected\\nfares, display prices more clearly, and allow users to select preferred Drivers, all of which are intended to further strengthen the\\nindependence of Drivers in California and protect their ability to work flexibly when using the Uber platform.\\n\\nDeveloping and delivering these new or upgraded products, offerings, and features is costly, and the success of such new products,\\nofferings, and features depends on several factors, including the timely completion, introduction, and market acceptance of such products,\\nofferings, and features. Moreover, any such new or upgraded products, offerings, or features may not work as intended or may not\\nprovide intended value to platform users. For example, some product changes in California have resulted in, and may continue to result\\nin, reduced demand for rides and reduced supply of Drivers on our platform, Driver dissatisfaction, and adverse impacts on the operation\\nof our platform. If we are unable to continue to develop new or upgraded products, offerings, and features, or if platform users do not\\nperceive value in such new or upgraded products, offerings, and features, platform users may choose not to use our platform, which\\nwould adversely affect our operating results.\\n\\nWe track certain operational metrics and our category position with internal systems and tools, and our equity stakes in minority-owned\\naffiliates with information provided by such minority-owned affiliates, and do not independently verify such metrics.

The company emphasizes the importance of complying with payment card network operating rules and the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard to avoid fines, restrictions, or audits that could impact its ability to accept payment cards.\\n\\n## Cybersecurity Concerns\\n\\nUber acknowledges the increasing threat of cyberattacks, including malware, ransomware, and phishing attacks, which could compromise sensitive data, intellectual property, and business operations. The company recognizes the need for robust security measures and response plans to mitigate potential breaches and disruptions.\\n\\nSource: SEC Filing\\n---\\n# Uber Quarterly Report\\n\\n# Uber Technologies, Inc. - Quarterly Report\\n\\nThis document contains information from the quarterly report filed by Uber Technologies, Inc. with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\\n\\n## Cybersecurity Risks\\n\\nUber faces cybersecurity risks due to the nature of its platform and the volume of personal data. Despite efforts to protect data, there is no guarantee of absolute security.\\n\\n## Technical Infrastructure\\n\\nUber\\'s platform is complex, with interdependent components. Errors in software code or system disruptions could impact compliance, service availability, and user experience.\\n\\n## Climate Change Risks\\n\\nUber is exposed to climate change risks, including market shifts towards electric vehicles and extreme weather events. Compliance with emerging climate policies may impact operations and costs.\\n\\n## Climate Related Commitments\\n\\nUber has made commitments towards renewable energy and net zero emissions. However, external factors like regulations and unforeseen circumstances may require revisions to these commitments.\\n\\nSource: SEC Filing\\n---\\n# Uber Technologies, Inc. - Quarterly Report\\n\\n# Uber Technologies, Inc. - Quarterly Report\\n\\nDate: 05/05/2024, 16:31\\n\\nInterpretation, advances in technology such as battery storage, as well as the availability, cost, and accessibility of EVs to Drivers, and the availability of EV charging infrastructure that can be efficiently accessed by Drivers. Any failure to meet regulatory requirements related to climate change, or to meet our stated climate change commitments on the timeframe we committed to, or at all, could have an adverse impact on our costs and ability to operate, as well as harm our brand, reputation, and consequently, our business.\\n\\n## Dependencies on Third Parties\\n\\nThe successful operation of our business depends upon the performance and reliability of Internet, mobile, and other infrastructures that are not under our control.\\n\\nOur business depends on the performance and reliability of Internet, mobile, and other infrastructures that are not under our control. Disruptions in Internet infrastructure or GPS signals or the failure of telecommunications network operators to provide us with the bandwidth we need to provide our products and offerings have interfered, and could continue to interfere with the speed and availability of our platform. If our platform is unavailable when platform users attempt to access it, or if our platform does not load as quickly as platform users expect, platform users may not return to our platform as often in the future, or at all, and may use our competitors’ products or offerings more often. In addition, we have no control over the costs of the services provided by national telecommunications operators. If mobile Internet access fees or other charges to Internet users increase, consumer traffic may decrease, which may in turn cause our revenue to significantly decrease.\\n\\nOur business depends on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of mobile communications systems. The occurrence of an unanticipated problem, such as a power outage, telecommunications delay or failure, security breach, or computer virus could result in delays or interruptions to our products, offerings, and platform, as well as business interruptions for us and platform users. Furthermore, foreign governments may leverage their ability to shut down directed services, and local governments may shut down our platform at the routing level. Any of these events could damage our reputation, significantly disrupt our operations, and subject us to liability, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results. We have invested significant resources to develop new products to mitigate the impact of potential interruptions to mobile communications systems, which can be used by consumers in territories where mobile communications systems are less efficient. However, these products may ultimately be unsuccessful.\\n\\nWe rely on third parties maintaining open marketplaces to distribute our platform and to provide the software we use in certain of our products and offerings. If such third parties interfere with the distribution of our products or offerings or with our use of such software, our business would be adversely affected.\\n\\nOur platform relies on third parties maintaining open marketplaces, including the Apple App Store and Google Play, which make applications available for download. We cannot assure you that the marketplaces through which we distribute our platform will maintain their current structures or that such marketplaces will not charge us fees to list our applications for download. For example, Apple Inc. requires that iOS apps obtain users’ permission to track their activities across third-party apps and websites. If iOS users do not grant us such permission, our ability to target those users for advertisements and to measure the effectiveness of such advertisements may be adversely affected, which could decrease the effectiveness of our advertising, and increase our costs to acquire and engage users on our platform. We rely upon certain third parties to provide software for our products and offerings, including Google Maps for the mapping function that is critical to the functionality of our platform. We do not believe that an alternative mapping solution exists that can provide the global functionality that we require to offer our platform in all of the markets in which we operate. We do not control all mapping functions employed by our platform or Drivers using our platform, and it is possible that such mapping functions may not be reliable. If such third parties cease to provide access to the third-party software that we and Drivers use, do not provide access to such software on terms that we believe to be attractive or reasonable, or do not provide us with the most current version of such software, we may be required to seek comparable software from other sources, which may be more expensive or inferior, or may not be available at all, any of which would adversely affect our business.\\n\\nOur business depends upon the interoperability of our platform across devices, operating systems, and third-party applications that we do not control. One of the most important features of our platform is its broad interoperability with a range of devices, operating systems, and third-party applications. Our platform is accessible from the web and from devices running various operating systems such as iOS and Android. We depend on the accessibility of our platform across these third-party operating systems and applications that we do not control. Moreover, third-party services and products are constantly evolving, and we may not be able to modify our platform to assure its compatibility with that of other third parties following development changes. The loss of interoperability, whether due to actions of third parties or otherwise, could adversely affect our business.\\n\\nWe rely on third parties for elements of the payment processing infrastructure underlying our platform. If these third-party elements become unavailable or unavailable on favorable terms, our business could be adversely affected. The convenient payment mechanisms provided by our platform are key factors contributing to the development of our business. We rely on third parties for elements of our payment-processing infrastructure to remit payments to Drivers, merchants, and carriers using our platform, and these third parties may refuse to renew our agreements with them on commercially reasonable terms or at all. If these companies become unwilling or unable to provide these services to us on acceptable terms or at all, our business may be affected.\\n\\nSource\\n---\\n# Uber Quarterly Report\\n\\n# Uber Technologies, Inc. - Quarterly Report\\n\\nDisrupted. For certain payment methods, including credit and debit cards, we generally pay interchange fees and other processing and gateway fees, and such fees result in significant costs. In addition, online payment providers are under continued pressure to pay increased fees to banks to process funds, and there is no assurance that such online payment providers will not pass any increased costs on to merchant partners, including us. If these fees increase over time, our operating costs will increase, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results.\\n\\nIn addition, system failures have at times prevented us from making payments to Drivers in accordance with our typical timelines and processes, and have caused substantial Driver dissatisfaction and generated a significant number of Driver complaints. Future failures of the payment processing infrastructure underlying our platform could cause Drivers to lose trust in our payment operations and could cause them to instead use our competitors’ platforms. If the quality or convenience of our payment processing infrastructure declines as a result of these limitations or for any other reason, the attractiveness of our business to Drivers, merchants, and carriers could be adversely affected. If we are forced to migrate to other third-party payment service providers for any reason, the transition would require significant time and management resources, and may not be as effective, efficient, or well-received by platform users.\\n\\nWe currently rely on a small number of third-party service providers to host a significant portion of our platform, and any interruptions or delays in services from these third parties could impair the delivery of our products and offerings and harm our business.\\n\\nWe use a combination of third-party cloud computing services and co-located data centers in the United States and abroad. We do not control the physical operation of any of the co-located data centers we use or the operations of our third-party service providers. These third-party operations and co-located data centers may experience various risks such as break-ins, computer viruses, denial-of-service attacks, sabotage, acts of vandalism, and other misconduct. Our systems do not provide complete redundancy of data storage or processing, and as a result, any unexpected events may result in our inability to serve data reliably or require us to migrate our data to new facilities, which could be time-consuming and costly.\\n\\nOur use of third-party open source software could also pose risks such as possible litigation due to non-compliance with open source licenses and exposure to intellectual property claims. We may be required to publicly release certain portions of our proprietary source code or re-engineer our software if found to be non-compliant with open source licenses.\\n\\nOverall, these factors present challenges to our operations and may impact our ability to offer products and services effectively.\\n\\nSource: SEC Filing\\n---\\n# Uber Quarterly Report\\n\\n# Uber Technologies, Inc. - Quarterly Report\\n\\nDate and Time: 05/05/2024, 16:31\\n\\n## Financing and Transactional Risks\\n\\nUber Technologies, Inc. acknowledges the need for additional capital to support business growth.

The company operates in approximately 10,500 cities across 72 countries, each with varying laws and regulations. Compliance challenges and potential liabilities exist, especially in jurisdictions where laws are ambiguous or subject to change.\\n\\n### Regulatory Challenges\\n\\nIn some jurisdictions, Uber has faced legal challenges leading to fines, regulatory proceedings, and operational restrictions. For example, in Hong Kong and Colombia, court rulings impacted Uber\\'s services, leading to legal battles and operational changes. The company continues to assess and address regulatory concerns while advocating for policy changes to support its business model.\\n\\n### Compliance and Operational Impact\\n\\nNew and existing laws could significantly affect Uber\\'s operations and financial performance. Proposals that restrict business operations, increase costs, or limit user access pose risks to the company\\'s growth. Uber actively engages in legal challenges and lobbying efforts to oppose restrictive regulations and support its ridesharing services.\\n\\n### Environmental Regulations\\n\\nUber\\'s business model, heavily reliant on vehicles running on fossil fuels, faces challenges from regulations aimed at reducing air pollution and emissions. Initiatives like London\\'s clean-air fee and California\\'s EV targets impact Uber\\'s operations and necessitate strategic shifts towards electric vehicles. Compliance with evolving environmental regulations is crucial for Uber\\'s long-term sustainability.\\n\\n### International Considerations\\n\\nUber\\'s global presence exposes it to diverse regulatory landscapes and legal uncertainties.

We have operations in, and have business relationships with, entities in countries known to experience high levels of corruption. We are subject to the FCPA and other similar laws outside the United States that prohibit improper payments or offers of payments to foreign governments, their officials, and political parties for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. U.S. and non-U.S. regulators alike continue to focus on the enforcement of these laws, and we may be subject to additional compliance requirements to identify criminal activity and payments to sanctioned parties. Our activities in certain countries with high levels of corruption enhance the risk of unauthorized payments or offers of payments by Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers or carriers, employees, consultants, or business partners in violation of various anti-corruption laws, including the FCPA, even though the actions of these parties are often outside our control. Our acquisition of Careem may further enhance this risk because users of Careem’s platform and Careem’s employees, consultants, and business partners may not be familiar with, and may not have been previously subject to, these anti-corruption laws. In addition, our existing and future safeguards, including training and compliance programs to discourage these practices by such parties, may not prove effective, and such parties may engage in conduct for which we could be held responsible. Additional compliance requirements may compel us to revise or expand our compliance program, including the procedures we use to verify the identity of platform users and monitor international and domestic transactions.\\n\\nDrivers may become subject to increased licensing requirements, and we may be required to obtain additional licenses or cap the number of Drivers using our platform. Many Drivers currently are not required to obtain a commercial taxi or livery license in their respective jurisdictions. However, numerous jurisdictions in which we operate have conducted investigations or taken action to enforce existing licensing rules, including markets within Latin America and the Asia-Pacific region, and many others, including countries in Europe, the Middle East, and Africa, have adopted or proposed new laws or regulations that require Drivers to be licensed with local authorities or require us or our subsidiaries to be licensed as a transportation company. Local regulations requiring the licensing of us or Drivers may adversely affect our ability to scale our business and operations. In addition, it is possible that various jurisdictions could impose caps on the number of licensed Drivers or vehicles with whom we may partner or impose limitations on the maximum number of hours a Driver may work, similar to recent regulations that were adopted in Spain and New York City, which have temporarily frozen new vehicle licenses for Drivers using platforms like ours. If we or Drivers become subject to such caps, limitations, or licensing requirements, our business and growth prospects would be adversely impacted.\\n\\nWe may be subject to liability for the means we use to attract and onboard Drivers. We operate in an industry in which the competition for Drivers is intense. In this highly competitive environment, the means we use to onboard and attract Drivers may be challenged by competitors, government regulators, or individual plaintiffs. For example, putative class actions have been filed by individual plaintiffs against us for alleged violation of the Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991, alleging, among other things, that plaintiffs received text messages from us regarding our Driver program without their consent or after indicating to us they no longer wished to receive such text messages. In addition, in early 2017, we settled an investigation by the FTC into statements we made regarding potential Driver earnings and third-party vehicle leasing and financing programs. In connection with this matter, we agreed, among other things, to pay $20 million to the FTC for Driver redress. These lawsuits are expensive and time consuming to defend, and, if resolved adversely to us, could result in material financial damages and penalties, costly adjustments to our business practices, and negative publicity. In addition, we could incur substantial expense and possible loss of revenue if competitors file additional lawsuits or other claims challenging these practices.\\n\\nOur business depends heavily on insurance coverage for Drivers and on other types of insurance for additional risks related to our business. If insurance carriers change the terms of such insurance in a manner not favorable to Drivers or to us, if we are required to purchase additional insurance for other aspects of our business, or if we fail to comply with regulations governing insurance coverage, our business could be harmed. We use a combination of third-party insurance and self-insurance mechanisms, including a wholly owned captive insurance subsidiary. Insurance related to our Mobility products may include third-party automobile, automobile comprehensive and collision, physical damage, and uninsured and underinsured motorist coverage. We require Drivers to carry automobile insurance in most countries, and in many cases we also maintain insurance on behalf of Drivers. We rely on a limited number of ridesharing insurance providers, particularly internationally, and should such providers discontinue or increase the cost of coverage, we cannot guarantee that we would be able to secure replacement coverage on reasonable terms or at all. In addition to insurance related to our products, we maintain other automobile insurance coverage for owned vehicles and employee activity, as well as insurance coverage for non-automotive corporate risks including general liability, workers’ compensation, property, cyber liability, and director and officers’ liability. If our insurance carriers change the terms of our policies in a manner unfavorable to us or Drivers, our insurance costs could increase. The cost of insurance that we maintain on behalf of Drivers is higher in the United States and Canada than in other geographies. Further, if the insurance coverage we maintain is not adequate to cover losses that occur, we could be liable for significant additional costs. In addition, we and our captive insurance subsidiary are party to certain reinsurance and indemnification arrangements.\\n\\nSource: SEC Edgar Filing\\n---\\n# Uber Quarterly Report\\n\\n# Uber Technologies, Inc. - Quarterly Report\\n\\nDate: 05/05/2024, 16:31\\n\\nTransfer a significant portion of the risk from the insurance provider to us or our captive insurance subsidiary, which could require us to pay out material amounts that may be in excess of our insurance reserves, resulting in harm to our financial condition. Our insurance reserves account for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses for risks retained by us through our captive insurance subsidiary and other risk retention mechanisms. Such amounts are based on actuarial estimates, historical claim information, and industry data. While management believes that these reserve amounts are adequate, the ultimate liability could be in excess of our reserves. We also have requirements to post collateral for current and future claim settlement obligations with certain of our insurance carriers, which may have a significant impact on our unrestricted cash and cash equivalents available for general business purposes.\\n\\nWe may be subject to claims of significant liability based on traffic accidents, injuries, or other incidents that are claimed to have been caused by Drivers who use our platform, even when those Drivers are not actively using our platform or when an individual impersonates a Driver. As we expand to include more offerings on our platform, our insurance needs will likely extend to those additional offerings, including Freight. As a result, our automobile liability and general liability insurance policies and insurance maintained by Drivers may not cover all potential claims related to traffic accidents, injuries, or other incidents that are claimed to have been caused by Drivers who use our platform, and may not be adequate to indemnify us for all liability that we could face. Even if these claims do not result in liability, we could incur significant costs in investigating and defending against them. If insurers become insolvent, they may not be able to pay otherwise valid claims in a timely manner or at all. If we are subject to claims of liability relating to the acts of Drivers or others using our platform, we may be subject to negative publicity and incur additional expenses, which could harm our business, financial condition, and operating results.\\n\\nIn addition, we are subject to local laws, rules, and regulations relating to insurance coverage which could result in proceedings or actions against us by governmental entities or others. Legislation has been passed in many U.S. jurisdictions that codifies these insurance requirements with respect to ridesharing. Additional legislation has been proposed in other jurisdictions that seeks to codify or change insurance requirements with respect to ridesharing. Further, service providers and business customers of Freight and Uber for Business may require higher levels of coverage as a condition to entering into certain key contracts with us. Any failure, or perceived failure, by us to comply with local laws, rules, and regulations or contractual obligations relating to insurance coverage could result in proceedings or actions against us by governmental entities or others. These lawsuits, proceedings, or actions may subject us to significant penalties and negative publicity, require us to increase our insurance coverage, require us to amend our insurance policy disclosure, increase our costs, and disrupt our business.\\n\\nWe may be subject to pricing regulations, as well as related litigation or regulatory inquiries. Our revenue is dependent on the pricing models we use to calculate consumer fares and Driver earnings. Our pricing models, including dynamic pricing, have been, and will likely continue to be, challenged, banned, limited in emergencies, and capped in certain jurisdictions. For example, we have agreed to not calculate consumer fares in excess of the maximum government-mandated fares in all major Indian cities where legal proceedings have limited the use of surge pricing. Further, in 2018, Honolulu, Hawaii became the first U.S. city to pass legislation to cap surge pricing if increased rates exceed the maximum fare set by the city. Additional regulation of our pricing models could increase our operating costs and adversely affect our business. Furthermore, our pricing model has been the subject of litigation and regulatory inquiries related to, among other things, the calculation of and statements regarding consumer fares and Driver earnings (including rates, fees, surcharges, and tolls), as well as the use of surge pricing during emergencies and natural disasters. In addition, an increasing number of municipalities have proposed delivery network fee caps with respect to our Delivery offering and caps on surge pricing with respect to our Mobility offering. As a result, we may be forced to change our pricing models in certain jurisdictions, which could harm our revenue or result in a sub-optimal tax structure.\\n\\nIf we are unable to protect our intellectual property, or if third parties are successful in claiming that we are misappropriating the intellectual property of others, we may incur significant expense and our business may be adversely affected. Our intellectual property includes the content of our website, mobile applications, registered domain names, software code, firmware, hardware and hardware designs, registered and unregistered trademarks, trademark applications, copyrights, trade secrets, inventions (whether or not patentable), patents, and patent applications. We believe that our intellectual property is essential to our business and affords us a competitive advantage in the markets in which we operate. If we do not adequately protect our intellectual property, our brand and reputation may be harmed, Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, and carriers could devalue our products and offerings, and our ability to compete effectively may be impaired.\\n\\nTo protect our intellectual property, we rely on a combination of copyright, trademark, patent, and trade secret laws, contractual provisions, end-user policies, and disclosure restrictions. Upon discovery of potential infringement of our intellectual property, we assess and when necessary, take action to protect our rights as appropriate. We also enter into confidentiality agreements and invention assignment agreements with our employees and consultants and seek to control access to, and distribution of, our proprietary information in a commercially prudent manner. The efforts we have taken and may take to protect our intellectual property may not be sufficient or effective. For example, effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every country in which we currently or in the future will operate. In addition, it may be possible for other parties to copy or reverse-engineer our products and offerings or obtain and use the content of our website without authorization. Further, we may be unable to prevent competitors or other third parties from acquiring or using domain names or trademarks that are similar to, infringe upon, or diminish the value of our domain names, trademarks, service marks, and other proprietary rights.

Mobility Take Rate was 19.0%, down from 22.9% compared to the same period in 2020, primarily due to an increase in Mobility Driver incentives, as Mobility Driver additions have been outpaced by higher demand recovery in the U.S. and other markets.\\n\\nMobility adjusted EBITDA profit increased primarily attributable to an increase in Mobility revenue, partially offset by variable costs attributable to the overall growth of the business.\\n\\n## Delivery Segment\\n\\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the same period in 2020, Delivery revenue increased $4.5 billion, or 114% and Delivery adjusted EBITDA loss improved $525 million, or 60%.\\n\\nDelivery revenue increased primarily attributable to an increase in Delivery Gross Bookings of 66%, on a constant currency basis, driven by an increase in food delivery orders and higher basket sizes as a result of stay-at-home demand related to COVID-19, combined with continued expansion across U.S. and international markets. Take Rate improved to 16.2% from 12.9% compared to the same period in 2020 driven by a decrease in incentive spend combined with an overall improvement in basket sizes.\\n\\nDelivery adjusted EBITDA loss improved, primarily attributable to an increase in Delivery revenue, partially offset by a $2.6 billion increase in cost of revenue as well as a $710 million increase in consumer promotions, brand marketing, and employee headcount costs.\\n\\n## Freight Segment\\n\\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the same period in 2020, Freight revenue increased $1.1 billion, or 111% and Freight adjusted EBITDA loss improved $97 million, or 43%.\\n\\nFreight revenue increased primarily attributable to the acquisition of Transplace in the fourth quarter of 2021. Additionally, the increase in Freight revenue is also driven by the growth in the number of shippers and carriers on the network combined with an increase in volumes with our top shippers.\\n\\nFreight adjusted EBITDA loss improved, primarily attributable to a $135 million improvement in gross profit as a result of increased load margins, partially offset by an increase in employee headcount costs.\\n\\nSource\\n---\\n# Uber Quarterly Report\\n\\n# Uber Quarterly Report\\n\\nDate: 05/05/2024, 16:31\\n\\n## All Other Revenue and Adjusted EBITDA\\n\\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the same period in 2020, All Other revenue decreased $127 million, or 94%, and All Other adjusted EBITDA loss improved $450 million, or 98%.\\n\\nAll Other revenue and All Other adjusted EBITDA loss improved primarily due to the favorable impact of the sale of our ATG Business in the first quarter of 2021 and the JUMP Divestiture in the second quarter of 2020.\\n\\n## Certain Key Metrics and Non-GAAP Financial Measures\\n\\nAdjusted EBITDA and revenue growth rates in constant currency are non-GAAP financial measures.

Judgment is required to determine the appropriate classification of these incentives.\\n\\n### End-User Discounts and Promotions\\n\\nWe offer discounts and promotions to end-users to encourage the use of our platform. Judgment is required to determine the appropriate classification of these incentives.\\n\\n### Business Combinations\\n\\nWe allocate the fair value of purchase consideration to the tangible assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and intangible assets acquired based on their estimated fair values.\\n\\n### Embedded Derivatives\\n\\nDuring 2015, we had issued convertible notes that contain embedded features subject to derivative accounting. These embedded features are recognized as derivative liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet.\\n\\nFor more detailed information, refer to the full quarterly report.\\n---\\n# Uber Quarterly Report\\n\\n# Uber Technologies, Inc. - Quarterly Report\\n\\nDate: 05/05/2024\\n\\nTime: 16:31\\n\\nNotes with and without the QIPO Conversion Option are estimated utilizing a discounted cash flow model to discount the expected payoffs at various potential QIPO dates to the valuation date. The key inputs to the valuation model include the probability of a QIPO occurring at various points in time and the discount yield, which was derived by imputing the fair value as equal to the face value on the issuance date of these convertible notes. The discount rate is updated during each period to reflect the yield of a comparable instrument issued as of the valuation date.\\n\\nUpon closing of the IPO in May 2019, holders of these convertible notes elected to convert all outstanding notes into shares of common stock. For additional information, refer to Note 11 - Stockholders\\' Equity included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\\n\\n## Investments\\n\\nWe hold investments in privately held companies in the form of equity securities and debt securities without readily determinable fair values and in which we do not have a controlling interest or significant influence. Investments in equity securities without readily determinable fair values are initially recorded at cost and are subsequently adjusted to fair value for impairments and price changes from observable transactions in the same or a similar security from the same issuer. Investments in material available-for-sale debt securities are recorded initially at fair value and subsequently remeasured to fair value at each reporting date with the changes in fair value recognized in other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax. We may elect the fair value option for financial instruments and account for investments in debt and equity securities at fair value with changes reported in net income (loss) from continuing operations.\\n\\nInvestments in privately held equity and debt securities are valued using significant unobservable inputs or data in inactive markets. This valuation requires judgment due to the absence of market prices and inherent lack of liquidity and are classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. In determining the estimated fair value of our investments in privately held companies, we utilize the most recent data available including observed transactions such as equity financing transactions of the investees and sales of the existing shares of the investees’ securities. In addition, the determination of whether an observed transaction is similar to the equity and debt securities held by us requires significant management judgment based on the rights and preferences of the securities.\\n\\nWe assess our investment portfolio of privately held equity and debt securities quarterly for impairment. The impairment analysis for investments in equity securities includes a qualitative analysis of factors including the investee’s financial performance, industry and market conditions, and other relevant factors. If an equity investment is considered to be impaired we will establish a new carrying value for the investment and recognize an impairment loss through our consolidated statement of operations. Investments in debt securities are evaluated for impairment quarterly based on whether its fair value has declined below its amortized cost. In circumstances where we intend to sell, or are more likely than not required to sell the security before it recovers its amortized cost basis, the difference between the fair value and amortized cost is recognized as a loss in the consolidated financial statement of operations, with a corresponding write-down of the security’s amortized cost. In circumstances where neither condition exists, we then evaluate whether a decline is due to credit-related factors. The factors considered in determining whether a credit loss exists can include the extent to which fair value is less than the amortized cost basis, changes in the credit quality of the underlying loan obligors, credit ratings actions, as well as other factors.\\n\\n## Equity Method Investments\\n\\nWe account for investments in the common stock or in-substance common stock of entities that provide us with the ability to exercise significant influence, but not a controlling financial interest, using the equity method. Investments accounted for under the equity method are initially recorded at cost. Subsequently, we recognize through the consolidated statements of operations, and as an adjustment to the investment balance, our proportionate share of the investee entities’ net income or loss, and the amortization of basis differences. In accounting for these investments, we record our share of the entities’ net income or loss one quarter in arrears. Equity method investments for which the fair value option is elected are measured at fair value on a recurring basis with changes in fair value reflected in earnings.\\n\\nWe review our equity method investments for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the investment may not be fully recoverable. Qualitative and quantitative factors considered as indicators of a potential impairment include financial results and operating trends of the investees, implied values in transactions of the investee’s securities, severity and length of decline in value, and our intention for holding the investment, among other factors. If an impairment is determined to be other-than-temporary, the fair value of the impaired investment would have to be determined and an impairment charge recorded for the difference between the fair value and the carrying value of the investment. The fair value determination, particularly for investments in privately held companies, requires significant judgment to determine appropriate estimates.\\n---\\n# Uber Quarterly Report\\n\\n# Uber Technologies, Inc. - Quarterly Report\\n\\nDate: 05/05/2024\\n\\n## Goodwill Impairment Assessment\\n\\nUber reviews goodwill for impairment annually in the fourth quarter and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate potential impairment. The determination of reporting units and allocation of shared assets involve significant judgments and assumptions.\\n\\n## Loss Contingencies\\n\\nUber is involved in legal proceedings and claims, recording liabilities when a loss is probable and reasonably estimable. Adjustments are made based on developments in contingencies, requiring significant judgment.\\n\\n## Income Taxes\\n\\nUber accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method, making significant estimates for deferred tax assets and uncertain tax positions. The provision for income taxes includes reserve provisions and changes, subject to continuous examination by tax authorities.\\n\\nFor more detailed information, you can refer to the full SEC filing.\\n---\\n# Uber Quarterly Report\\n\\n# Insurance Reserves\\n\\nWe use a combination of third-party insurance and self-insurance mechanisms, including a wholly-owned captive insurance subsidiary, to provide for the potential liabilities for certain risks, including auto liability, uninsured and underinsured motorist, auto physical damage, general liability, and workers’ compensation. The insurance reserves is an estimate of our potential liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses, which represents the estimate of the ultimate unpaid obligation for risks retained by us and includes an amount for case reserves related to reported claims and an amount for losses incurred but not reported as of the balance sheet date. The estimate of the ultimate unpaid obligation utilizes generally accepted actuarial methods applied to historical claim and loss experience. In addition, we use assumptions based on actuarial judgment related to claim and loss development patterns and expected loss costs, which consider frequency trends, severity trends, and relevant industry data. These reserves are continually reviewed and adjusted as experience develops and new information becomes known. Adjustments, if any, relating to accidents that occurred in prior years are reflected in the current year results of operations.\\n\\nAll estimates of ultimate losses and allocated loss adjustment expenses, and of resulting reserves, are subject to inherent variability caused by the nature of the insurance claim settlement process. Such variability is increased for us due to limited historical experience and the nature of the coverage provided. Actual results depend upon the outcome of future contingent events and can be affected by many factors, such as claim settlement processes and changes in the economic, legal, and social environments. As a result, the net amounts that will ultimately be paid to settle the liability, and when these amounts will be paid, may vary in the near term from the estimated amounts.\\n\\nWhile management believes that the insurance reserve amount is adequate, the ultimate liability may be in excess of, or less than, the amount provided.\\n\\n# Stock-Based Compensation\\n\\nWe have granted stock-based awards consisting primarily of stock options, restricted common stock, RSUs, warrants, and SARs to employees, members of our board of directors and non-employees. The substantial majority of our stock-based awards have been made to employees. The majority of our outstanding RSUs, as well as certain options, SARs, and shares of restricted common stock, contain a service-based vesting condition. A small portion of the awards contains service-based vesting condition as well as performance-based vesting condition and/or market-based vesting condition. The service-based vesting condition for the majority of these awards is satisfied over four years. The performance-based vesting condition is satisfied upon meeting predetermined targets of certain financial and operation metrics. The market-based vesting condition is satisfied upon reaching predetermined targets of fully diluted equity values.\\n\\nWe account for stock-based employee compensation under the fair value recognition and measurement provisions, in accordance with applicable accounting standards, which requires compensation expense for the grant-date fair value of stock-based awards to be recognized over the requisite service period. We account for forfeitures when they occur.\\n\\nWe have elected to use the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to determine the fair value of stock options, warrants, and SARs on the grant date. The Black-Scholes option-pricing model requires certain subjective inputs and assumptions, including the fair value of our common stock, the expected term, risk-free interest rates, expected stock price volatility, and expected dividend yield of our common stock.\\n\\nThese assumptions used in the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, other than the fair value of our common stock, are estimated as follows:\\n\\n- Expected term. We estimate the expected term based on the simplified method for employees and on the contractual term for non-employees.\\n- Risk-free interest rate. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant.\\n- Expected volatility. We estimate the volatility of our common stock on the date of grant based on the weighted-average historical stock price volatility of our own common shares within the same length of period as the expected term. Where, in some cases, our common share trading history is shorter than the expected term, we consider comparable publicly-traded companies in our industry group.\\n- Expected dividend yield. Expected dividend yield is zero percent, as we have not paid and do not anticipate paying dividends on our common stock.\\n\\nWe continue to use judgment in evaluating the expected volatility and expected term utilized in our stock-based compensation expense calculation on a prospective basis. As we continue to accumulate additional data related to our common stock, we may refine our estimates of expected volatility and expected term, which could materially impact our future stock-based compensation expense.\\n\\n# Recent Accounting Pronouncements\\n\\nSee Note 1 – Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\\n---\\n# Uber Quarterly Report\\n\\n# Uber Technologies, Inc. - Quarterly Report\\n\\nDate: 05/05/2024, 16:31\\n\\n## ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\\n\\nWe are exposed to market risks in the ordinary course of our business. These risks primarily include interest rate risk, investment risk, and foreign currency risk as follows:\\n\\n### Interest Rate Risk\\n\\nOur exposures to market risk for changes in interest rates relate primarily to our 2025 Refinanced Term Loan and 2027 Refinanced Term Loan Facilities. The 2025 and 2027 Refinanced Term Loan Facilities represent floating rate notes and are carried at amortized cost. Therefore, fluctuations in interest rates will impact our consolidated financial statements. A rising interest rate environment will increase the amount of interest paid on these loans. A hypothetical 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would not have a material effect on our financial results.\\n\\nThe fair value of our fixed rate notes will generally fluctuate with movements of interest rates, increasing in periods of declining rates of interest and declining in periods of increasing rates of interest. A hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates would have decreased the fair value of our notes by $317 million as of December 31, 2021.\\n\\n### Investment Risk\\n\\nOur investment policy objective aims to preserve capital and meet liquidity requirements without significantly increasing risk. We had cash and cash equivalents including restricted cash and cash equivalents totaling $7.4 billion and $7.8 billion as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2021, respectively. We did not have any marketable debt securities classified as short-term investments as of December 31, 2021. Our cash and cash equivalents consist of money market funds and cash deposits. We do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes. Investments in fixed rate securities carry a degree of interest rate risk. Changes in rates would primarily impact interest income due to the relatively short-term nature of our investments. A hypothetical 100 basis point change in interest rates would not have a material effect on our financial results.\\n\\nWe are exposed to certain risk related to the carrying amounts of investments in other companies, including our minority-owned, privately-held affiliates and recently public companies, compared to their fair value. We hold privately held investments in illiquid private company stock which are inherently difficult to value given the lack of publicly available information. We also hold equity securities with readily determinable fair values which are subject to equity price risk. These investments in privately-held affiliates and recently public companies may increase the volatility in our net income/(loss) in future periods due to changes in the fair value of these investments. In certain cases, our ability to sell these investments may be impacted by contractual obligations to hold the securities for a set period of time after a public offering. As of December 31, 2021, the carrying value of our investments was $12.6 billion, including equity method investments.\\n\\n### Foreign Currency Risk\\n\\nWe transact business globally in multiple currencies. Our international revenue, as well as costs and expenses denominated in foreign currencies, expose us to the risk of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar. We are exposed to foreign currency risks related to our revenue and operating expenses denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Accordingly, changes in exchange rates may negatively affect our future revenue and other operating results as expressed in U.S. dollars. Our foreign currency risk is partially mitigated as our revenue recognized in currencies other than the U.S. dollar is diversified across geographic regions and we incur expenses in the same currencies in such regions.\\n\\nWe have experienced and will continue to experience fluctuations in our net income/(loss) as a result of transaction gains or (losses) related to remeasurement of our asset and liability balances that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the entities in which they are recorded. Foreign currency rates may also impact the value of our equity method investment in our Yandex.Taxi joint venture. At this time, we do not, but we may in the future, enter into derivatives or other financial instruments in an attempt to hedge our foreign currency exchange risk.\\n\\nSource: SEC Filing\\n---\\n# Uber Technologies, Inc. - Quarterly Report\\n\\n# Uber Technologies, Inc. - Quarterly Report\\n\\nFiling Date: 05/05/2024, 16:31\\n\\nLink to the full document: Uber Quarterly Report\\n\\n## ITEM 8.

Quarterly Report\\n\\nDate: 05/05/2024, 16:31\\n\\n## Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\\n\\n### Note 1 – Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\\n\\nDescription of Business: Uber Technologies, Inc. (“Uber”) is a technology platform based in San Francisco, California. Uber operates a network that connects consumers with ride services, delivery services, and public transportation networks.\\n\\nBasis of Presentation: The financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”). Wholly-owned and majority-owned subsidiaries are consolidated, along with variable interest entities where control is exercised.\\n\\nUse of Estimates: Management makes estimates and assumptions that impact reported amounts in the financial statements. These estimates cover various areas such as fair values of investments, useful lives of assets, and income taxes.\\n\\nConcentration of Credit Risk: Uber\\'s cash, investments, and receivables are potentially subject to credit risk concentration. The company limits credit exposure and has not experienced material losses in this regard.\\n\\nSignificant Risks and Uncertainties: Uber has incurred significant net losses and may need additional capital in the future to fund operations and strategic initiatives. Management believes current resources will be sufficient for the next twelve months.\\n\\nFor more detailed information, you can refer to the full SEC filing.\\n---\\n# Uber Quarterly Report\\n\\n# Uber Technologies, Inc. - Quarterly Report\\n\\nDate: 05/05/2024, 16:31\\n\\n## Management Discussion and Analysis\\n\\nIn March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of COVID-19 a pandemic, impacting market and economic conditions globally. The pandemic has affected Uber\\'s business operations, with changes in demand for Mobility and Delivery offerings. The ultimate impact of COVID-19 on Uber\\'s future operations and financial results remains uncertain.\\n\\n## Cash and Cash Equivalents\\n\\nCash and cash equivalents include highly-liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less. Cash also comprises amounts collected but not yet remitted to Drivers and Merchants, reflected in accrued and other current liabilities.\\n\\n## Restricted Cash and Cash Equivalents\\n\\nRestricted cash and cash equivalents are pledged for security or subject to legal/contractual restrictions. They are classified based on the term of the restriction. The reconciliation of cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash is provided in the table below:\\n\\n| |2019|2020|2021|\\n|---|---|---|---|\\n|Cash and cash equivalents|$10,873|$5,647|$4,295|\\n|Restricted cash - current|$99|$250|$631|\\n|Restricted cash - non-current|$1,095|$1,494|$2,879|\\n|Total cash and equivalents|$12,067|$7,391|$7,805|\\n\\n## Collateral Held by Insurer\\n\\nCollateral held by insurer represents funds held by James River Group companies and serves as collateral for claim settlement obligations. The reclassification of funds is detailed based on changes in insurance policies.\\n\\n## Legacy Auto Insurance Transfer\\n\\nUber\\'s captive insurance subsidiary entered into a Loss Portfolio Transfer Reinsurance Agreement with James River, impacting automobile liability insurance risks. The financial implications and liabilities associated with this transfer are discussed in the report.\\n\\nFor more detailed information, you can refer to the original SEC filing.\\n---\\n# Uber Quarterly Report\\n\\n# Uber Technologies, Inc. - Quarterly Report\\n\\nDate: 05/05/2024, 16:31\\n\\n## Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts\\n\\nAccounts receivable represents uncollected payments from end-users for completed transactions. We record an allowance for doubtful accounts for accounts receivable that may never settle or be collected. Chargebacks and credit card losses were $195 million, $178 million, and $246 million for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2020, and 2021, respectively.\\n\\n## Property and Equipment, Net\\n\\nProperty and equipment are stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. When assets are retired or disposed of, any resulting gain or loss is reflected in the consolidated statements of operations.\\n\\n### Estimated Useful Lives of Assets:\\n\\n|Asset|Estimated Useful Life|\\n|---|---|\\n|Land|Indefinite|\\n|Buildings|30-45 years|\\n|Site improvements|5-15 years|\\n|Leased vehicles|3-10 years|\\n|Computer equipment|3-5 years|\\n|Furniture and fixtures|3-5 years|\\n|Dockless e-bikes|3 years|\\n|Internal-use software|2 years|\\n|Leased computer equipment|Shorter of estimated useful life or lease term|\\n|Leasehold improvements|Shorter of estimated useful life or lease term|\\n\\nWe capitalize certain costs in developing internal-use software once planning is completed and it is probable that the project will be completed. Amortization of such costs occurs on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the asset.\\n\\n## Leased Vehicle Assets\\n\\nLeased vehicle assets are stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation. Maintenance and repair expenditures are charged to operating expenses as incurred.\\n\\nFor more information, you can refer to the full SEC filing.\\n---\\n# Uber Quarterly Report\\n\\n# Leases\\n\\nWe adopted Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 842, “Leases” (“ASC 842”) on January 1, 2019, using the modified retrospective transition method and used the effective date as the date of initial application. We elected the “package of practical expedients,” which permits us not to reassess under ASC 842 our prior conclusions about lease identification, lease classification and initial direct costs. We made a policy election not to separate non-lease components from lease components, therefore, we account for lease and non-lease components as a single lease component. We also elected the short-term lease recognition exemption for all leases that qualify.\\n\\nWe determine if a contract contains a lease at inception of the arrangement based on whether we have the right to obtain substantially all of the economic benefits from the use of an identified asset and whether we have the right to direct the use of an identified asset in exchange for consideration, which relates to an asset which we do not own. Right of use (“ROU”) assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. ROU assets are recognized as the lease liability, adjusted for lease incentives received. Lease liabilities are recognized at the present value of the future lease payments at the lease commencement date. The interest rate used to determine the present value of the future lease payments is our incremental borrowing rate (“IBR”), because the interest rate implicit in most of our leases is not readily determinable. The IBR is a hypothetical rate based on our understanding of what our credit rating would be to borrow and resulting interest we would pay to borrow an amount equal to the lease payments in a similar economic environment over the lease term on a collateralized basis. Lease payments may be fixed or variable; however, only fixed payments or in-substance fixed payments are included in our lease liability calculation. Variable lease payments may include costs such as common area maintenance, utilities, real estate taxes or other costs. Variable lease payments are recognized in operating expenses in the period in which the obligation for those payments are incurred.\\n\\nOperating leases are included in operating lease ROU assets, operating lease liabilities, current and operating lease liabilities, non-current on our consolidated balance sheets. Finance leases are included in property and equipment, net, accrued and other current liabilities, and other long-term liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. For operating leases, lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis in operations over the lease term. For finance leases, lease expense is recognized as depreciation and interest; depreciation on a straight-line basis over the lease term and interest using the effective interest method. As of December 31, 2020 and 2021, less than 12% of our operating lease ROU assets related to leased assets were outside of the U.S.\\n\\n# Acquisitions\\n\\nWe account for acquisitions of entities or asset groups that qualify as businesses in accordance with ASC 805, “Business Combinations” (“ASC 805”). The purchase price of the acquisition is allocated to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the acquisition date. The excess of the purchase price over those fair values is recorded as goodwill. During the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date, we may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the values of assets acquired or liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are recorded in the consolidated statements of operations. Refer to Note 18 – Business Combinations for further information.\\n\\n# Goodwill\\n\\nGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired in a business combination and is allocated to reporting units expected to benefit from the business combination. We test goodwill for impairment at least annually, in the fourth quarter, or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that goodwill might be impaired. We evaluate our reporting units when changes in our operating structure occur, and if necessary, reassign goodwill using a relative fair value allocation approach. In testing for goodwill impairment, we first assess\\n---\\n# Uber Quarterly Report\\n\\n# Uber Technologies, Inc. - Quarterly Report\\n\\nDate: 05/05/2024\\n\\n## Investments\\n\\n### Equity Securities\\n\\nAccounting for equity securities depends on marketability and type of investment:\\n\\n- Marketable equity securities in publicly traded companies are measured at fair value.\\n- Non-marketable equity securities are measured at cost, with remeasurements to fair value based on observable price changes or impairment.\\n\\n### Debt Securities\\n\\nAccounting for debt securities varies based on security type and intended holding period:\\n\\n- Debt securities are classified as available-for-sale and initially recorded at fair value.\\n- Changes in fair value of available-for-sale debt securities are recorded in other comprehensive income.\\n\\n### Allowance for Credit Losses on Available-for-sale Debt Securities\\n\\nCredit losses on available-for-sale debt securities are accounted for under ASC 326:\\n\\n- Evaluation of credit losses is done at the individual security level.\\n- Credit-related impairments are recognized as an allowance for credit loss on the balance sheet.\\n\\n### Equity Method Investments\\n\\nInvestments in entities with significant influence are accounted for under the equity method:\\n\\n- Recognize proportionate share of investees\\' net income or loss.\\n- Results of equity method investments are recorded one quarter in arrears.\\n\\nFor more detailed information, please refer to the original SEC filing.\\n---\\n# Uber Quarterly Report\\n\\n# Uber Technologies, Inc. - Quarterly Report\\n\\nDate: 05/05/2024\\n\\nTime: 16:31\\n\\n## Consolidated Statements of Operations\\n\\n...\\n\\n...\\n\\n## Evaluation of Long-Lived Assets for Impairment\\n\\n...\\n\\n...\\n\\n## Fair Value Measurements and Financial Instruments\\n\\n...\\n\\n...\\n\\n### Level 1\\n\\nObservable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\\n\\n### Level 2\\n\\nObservable inputs other than Level 1 prices such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets.\\n\\n### Level 3\\n\\nUnobservable inputs in which there is little or no market data and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities.\\n\\n...\\n\\n...\\n\\n## Variable Interest Entities\\n\\n...\\n\\n...\\n\\n## Revenue Recognition\\n\\n...\\n\\n...\\n\\nFor more detailed information, please refer to the full SEC filing.\\n---\\n# Uber Quarterly Report\\n\\n# Uber Quarterly Report\\n\\nDate: 05/05/2024, 16:31\\n\\n## Mobility and Delivery Agreements\\n\\nWe primarily enter into Master Services Agreements (“MSA”) with Drivers and Merchants to use the platform. The MSA defines the service fee we charge Drivers and Merchants for each transaction. Upon acceptance of a transaction, Drivers and Merchants agree to perform the services as requested by an end-user. The acceptance of a transaction request combined with the MSA establishes enforceable rights and obligations for each transaction. A contract exists between us and the Drivers and Merchants after the Drivers and Merchants accept a transaction request and the Drivers’ and Merchants’ ability to cancel the transaction lapses.\\n\\nThe Uber Service activities are performed to satisfy our sole performance obligation in the transaction, which is to connect Drivers and Merchants with end-users to facilitate the completion of a successful transaction.\\n\\nIn 2020, we began charging Mobility end-users a fee to use the platform in certain markets. In these transactions, in addition to a performance obligation to Drivers, we also have a performance obligation to end-users, which is to connect end-users to Drivers in the marketplace. We recognize revenue when a trip is complete. We present revenue on a net basis for these transactions, as we do not control the service provided by Drivers to end-users. For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2021, we recognized total revenue of $323 million and $336 million, respectively, associated with these fees charged to end-users.\\n\\nAdditionally, during the first quarter of 2020, we modified our arrangements in certain markets and as a result, concluded we are responsible for delivery services to end-users in those markets. We have determined that in these transactions, Merchants and end-users are our customers and revenue from these contracts shall be recognized separately for each under ASC 606. We recognize delivery service revenue associated with our performance obligation over the contract term, which represents its performance over the period of time the delivery is occurring. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we recognized revenue from end-users of $91 million and cost of revenue, exclusive of depreciation and amortization of $439 million associated with these delivery transactions. For the year ended December 31, 2021, we recognized revenue from end-users of $710 million and cost of revenue, exclusive of depreciation and amortization of $2.4 billion associated with these delivery transactions.\\n\\nIn all markets aside from the above two scenarios, end-users access the platform for free and we have no performance obligation to end-users. As a result, this class of end-users are not our customers.\\n\\n## Principal vs. Agent Considerations\\n\\nJudgment is required in determining whether we are the principal or agent in transactions with Drivers, Merchants and end-users. We evaluate the presentation of revenue on a gross or net basis based on whether we control the service provided to the end-user and are the principal (i.e. “gross”), or we arrange for other parties to provide the service to the end-user and are an agent (i.e. “net”). This determination also impacts the presentation of incentives provided to Drivers and Merchants and discounts and promotions offered to end-users to the extent they are not customers.\\n\\nFor the majority of Mobility and Delivery transactions, our role is to provide the Uber Service to Drivers and Merchants to facilitate a successful trip or Delivery service to end-users. We concluded we do not control the good or service provided by Drivers and Merchants to end-users as (i) we do not pre-purchase or otherwise obtain control of the Drivers’ and Merchants’ goods or services prior to its transfer to the end-user; (ii) we do not direct Drivers and Merchants to perform the service on our behalf, and (iii) we do not integrate services provided by Drivers and Merchants with our other services and then provide them to end-users. As part of our evaluation of control, we review other specific indicators to assist in the principal versus agent conclusions. We are not primarily responsible for Mobility and Delivery services provided to end-users, nor do we have inventory risk related to these services. While we facilitate setting the price for Mobility and Delivery services, the Drivers and Merchants and end-users have the ultimate discretion in accepting the transaction price and this indicator alone does not result in us controlling the services provided to end-users.\\n\\nIn the vast majority of transactions with end-users, we act as an agent of the Driver or Merchant by connecting end-users seeking Mobility and Delivery services with Drivers and Merchants looking to provide these services. Drivers and Merchants are our customers and pay us a service fee for each successfully completed transaction with end-users. Accordingly, we recognize revenue on a net basis, representing the fee we expect to receive in exchange for us providing the service to Drivers and Merchants. In certain markets, we promise Delivery services to end-users for a fee and separately subcontract with Couriers to provide delivery services. In these markets, we are the principal for the Delivery services and present Delivery revenue on a gross basis because we are primarily responsible for the services.\\n\\n## Mobility\\n\\nWe derive our Mobility revenue primarily from service fees paid by Drivers for use of the platform and related service to connect with Riders and successfully complete a trip via the Platform. We recognize revenue when a trip is complete.\\n\\nDepending on the market where the trip is completed, the service fee is either a fixed percentage of the end-user fare or the difference between the amount paid by an end-user and the amount earned by Drivers. In markets where we earn the difference between the amount paid by an end-user and the amount earned by Drivers, end-users are quoted a fixed upfront price for ridesharing services while we pay Drivers based on actual time and distance for the ridesharing services provided. Therefore, we can earn a variable amount and may realize a loss on the transaction. We typically receive the service fee within a short period of time following the completion of a trip.\\n\\nLink to full document\\n---\\n# Uber Quarterly Report\\n\\n# Uber Technologies, Inc. - Quarterly Report\\n\\nDate: 05/05/2024, 16:31\\n\\n## Revenue Streams\\n\\nUber Technologies, Inc. generates revenue from various streams including Mobility, Delivery, Freight, Brokerage, and Transportation Management.\\n\\n### Mobility Revenue\\n\\nRevenue from mobility services includes payments made by end-users for trips. Cash payments are collected by drivers, and service fees are offset against amounts due to drivers.\\n\\n### Delivery Revenue\\n\\nDelivery revenue comes from service fees paid by couriers and merchants for using the platform. Revenue is recognized upon completion of a delivery transaction.\\n\\n### Freight Revenue\\n\\nFreight revenue is derived from transportation services provided to shippers. The acquisition of Transplace has expanded the freight revenue stream.\\n\\n### Brokerage Revenue\\n\\nBrokerage revenue represents fees charged to shippers for services provided. Costs with carriers are recorded in the cost of revenue.\\n\\n### Transportation Management Revenue\\n\\nRevenue from transportation management services is recognized on a gross basis for services controlled by Uber. Costs with carriers are recorded in the cost of revenue.\\n\\n## Principal vs. Agent Considerations\\n\\nUber determines whether it acts as a principal or agent in transactions with shippers based on control over services provided and pricing discretion.\\n\\nFor more detailed information, you can refer to the full SEC filing.\\n---\\n# Uber Quarterly Report\\n\\n# Uber Quarterly Report\\n\\nDate: 05/05/2024, 16:31\\n\\n## All Other Revenue\\n\\nE-Bikes and E-Scooters\\n\\nPrior to the second quarter of 2020, All Other revenue (formerly our Other Bets segment) consisted primarily of revenue from New Mobility products, which were derived from operating leases as defined within ASC 842. New Mobility refers to offerings and products that provided users access to rides through a variety of modes, including dockless e-bikes and e-scooters (“New Mobility”). Users contracted with us via a rental agreement at the inception of each trip. We were responsible for providing access to the e-bikes and e-scooters over the user’s desired period of use. We recorded lease payments received upon completion of each trip. After the JUMP Divestiture during the second quarter of 2020, revenue from New Mobility products, including dockless e-bikes, was no longer material. Refer to Note 19 – Divestitures for further information on the JUMP Divestiture.\\n\\n## Advanced Technologies Group (“ATG”) and Other Technology Programs Collaboration Revenue\\n\\nIn 2019, we entered into a three-year joint collaboration agreement with certain third parties to develop next–generation self-driving technology. Under this collaboration agreement, we received cash consideration over the three-year term. We have applied ASC 808, Collaborative Arrangements for recognition and presentation of the consideration received as collaboration revenue. Refer to Note 17 – Non-Controlling Interests for further information.\\n\\n## Incentives to Customers\\n\\nIncentives provided to customers are recorded as a reduction of revenue if we do not receive a distinct good or service or cannot reasonably estimate the fair value of the good or service received. Incentives to customers that are not provided in exchange for a distinct good or service are evaluated as variable consideration, in the most likely amount to be earned by the customer at the time or as they are earned by customers, depending on the type of incentive. Since incentives are earned over a short period of time, there is limited uncertainty when estimating variable consideration.\\n\\n## Advertising Revenue\\n\\nWe derive the majority of our advertising revenue from sponsored listing fees paid by merchants and brands in exchange for advertising on our platform. Advertising revenue is recognized when an end-user engages with the sponsored listing based on the number of clicks. Revenue is presented on a gross basis in the amount billed to merchants as we control the advertisement before it is transferred to the end-user.\\n\\n## End-User Discounts and Promotions\\n\\nWe offer discounts and promotions to end-users (that are not our customers) to encourage use of our platform. These are offered in various forms of discounts and promotions including targeted end-user discounts and promotions, end-user referrals, and market-wide promotions. The costs of these discounts and promotions are recorded as sales and marketing expenses at the time they are redeemed by the end-user.\\n\\nLink to full document\\n---\\n# Uber Quarterly Report\\n\\n# Uber Quarterly Report\\n\\nDate: 05/05/2024, 16:31\\n\\n## Refunds\\n\\nWe record refunds to end-users that we recover from Drivers and Merchants as a reduction of revenue. Refunds to end-users due to end-user dissatisfaction with the Platform are recorded as marketing expenses and reduce the accounts receivable amount associated with the corresponding transaction.\\n\\n## Other\\n\\nWe have elected to exclude from revenue, taxes assessed by a governmental authority that are both imposed on and are concurrent with specific revenue producing transactions, and collected from Drivers, Merchants and end-users and remitted to governmental authorities. Accordingly, such amounts are not included as a component of revenue or cost of revenue.\\n\\n## Practical Expedients\\n\\nWe have utilized the practical expedient available under ASC 606-10-50-14 and do not disclose the value of unsatisfied performance obligations for contracts with an original expected length of one year or less. We have no significant financing components in our contracts with customers.\\n\\n## Stock-Based Compensation\\n\\nWe account for stock-based compensation expense in accordance with the fair value recognition and measurement provisions of GAAP, which requires compensation cost for the grant-date fair value of stock-based awards to be recognized over the requisite service period. We account for forfeitures when they occur. The fair value of stock-based awards, granted or modified, is determined on the grant date (or modification or acquisition dates, if applicable) at fair value, using appropriate valuation techniques.\\n\\n## Service-Based Awards\\n\\nWe record stock-based compensation expense for service-based stock options and restricted stock units (“RSU(s)”) on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, which is generally four years.\\n\\n## Performance-Based Awards\\n\\nWe have granted restricted common stock awards (“RSA(s)”), RSUs, stock appreciation rights (“SAR(s)”), stock options, and warrants that vest upon the satisfaction of both service-based and performance-based conditions. The service-based condition for these awards generally is satisfied over four years. The performance-based conditions generally are satisfied upon achieving specified performance targets, such as our financial or operating metrics, and/or the occurrence of a qualifying event, defined as the earlier of (i) the closing of certain specific liquidation or change in control transactions, or (ii) an initial public offering (“IPO”). We record stock-based compensation expense for performance-based equity awards such as RSAs, RSUs, SARs, and stock options on an accelerated attribution method over the requisite service period, which is generally four years, and only if performance-based conditions are considered probable to be satisfied.\\n\\nFor more information, you can refer to the full document here.\\n---\\n# Uber Quarterly Report\\n\\n# Uber Technologies, Inc. - Quarterly Report\\n\\nDate: 05/05/2024, 16:31\\n\\n## Market-Based Awards\\n\\nWe have granted RSUs and stock options that vest only upon the satisfaction of all the following conditions: service-based service conditions, performance-based conditions, and/or market-based conditions. The service-based condition for these awards generally is satisfied over four years. The performance-based conditions generally are satisfied upon achieving specified performance targets, such as the occurrence of a qualifying event, as described above for performance-based awards. The market-based conditions are satisfied upon our achievement of specified fully-diluted equity values, as determined based on our stock price.\\n\\n## Valuation of Stock-Based Awards\\n\\nFor market-based awards, we determine the grant-date fair value utilizing a Monte Carlo valuation model, which incorporates various assumptions including expected stock price volatility, expected term, risk-free interest rates, expected date of a qualifying event, and expected capital raise percentage. We estimate the volatility of common stock on the date of grant based on the weighted-average historical stock price volatility of comparable publicly-traded companies in its industry group. We estimate the expected term based on various exercise scenarios. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant.\\n\\n## Employee Stock Purchase Plan (“ESPP”)\\n\\nWe recognize stock-based expenses related to shares issued pursuant to our 2019 ESPP on a straight-line basis over the offering period. The ESPP provides for twelve-month offering periods, and each offering period includes two purchase periods of approximately six months. The ESPP allows eligible employees to purchase shares of our common stock at a 15 percent discount on the lower price of either (i) the offering period begin date or (ii) the purchase date.\\n\\n## Common Stock Fair Value\\n\\nSubsequent to our IPO in May 2019, the fair value of common stock was determined on the grant date using the closing price of our common stock. Prior to our IPO, the fair value of our common stock for granting stock-based awards was determined by the Board of Directors with the assistance of contemporaneous third-party valuations.\\n\\n## Income Taxes\\n\\nWe account for income taxes using the asset and liability method, recognizing deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events recognized in our financial statements. We also account for uncertainty in tax positions and recognize accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in the provision for income taxes.\\n\\nLink to full report\\n---\\n# Uber Quarterly Report\\n\\n# Uber Technologies, Inc. - Quarterly Report\\n\\nDate: 05/05/2024, 16:31\\n\\n## Management Discussion and Analysis\\n\\nIn the quarterly report filed by Uber Technologies, Inc., management discusses various aspects of the company\\'s financial performance and operations. This includes assessments related to tax laws, deferred tax assets, expenses breakdown, and restructuring charges.\\n\\n## Assessment of Net Operating Losses\\n\\nUber Technologies, Inc. elected the tax law ordering approach in assessing the realizability of net operating losses to offset future Global Intangible Low-taxed Income (\"GILTI\"). GILTI inclusions are treated as a period cost.\\n\\n## Deferred Tax Assets and Intangible Assets\\n\\nManagement makes significant estimates and assumptions to establish deferred tax assets from intra-entity transfers of intangible assets. These estimates involve determining the fair value of intangible assets based on various factors such as revenue forecasts, asset life, transaction values, and discount rates.\\n\\n## Expenses Breakdown\\n\\nThe report provides a breakdown of expenses including:\\n\\n- Cost of revenue\\n- Operations and support expenses\\n- Sales and marketing expenses\\n- Research and development expenses\\n- General and administrative expenses\\n- Depreciation and amortization expenses\\n\\n## Restructuring and Related Charges\\n\\nCosts associated with restructuring activities such as headcount reductions and facility consolidations are recognized when incurred. This may include termination benefits, asset impairments, and contract termination costs.\\n\\nFor more detailed information, you can refer to the full SEC filing.\\n---\\n# Uber Quarterly Report\\n\\n# Uber Technologies, Inc. - Quarterly Report\\n\\nDate: 05/05/2024\\n\\nTime: 16:31\\n\\nRestructuring and related charges are recognized as an operating expense within the consolidated statements of operations and are classified based on our classification policy for each category of operating expense. Personnel costs are classified based on each employee’s classification, lease costs (including impairments of right-of-use assets) are classified in the same expense line item where each lease’s rent expense was recognized and impairment of other long-lived assets are recorded within general and administrative expenses.\\n\\nForeign Currency\\n\\nThe functional currency of our foreign subsidiaries is the local currency or U.S. dollar depending on the nature of the subsidiaries’ activities. Monetary assets and liabilities, and transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are remeasured to the functional currency at the exchange rate in effect at the end of the period and are recorded in the current period consolidated statement of operations. Gains and losses resulting from remeasurement are recorded in foreign exchange gains (losses), net within other income (expense), net in the consolidated statements of operations. Subsidiary assets and liabilities with non-U.S. dollar functional currencies are translated at the month-end rate, retained earnings and other equity items are translated at historical rates, and revenues and expenses are translated at average exchange rates during the year. Cumulative translation adjustments are recorded within accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), a separate component of total equity (deficit).\\n\\nNet Income (Loss) Per Share Attributable to Common Stockholders\\n\\nWe compute net income (loss) per share using the two-class method required for participating securities. The two-class method requires income available to common stockholders for the period to be allocated between common stock and participating securities based upon their respective rights to receive dividends as if all income for the period had been distributed.\\n\\nOur restricted common stock, and common stock issued upon early exercise of stock options are participating securities. We consider restricted common stock and any shares issued upon early exercise of stock options, subject to repurchase, to be participating securities because holders of such shares have non-forfeitable dividend rights in the event a cash dividend is declared on common stock.\\n\\nPrior to conversion to common stock upon our IPO, the holders of the redeemable convertible preferred stock would have been entitled to dividends in preference to common shareholders, at specified rates, if declared. Then any remaining earnings would be distributed to the holders of common stock, restricted common stock, common stock issued upon early exercise of stock options, and the holders of the redeemable convertible preferred stock on a pro-rata basis assuming conversion of all redeemable convertible preferred stock into common stock. These participating securities did not contractually require the holders of such shares to participate in our losses.\\n\\nInsurance Reserves\\n\\nWe use a combination of third-party insurance and self-insurance mechanisms, including a wholly-owned captive insurance subsidiary, to provide for the potential liabilities for certain risks, including auto liability, uninsured and underinsured motorist, auto physical damage, general liability, and workers’ compensation. The insurance reserves is the liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses, which represents the estimate of the ultimate unpaid obligation for risks retained by us and includes an amount for case reserves related to reported claims and an amount for losses incurred but not reported as of the balance sheet date. The estimate of the ultimate unpaid obligation utilizes generally accepted actuarial methods applied to historical claim and loss experience. In addition, we use assumptions based on actuarial judgment related to claim and loss development patterns and expected loss costs, which consider frequency trends, severity trends, and relevant industry data. These reserves are continually reviewed and adjusted as experience develops and new information becomes known. Adjustments, if any, relating to accidents that occurred in prior years are reflected in the current year results of operations. Reserve amounts estimated to be settled within one year are recorded in short-term insurance reserves, with longer term settlements recorded in long-term insurance reserves on the consolidated balance sheets.\\n\\nWhile management believes that the insurance reserve amount is adequate, the ultimate liability may be in excess of, or less than, the amount provided. All estimates of ultimate losses and allocated loss adjustment expenses, and of resulting reserves, are subject to inherent variability caused by the nature of the insurance claim settlement process. Such variability is increased for us due to limited historical experience and the nature of the coverage provided. Actual results depend upon the outcome of future contingent events and can be affected by many factors, such as claims settlement processes and changes in the economic, legal, and social environments. As a result, the net amounts that will ultimately be paid to settle the liability and when these amounts will be paid may vary from the estimate provided on the consolidated balance sheets.\\n\\nLoss Contingencies\\n\\nWe are involved in legal proceedings, claims, and regulatory, indirect tax examinations or government inquiries and investigations that may arise in the ordinary course of business. Certain of these matters include speculative claims for substantial or indeterminate amounts of damages. We record a liability when we believe that it is both probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. If we determine that a loss is reasonably possible and the loss or range of loss can be reasonably estimated, we disclose the possible loss in the consolidated financial statements.\\n\\nSource\\n---\\n# Uber Quarterly Report\\n\\n# Uber Quarterly Report\\n\\nDate: 05/05/2024, 16:31\\n\\n## Developments in Contingencies\\n\\nWe review the developments in our contingencies that could affect the amount of provisions previously recorded. Adjustments are made to provisions and disclosures based on negotiations, settlements, legal advice, and updated information. Significant judgment is required to determine probability and estimated loss.\\n\\n## Outcomes of Litigation and Investigations\\n\\nThe outcomes of litigation, tax examinations, and investigations are uncertain. Adverse resolutions could materially affect our results, financial condition, and cash flows.\\n\\n## Recognition of Estimated Losses\\n\\nEstimated losses related to proceedings involving Drivers are recognized as a reduction of revenue. Other estimated losses are recognized in general and administrative expenses. Legal fees and costs are expensed as incurred.\\n\\n## Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements\\n\\nIn January 2020, we adopted ASU 2020-01 clarifying accounting for equity investments, equity method investments, and derivatives. The adoption had no material impact on our financial statements.\\n\\nIn August 2020, we early adopted ASU 2020-06 on convertible instruments and contracts in entity\\'s own equity. Refer to specific notes for impacts on long-term debt and earnings per share.\\n\\n## Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\\n\\nASU 2021-08 on accounting for contract assets and liabilities in business combinations is being evaluated for its impact.

Given the number of years remaining subject to examination and the number of matters being examined, we are unable to estimate the full range of possible adjustments to the balance of gross unrecognized tax benefits.

As of December 31, 2020 and 2021, the amounts of non-controlling interests represented by subsidiaries’ preferred units and preferred stock were $1.3 billion and $1.0 billion, respectively.\\n\\n### ATG Investment: Preferred Unit Purchase Agreement\\n\\nIn July 2019, we closed a Preferred Unit Purchase Agreement with SoftBank, Toyota, and DENSO (collectively “the Investors”) for purchase by the Investors of Class A Preferred Units (“Preferred Units”) in Apparate. Apparate, a subsidiary of ours, issued 1.0 million Preferred Units at $1,000 per unit to the Investors for an aggregate consideration of $1.0 billion ($400 million from Toyota, $333 million from SoftBank, and $267 million from DENSO). As of December 31, 2020, the Preferred Units represented an aggregate 14.2% ownership interest in Apparate on an as-converted basis. As of December 31, 2020, we retained the remaining 85.8% ownership interest. SoftBank and Toyota are our existing investors.\\n\\nAt the option of the Investors, the Preferred Units are convertible into common units of Apparate, initially on a one-for-one basis but subject to potential adjustment, as defined by the Preferred Unit Purchase Agreement at any time. The Preferred Units are entitled to certain distributions, including primarily dividends which are payable in cash or in-kind (at Apparate\\'s discretion), and accrue quarterly, compounded on the last day of each quarter at a 4.5% annual rate. The Preferred Units are entitled to distributions upon the occurrence of a sale or liquidation of Apparate representing an amount that is equal to the greater of (i) the original investment plus any accrued but unpaid amounts, and (ii) their share of distributions assuming conversion to common units of Apparate immediately prior to the sale or liquidation event. The quarterly dividend, along with any attributed prorated share of Apparate’s net income (if applicable), are included in net income (loss) attributable to non-controlling interests, net of tax in our consolidated statements of operations. The Preferred Units do not participate in net losses due to a liquidation preference.\\n\\n### SoftBank’s Preferred Units\\n\\nBeginning on July 2, 2026, SoftBank has the option to put to us all, but not less than all, of its initial investment in Preferred Units at a price equal to the number of SoftBank’s Preferred Units multiplied by the greater of (i) the original investment plus any accrued but unpaid amounts per unit and (ii) the fair value of the Preferred Units at the time of conversion (the “Put/Call Price”). Beginning on July 2, 2026, we can call all, but not less than all, of the Preferred Units held by SoftBank at the Put/Call Price. We have the option to settle all, or a portion of, the Put/Call Price with its common stock and any remainder will be satisfied in cash. The put and call were determined to be embedded features within the SoftBank Preferred Units since they are not separately exercisable or legally detached from the SoftBank Preferred Units.\\n\\nAs of December 31, 2020, the SoftBank Preferred Units were classified as redeemable non-controlling interests in our consolidated financial statements and reported at the Put/Call Price which was determined as of the balance sheet date. The initial fair value of SoftBank’s Preferred Units was determined based on a hybrid method with the option pricing model as the primary methodology. This method used Level 3 fair value measurement inputs as well as an assumed equal probability of the occurrence of a liquidation or exit event. The significant unobservable inputs used in the initial fair value measurement include: volatility of 42%, time to liquidity of 5 years, and a discount for lack of marketability of 17%. A market approach was also used to corroborate the valuation derived from the hybrid method at issuance to evidence that the issuance price of the Preferred Units approximated their fair value. There was no fair value adjustment to SoftBank’s redeemable non-controlling interests during the year ended December 31, 2020.\\n\\n### Toyota and DENSO’s Preferred Units\\n\\nAs of December 31, 2020, the Toyota and DENSO Preferred Units were classified as non-redeemable non-controlling interests as these units were not subject to any mandatory redemption rights or redemption rights that are outside our control.\\n\\n### ATG Collaboration Agreement with Apparate, Toyota and DENSO\\n\\nIn conjunction with the Preferred Unit Purchase Agreement discussed above, we entered into a three-year joint collaboration agreement among Toyota, DENSO, and Apparate to develop next-generation self-driving technology (the “ATG Collaboration Agreement”), which became effective as of the closing of the Preferred Unit Purchase Agreement in July 2019. Pursuant to the ATG Collaboration Agreement, Toyota would make cash payments to Apparate up to an aggregate of $300 million, payable in six semi-annual installments during the three-year term of the ATG Collaboration Agreement. The cash payments for each six-month period were contingent upon the mutual agreement between the parties on the development activities and milestones to be achieved in the next six months and the continuation of the ATG Collaboration Agreement. The ATG Collaboration Agreement was within the scope of ASC 808, Collaborative Arrangements. The development activities were considered ongoing and central to the activities of ATG. As a result, the amounts received from Toyota were recognized as collaboration revenue in the All other segment (formerly ATG and Other Technology Programs) ratably over the respective six-month service period to which each payment relates, as the related development activities are performed. During the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2020, we recognized $42 million and $100 million, respectively, as revenue under the ATG Collaboration Agreement.\\n\\n#### Divestiture of ATG Business to Aurora\\n\\nSource: SEC Filing\\n---\\n# Uber Quarterly Report\\n\\n# Uber Quarterly Report\\n\\nDate: 05/05/2024, 16:31\\n\\nFiled with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)\\n\\n## Divestitures\\n\\nOn January 19, 2021, Uber completed the sale of its ATG Business to Aurora.
