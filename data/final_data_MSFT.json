[{"text": " table of contents  \u00a0 part i  item 1a  \u00a0 business model competition  companies compete with us based on a growing variety of business models.  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 the competitive pressures described above may cause decreased sales volumes, price reductions, and/or increased operating costs, such as for research and development, marketing, and sales incentives. this may lead to lower revenue, gross margins, and operating income.  our increasing focus on services presents execution and competitive risks.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0a growing part of our business involves cloud-based services available across the spectrum of computing devices. our strategic vision is to compete and grow as a productivity and platform company for the mobile-first and cloud-first world. at the same time, our competitors are rapidly developing and deploying cloud-based services for consumers and business customers. pricing and delivery models are evolving. devices and form factors influence how users access services in the cloud and sometimes the user\u0092s choice of which suite of cloud-based services to use. we are devoting significant resources to develop and deploy our cloud-based strategies. the windows ecosystem must continue to evolve with this changing environment. we are undertaking cultural and organizational changes to drive accountability and eliminate obstacles to innovation. the company\u0092s increasing reliance on data-driven insights is becoming more important to the success of key opportunities in monetization, customer perceptions of quality, and operational efficiency. besides software development costs, we are incurring costs to build and maintain infrastructure to support cloud computing services. these costs will reduce the operating margins we have previously achieved. whether we succeed in cloud-based services depends on our execution in several areas, including:  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 it is uncertain whether our strategies will attract the users or generate the revenue required to succeed. if we are not effective in executing organizational and technical changes to increase efficiency and accelerate innovation, or if we fail to generate sufficient usage of our new products and services, we may not grow revenue in line with the infrastructure and development investments described above. this may negatively impact gross margins and operating income.  \u00a0 19  table of contents  \u00a0 part i  item 1a  \u00a0 we make significant investments in new products and services that may not achieve expected returns.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0we will continue to make significant investments in research, development, and marketing for existing products, services, and technologies, including the windows operating system, the microsoft office system, bing, windows phone, windows server, the windows store, the microsoft azure services platform, office 365, other cloud-based services offerings, and the xbox entertainment platform. we also invest in the development and acquisition of a variety of hardware for productivity, communication, and entertainment including pcs, tablets, phones, and gaming devices. investments in new technology are speculative. commercial success depends on many factors, including innovativeness, developer support, and effective distribution and marketing. if customers do not perceive our latest offerings as providing significant new functionality or other value, they may reduce their purchases of new software and hardware products or upgrades, unfavorably affecting revenue. we may not achieve significant revenue from new product, service, and distribution channel investments for several years, if at all. new products and services may not be profitable, and even if they are profitable, operating margins for some new products and businesses will not be as high as the margins we have experienced historically.  the launch of windows 10, with free upgrades available to existing users of windows 7 and 8.1, constitutes the most ambitious update effort we have ever undertaken. we have done extensive preparation and compatibility testing for applications and devices to help ensure a positive experience for our users installing windows 10. however, if users have a negative upgrade experience, or the community reacts negatively to the process we are following to promote and undertake the upgrades, the reception of windows\u00a010 in the marketplace may be harmed.\u00a0in addition, we anticipate that windows\u00a010 will enable new post-license monetization opportunities beyond initial license revenues.\u00a0our failure to realize these opportunities to the extent we expect could have an adverse impact on our revenues.  developing new technologies is complex. it can require long development and testing periods. significant delays in new releases or significant problems in creating new products or services could adversely affect our revenue.  acquisitions, joint ventures, and strategic alliances may have an adverse effect on our business.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0we expect to continue making acquisitions and entering into joint ventures and strategic alliances as part of our long-term business strategy. these transactions and arrangements involve significant challenges and risks including that they do not advance our business strategy, that we get an unsatisfactory return on our investment, that we have difficulty integrating new employees, business systems, and technology, or that they distract management from our other businesses. if an arrangement fails to adequately anticipate changing circumstances and interests of a party, it may result in early termination or renegotiation of the arrangement. the success of these transactions and arrangements will depend in part on our ability to leverage them to enhance our existing products and services or develop compelling new ones. it may take longer than expected to realize the full benefits from these transactions and arrangements, such as increased revenue, enhanced efficiencies, or increased market share, or the benefits may ultimately be smaller than we expected. these events could adversely affect our operating results or financial condition.  if our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets become impaired we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0we acquire other companies and intangible assets and may not realize all the economic benefit from those acquisitions, which could cause an impairment of goodwill or intangibles. we review our amortizable intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. we test goodwill for impairment at least annually. factors that may be a change in circumstances, indicating that the carrying value of our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets may not be recoverable, include a decline in our stock price and market capitalization, reduced future cash flow estimates, and slower growth rates in industry segments in which we participate. we may be required to record a significant charge in our consolidated financial statements during the period in which any impairment of our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets is determined, negatively affecting our results of operations. for example, in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2012, we recorded a $6.2 billion charge for the impairment of goodwill in our previous online services division business (devices and consumer other under our current segment structure), and in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2015, we recorded a $5.1 billion charge for the impairment of goodwill and a $2.2 billion charge for the impairment of intangible assets in our phone hardware segment.  \u00a0 20  table of contents  \u00a0 part i  item 1a  \u00a0 we may not earn the revenues we expect from our intellectual property rights.  we may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property rights  protecting our global intellectual property rights and combating unlicensed copying and use of our software and other intellectual property is difficult. while piracy adversely affects u.s. revenue, the impact on revenue from outside the u.s. is more significant, particularly in countries where laws are less protective of intellectual property rights. our revenue in these markets may grow slower than the underlying device market. similarly, the absence of harmonized patent laws makes it more difficult to ensure consistent respect for patent rights. throughout the world, we educate consumers about the benefits of licensing genuine products and obtaining indemnification benefits for intellectual property risks, and we educate lawmakers about the advantages of a business climate where intellectual property rights are protected. reductions in the legal protection for software intellectual property rights could adversely affect revenue.  we may not receive expected royalties from our patent licenses  we expend significant resources to patent the intellectual property we create with the expectation that we will generate revenues by incorporating that intellectual property in our products or services or, in some instances, by licensing our patents to others in return for a royalty.\u00a0changes in the law may weaken our ability to prevent the use of patented technology or collect revenue for licensing our patents.\u00a0these include legislative changes and regulatory actions that make it more difficult to obtain injunctions, and the increasing use of legal process to challenge issued patents. similarly, licensees of our patents may fail to satisfy their obligations to pay us royalties, or may contest the scope and extent of their obligations. finally, the royalties we can obtain to monetize our intellectual property may decline because of the evolution of technology, selling price changes in products using licensed patents, or the difficulty of discovering infringements.  third parties may claim we infringe their intellectual property rights.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0from time to time, others claim we infringe their intellectual property rights. the number of these claims may grow because of constant technological change in the markets in which we compete, the extensive patent coverage of existing technologies, the rapid rate of issuance of new patents, and our offering of first-party devices, such as surface and lumia phones. to resolve these claims we may enter into royalty and licensing agreements on terms that are less favorable than currently available, stop selling or redesign affected products or services, or pay damages to satisfy indemnification commitments with our customers. these outcomes may cause operating margins to decline. besides money damages, in some jurisdictions plaintiffs can seek injunctive relief that may limit or prevent importing, marketing, and selling our products or services that have infringing technologies. in some countries, such as germany, an injunction can be issued before the parties have fully litigated the validity of the underlying patents. we have paid significant amounts to settle claims related to the use of technology and intellectual property rights and to procure intellectual property rights as part of our strategy to manage this risk, and may continue to do so.  we may not be able to protect our source code from copying if there is an unauthorized disclosure of source code.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0source code, the detailed program commands for our operating systems and other software programs, is critical to our business. although we license portions of our application and operating system source code to several licensees, we take significant measures to protect the secrecy of large portions of our source code. if a significant portion of our source code leaks, we might lose future trade secret protection for that source code. it may become easier for third parties to compete with our products by copying functionality, which could adversely affect our revenue and operating margins. unauthorized disclosure of source code also could increase the security risks described in the next paragraph.  \u00a0 21  table of contents  \u00a0 part i  item 1a  \u00a0 cyber-attacks and security vulnerabilities could lead to reduced revenue, increased costs, liability claims, or harm to our competitive position.  security of microsoft\u0092s information technology  threats to it security can take a variety of forms. individual and groups of hackers, and sophisticated organizations including state-sponsored organizations or nation-states themselves, may take steps that pose threats to our customers and our it.\u00a0they may develop and deploy malicious software to attack our products and services and gain access to our networks and datacenters, or act in a coordinated manner to launch distributed denial of service or other coordinated attacks. cyber threats are constantly evolving, thereby increasing the difficulty of detecting and successfully defending against them. cyber threats can have cascading impacts that unfold with increasing speed across our internal networks and systems, and those of our partners and customers. breaches of our network or data security could disrupt the security of our internal systems and business applications, impair our ability to provide services to our customers and protect the privacy of their data, result in product development delays, compromise confidential or technical business information harming our competitive position, result in theft or misuse of our intellectual property or other assets, require us to allocate more resources to improved technologies, or otherwise adversely affect our business.  in addition, our internal it environment continues to evolve. often we are early adopters of new devices and technologies. we embrace new ways of sharing data and communicating internally and with partners and customers using methods such as social networking and other consumer-oriented technologies. our business policies and internal security controls may not keep pace with these changes as new threats emerge.  security of our products, services, devices, and customers\u0092 data  security threats are a particular challenge to companies like us whose business is technology products and services. threats to our own it infrastructure can also affect our customers. customers using our cloud-based services rely on the security of our infrastructure to ensure the reliability of our services and the protection of their data. hackers tend to focus their efforts on the most popular operating systems, programs, and services, including many of ours, and we expect that to continue. the security of our products and services is important in our customers\u0092 purchasing decisions.  to defend against security threats, both to our internal it systems and those of our customers, we must continuously engineer more secure products and services, enhance security and reliability features, improve the deployment of software updates to address security vulnerabilities, develop mitigation technologies that help to secure customers from attacks even when software updates are not deployed, maintain the digital security infrastructure that protects the integrity of our network, products, and services, and provide customers security tools such as firewalls and anti-virus software.  the cost of these steps could reduce our operating margins. if we fail to do these things well, actual or perceived security vulnerabilities in our products and services could harm our reputation and lead customers to reduce or delay future purchases of products or subscriptions to services, or to use competing products or services. customers may also spend more on protecting their existing computer systems from attack, which could delay adoption of additional products or services. customers may fail to update their systems, continue to run software or operating systems we no longer support, or may fail timely to install security patches. any of these actions by customers could adversely affect our revenue. actual or perceived vulnerabilities may lead to claims against us. although our license agreements typically contain provisions that eliminate or limit our exposure to liability, there is no assurance these provisions will withstand legal challenges. legislative or regulatory action in these areas may increase the costs to develop, implement, or secure our products and services.  disclosure of personal data could cause liability and harm our reputation.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0as we continue to grow the number and scale of our cloud-based offerings, we store and process increasingly large amounts of personally identifiable information of our customers. the continued occurrence of high-profile data breaches provides evidence of an external environment increasingly hostile to information security. despite our efforts to improve the security controls across our business groups and geographies, it is possible our security controls over personal data, our  \u00a0 22  table of contents  \u00a0 part i  item 1a  \u00a0  training of employees and vendors on data security, and other practices we follow may not prevent the improper disclosure of customer data we or our vendors store and manage. improper disclosure could harm our reputation, lead to legal exposure to customers, or subject us to liability under laws that protect personal data, resulting in increased costs or loss of revenue. our software products and services also enable our customers to store and process personal data on-premises or, increasingly, in a cloud-based environment we host. government authorities can sometimes require us to produce customer data in response to valid legal orders. in the u.s. and elsewhere, we advocate for transparency concerning these requests and appropriate limitations on government authority to compel disclosure. despite our efforts to protect customer data, perceptions that the privacy of personal information is not satisfactorily protected could inhibit sales of our products or services, and could limit adoption of our cloud-based solutions by consumers, businesses, and government entities. additional security measures we may take to address customer concerns, or constraints on our flexibility to determine where and how to operate datacenters in response to customer expectations or governmental rules or actions, may cause higher operating expenses.  we may have outages, data losses, and disruptions of our online services if we fail to maintain an adequate operations infrastructure.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0our increasing user traffic, growth in services, and the complexity of our products and services demand more computing power. we spend substantial amounts to build, purchase, or lease datacenters and equipment and to upgrade our technology and network infrastructure to handle more traffic on our websites and in our datacenters. these demands continue to increase as we introduce new products and services and support the growth of existing services such as bing, exchange online, office 365, sharepoint online, onedrive, skype, xbox live, microsoft azure, outlook.com, windows stores, and microsoft account services. we are rapidly growing our business of providing a platform and back-end hosting for services provided by third\u00a0parties to their end users. maintaining, securing, and expanding this infrastructure is expensive and complex. it requires that we maintain an internet connectivity infrastructure that is robust and reliable within competitive and regulatory constraints that continue to evolve. inefficiencies or operational failures, including temporary or permanent loss of customer data or insufficient internet connectivity, could diminish the quality of our products, services, and user experience resulting in contractual liability, claims by customers and other third parties, damage to our reputation and loss of current and potential users, subscribers, and advertisers, each of which may harm our operating results and financial condition.  government litigation and regulatory activity relating to competition rules may limit how we design and market our products.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0as a leading global software and device maker, we are closely scrutinized by government agencies under u.s. and foreign competition laws. an increasing number of governments are regulating competition law activities and this includes increased scrutiny in potentially large markets such as the european union, the u.s., and china. some jurisdictions also allow competitors or consumers to assert claims of anti-competitive conduct. u.s. federal and state antitrust authorities have previously brought enforcement actions and continue to scrutinize our business.  the european commission (\u0093the commission\u0094) closely scrutinizes the design of high-volume microsoft products and the terms on which we make certain technologies used in these products, such as file formats, programming interfaces, and protocols, available to other companies. in 2004, the commission ordered us to create new versions of our windows operating system that do not include certain multimedia technologies and to provide our competitors with specifications for how to implement certain proprietary windows communications protocols in their own products. in 2009, the commission accepted a set of commitments offered by microsoft to address the commission\u0092s concerns relating to competition in web browsing software, including an undertaking to address commission concerns relating to interoperability. the web browsing commitments expired in 2014. the remaining obligations may limit our ability to innovate in windows or other products in the future, diminish the developer appeal of the windows platform, and increase our product development costs. the availability of licenses related to protocols and file formats may enable competitors to develop software products that better mimic the functionality of our products, which could hamper sales of our\u00a0products.  our portfolio of first-party devices continues to grow; at the same time our oem partners offer a large variety of devices on our platforms. as a result, increasingly we both cooperate and compete with our oem partners, creating a risk that we fail to do so in compliance with competition rules. regulatory scrutiny in this area may increase. certain foreign governments, particularly in china and other countries in asia, have advanced arguments under their competition laws that exert downward pressure on royalties for our intellectual property. because these jurisdictions only recently implemented competition laws, their enforcement activities are unpredictable.  \u00a0 23  table of contents  \u00a0 part i  item 1a  \u00a0 government regulatory actions and court decisions such as these may hinder our ability to provide the benefits of our software to consumers and businesses, reducing the attractiveness of our products and the revenue that come from them. new competition law actions could be initiated. the outcome of such actions, or steps taken to avoid them, could adversely affect us in a variety of ways, including:  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 our global operations subject us to potential liability under anti-corruption, trade protection, and other laws and regulations.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0the foreign corrupt practices act and other anti-corruption laws and regulations (\u0093anti-corruption laws\u0094) prohibit corrupt payments by our employees, vendors, or agents. from time to time, we receive inquiries from authorities in the u.s. and elsewhere about our business activities outside the u.s. and our compliance with anti-corruption laws. while we devote substantial resources to our global compliance programs and have implemented policies, training, and internal controls designed to reduce the risk of corrupt payments, our employees, vendors, or agents may violate our policies. our failure to comply with anti-corruption laws could result in significant fines and penalties, criminal sanctions against us, our officers, or our employees, prohibitions on the conduct of our business, and damage to our reputation. operations outside the u.s. may be affected by changes in trade protection laws, policies, and measures, and other regulatory requirements affecting trade and investment. we may be subject to legal liability and reputational damage if we sell goods or services in violation of u.s. trade sanctions on countries such as iran, north korea, cuba, sudan, and syria.  other regulatory areas that may apply to our products and online services offerings include user privacy, telecommunications, data storage and protection, and online content. for example, regulators may take the position that our offerings such as skype are covered by laws regulating telecommunications services. applying these laws and regulations to our business is often unclear, subject to change over time, and sometimes may conflict from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. additionally, these laws and governments\u0092 approach to their enforcement, and our products and services, are continuing to evolve. increasing concern about government surveillance practices around the world may lead to increased regulation requiring local data hosting obligations or the use of domestic hosting providers. compliance with these types of regulation may involve significant costs or require changes in products or business practices that result in reduced revenue. noncompliance could result in the imposition of penalties or orders we stop the alleged noncompliant activity. geopolitical instability may lead to sanctions and impact our ability to do business in some geographies.  our business depends on our ability to attract and retain talented employees.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0our business is based on successfully attracting and retaining talented employees. the market for highly skilled workers and leaders in our industry is extremely competitive. we are limited in our ability to recruit internationally by restrictive domestic immigration laws. if we are less successful in our recruiting efforts, or if we cannot retain key employees, our ability to develop and deliver successful products and services may be adversely affected. effective succession planning is also important to our long-term success. failure to ensure effective transfer of knowledge and smooth transitions involving key employees could hinder our strategic planning and execution.  we have claims and lawsuits against us that may result in adverse outcomes.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0we are subject to a variety of claims and lawsuits. adverse outcomes in some or all of these claims may result in significant monetary damages or injunctive relief that could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business. the litigation and other claims are  \u00a0 24  table of contents  \u00a0 part i  item 1a  \u00a0  subject to inherent uncertainties and management\u0092s view of these matters may change in the future. a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements could occur for the period in which the effect of an unfavorable final outcome becomes probable and reasonably estimable.  we may have additional tax liabilities.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0we are subject to income taxes in the u.s. and many foreign jurisdictions. significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes. in the ordinary course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. we regularly are under audit by tax authorities. economic\u00a0and political\u00a0pressures to increase tax revenue in various jurisdictions may make resolving tax disputes favorably more difficult. although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals. the results of an audit or litigation could have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements in the period or periods in which that determination is made.  we earn a significant amount of our operating income from outside the u.s., and any repatriation of funds currently held in foreign jurisdictions to the u.s. may result in higher effective tax rates for the company. in addition, there have been proposals from congress to change u.s. tax laws that would significantly impact how u.s. multinational corporations are taxed on foreign earnings. although we cannot predict whether or in what form any proposed legislation may pass, if enacted, it could have a material adverse impact on our tax expense and cash flows.  our hardware and software products may experience quality or supply problems.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0our vertically-integrated hardware products such as xbox consoles, surface devices, phones, and other devices we design, manufacture, and market are highly complex and can have defects in design, manufacture, or associated software. we could incur significant expenses, lost revenue, and reputational harm if we fail to detect or address such issues through design, testing, or warranty repairs. we acquire some device components from sole suppliers. our competitors use some of the same suppliers and their demand for hardware components can affect the capacity available to us. if a component from a sole-source supplier is delayed or becomes unavailable, whether because of supplier capacity constraint or industry shortages, we may not obtain timely replacement supplies, resulting in reduced sales. component shortages, excess or obsolete inventory, or price reductions resulting in inventory adjustments may increase our cost of revenue. xbox consoles, surface devices, phones, and other hardware are assembled in asia and other geographies that may be subject to disruptions in the supply chain, resulting in shortages that would affect our revenue and operating margins. these same risks would apply to any other vertically-integrated hardware and software products we may offer.  our software products also may experience quality or reliability problems. the highly sophisticated software products we develop may contain bugs and other defects that interfere with their intended operation. any defects we do not detect and fix in pre-release testing could cause reduced sales and revenue, damage to our reputation, repair or remediation costs, delays in the release of new products or versions, or legal liability. although our license agreements typically contain provisions that eliminate or limit our exposure to liability, there is no assurance these provisions will withstand legal challenge.  our global business exposes us to operational and economic risks.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0our customers are located in over 200 countries and a significant part of our revenue comes from international sales. the global nature of our business creates operational and economic risks. emerging markets are a significant focus of our international growth strategy. the developing nature of these markets presents several risks, including deterioration of social, political, labor, or economic conditions in a country or region, and difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations. although we hedge a portion of our international currency exposure, significant fluctuations in foreign exchange rates between the u.s. dollar and foreign currencies may adversely affect our revenue. competitive or regulatory pressure to make our pricing structure uniform might require that we reduce the sales price of our software in the u.s. and other countries.  catastrophic events or geopolitical conditions may disrupt our business.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0a disruption or failure of our systems or operations because of a major earthquake, weather event, cyber-attack, terrorist attack, or other catastrophic event could cause delays in completing sales, providing services, or performing other critical functions. our corporate headquarters, a significant portion of our research and development activities, and certain other essential business operations are in the seattle, washington area, and we have other business operations in the  \u00a0 25  table of contents  \u00a0 part ii  item 7  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 industry trends  our industry is dynamic and highly competitive, with frequent changes in both technologies and business models. each industry shift is an opportunity to conceive new products, new technologies, or new ideas that can further transform the industry and our business. at microsoft, we push the boundaries of what is possible through a broad range of research and development activities that seek to identify and address the changing demands of customers, industry trends, and competitive forces.  economic conditions, challenges, and risks  the market for software, devices, and cloud-based services is dynamic and highly competitive. our competitors are developing new software and devices, while also deploying competing cloud-based services for consumers and businesses. the devices and form factors customers prefer evolve rapidly, and influence how users access services in the cloud, and in some cases, the user\u0092s choice of which suite of cloud-based services to use. we must continue to evolve and adapt over an extended time in pace with this changing environment. the investments we are making in devices and infrastructure will increase our operating costs and may decrease our operating margins.  our success is highly dependent on our ability to attract and retain qualified employees. we hire a mix of university and industry talent worldwide. microsoft competes for talented individuals globally by offering an exceptional working environment, broad customer reach, scale in resources, the ability to grow one\u0092s career across many different products and businesses, and competitive compensation and benefits. aggregate demand for our software, services, and devices is correlated to global macroeconomic and geopolitical factors, which remain dynamic.  our international operations provide a significant portion of our total revenue and expenses. many of these revenue and expenses are denominated in currencies other than the u.s. dollar. as a result, changes in foreign exchange rates may significantly affect revenue and expenses. recently, the significant strengthening of the u.s. dollar relative to certain foreign currencies has negatively impacted reported revenue and reduced reported expenses from our international operations. \u00a0 30  table of contents  \u00a0 part ii  item 7  \u00a0 see a discussion of these factors and other risks under risk factors (part i, item\u00a01a of this form 10-k).  seasonality  our revenue historically has fluctuated quarterly and has generally been highest in the second quarter of our fiscal year due to corporate calendar year-end spending trends in our major markets and holiday season spending by consumers. our computing and gaming hardware segment is particularly seasonal as its products are aimed at the consumer market and are in highest demand during the holiday shopping season. typically, the computing and gaming hardware segment has generated approximately 40-50% of its yearly revenue in our second fiscal quarter.  unearned revenue  quarterly and annual revenue may be impacted by the deferral of revenue, including:  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 if our customers choose to license cloud-based versions of our products and services rather than licensing transaction-based products and services, the associated revenue will shift from being recognized at the time of the transaction to being recognized over the subscription period or upon consumption, as applicable.  reportable segments  the segment amounts included in md&a are presented on a basis consistent with our internal management reporting. segment information appearing in note 22 \u0096 segment information and geographic data of the notes to financial statements (part ii, item\u00a08 of this form 10-k) is also presented on this basis. all differences between our internal management reporting basis and accounting principles generally accepted in the united states (\u0093u.s. gaap\u0094), along with certain corporate-level and other activity, are included in corporate and other. operating expenses are not allocated to our segments. we have recast certain prior period amounts to conform to the current period presentation, with no impact on consolidated net income or cash flows.  on april\u00a025, 2014, we acquired substantially all of nokia corporation\u0092s (\u0093nokia\u0094) devices and services business (\u0093nds\u0094). nds has been included in our consolidated results of operations since the acquisition date. we report the financial performance of the acquired business in our phone hardware segment. prior to the acquisition of nds, financial results associated with our joint strategic initiatives with nokia were reflected in our devices and consumer (\u0093d&c\u0094) licensing segment. the contractual relationship with nokia related to those initiatives ended in conjunction with the acquisition.  our reportable segments are described below.  devices and consumer  our d&c segments develop, manufacture, market, and support products and services designed to entertain and connect people, increase personal productivity, help people simplify tasks and make more informed decisions online, and help advertisers connect with audiences. our d&c segments are:  \u00a0 \u00a0 31  table of contents  \u00a0 part ii  item 7  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 commercial  our commercial segments develop, market, and support software and services designed to increase individual, team, and organizational productivity and efficiency, including simplifying everyday tasks through seamless operations across the user\u0092s hardware and software. our commercial segments are:  \u00a0 \u00a0 summary results of operations  \u00a0 fiscal year 2015 compared with fiscal year 2014  revenue increased $6.7 billion or 8%, reflecting a full year of phone hardware sales and growth in revenue from our commercial cloud, surface, server products, search advertising, and xbox live transactions. these increases were offset in part by a decline in revenue from office commercial, windows oem, licensing of windows phone operating system, and office consumer. revenue included an unfavorable foreign currency impact of approximately 2%.  gross margin increased $787 million or 1%, primarily due to higher revenue, offset in part by a $6.0 billion or 22% increase in cost of revenue. cost of revenue increased, mainly due to phone hardware, as well as increasing costs in support of our commercial cloud, including

2014  our effective tax rate for fiscal years 2015 and 2014 was approximately 34% and 21%, respectively. the fiscal year 2015 effective rate increased by 13%, primarily due to goodwill and asset impairments and restructuring charges recorded in fiscal year 2015, most of which did not generate a tax benefit. our effective tax rate was lower than the u.s. federal statutory rate primarily due to foreign earnings taxed at lower rates resulting from producing and distributing our products and services through our foreign regional operations centers in ireland, singapore, and puerto rico. in fiscal year 2015, this reduction was mostly offset by losses in foreign jurisdictions for which we may not realize a tax benefit, primarily as a result of impairment and restructuring charges.  \u00a0 41  table of contents  \u00a0 part ii  item 7  \u00a0 changes in the mix of income before income taxes between the u.s. and foreign countries also impacted our effective tax rates and resulted

operating center, while we supply the microsoft office system and our server products and tools to customers through our foreign regional operations centers. in fiscal years 2015 and 2014, our u.s.

income before income taxes was $11.1 billion and $20.7 billion, respectively, and comprised 60% and 74%, respectively, of our income before income taxes.  tax contingencies and other income tax liabilities were $12.1 billion and $10.4 billion as of june\u00a030, 2015 and 2014, respectively, and are included in other long-term liabilities. this increase relates primarily to adjustments to prior years\u0092 liabilities for intercompany transfer pricing and adjustments related to our irs audits. while we settled a portion of the i.r.s. audit for tax years 2004 to 2006 during the third quarter of fiscal year 2011, we remain under audit for those years. in february 2012, the i.r.s. withdrew its 2011 revenue agents report and reopened the audit phase of the examination. as of june\u00a030, 2015, the primary unresolved issue relates to transfer pricing, which could have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements if not resolved favorably. we believe our allowances for income tax contingencies are adequate. we have not received a proposed assessment for the unresolved issues and do not expect a final resolution of these issues in the next 12 months.\u00a0based on the information currently available, we do not anticipate a significant increase or decrease to our tax contingencies for these issues within the next 12 months. we also continue to be subject to examination by the i.r.s. for tax years 2007 to 2015.  we are subject to income tax in many jurisdictions outside the u.s. our operations in certain jurisdictions remain subject to examination for tax years 1996 to 2015, some of which are currently under audit by local tax authorities. the resolutions of these audits are not expected to be material to our consolidated financial statements.  fiscal year 2014 compared with fiscal year 2013  our effective tax rate for fiscal years 2014 and 2013 was approximately 21% and 19%, respectively. our effective tax rate was lower than the u.s. federal statutory rate primarily due to earnings taxed at lower rates in foreign jurisdictions resulting from producing and distributing our products and services through our foreign regional operations centers in ireland, singapore, and puerto rico.  our fiscal year 2014 effective rate increased by 2% from fiscal year 2013 mainly due to adjustments of $458 million to prior years\u0092 liabilities for intercompany transfer pricing that increased taxable income in more highly taxed jurisdictions, as well as losses incurred by nds and changes in the geographic mix of our business. this was offset in part by favorable transfer pricing developments in certain foreign tax jurisdictions, primarily denmark.  changes in the mix of income before income taxes between the u.s. and foreign countries also impacted our effective tax rates and resulted primarily from changes in the geographic distribution of and changes in consumer demand for our products and services. we supply our windows pc operating system to customers through our u.s. regional operating center, while we supply the microsoft office system and our server products and tools to customers through our foreign regional operations centers. windows pc operating system revenue decreased $655 million in fiscal year 2014, while microsoft office system and server products and tools revenue increased $1.3 billion

liquid investment-grade fixed-income securities, diversified among industries and individual issuers. the investments are predominantly u.s. dollar-denominated securities, but also include foreign currency-denominated securities in order to diversify risk. our fixed-income investments are exposed to interest rate risk and credit risk. the credit risk and average maturity of our fixed-income portfolio are managed to achieve economic returns that correlate to certain fixed-income indices. the settlement risk related to these investments is insignificant given that the short-term investments held are primarily highly liquid investment-grade fixed-income securities.  of the cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments at june\u00a030, 2015, $94.4 billion was held by our foreign subsidiaries and would be subject to material repatriation tax effects. the amount of cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments held by foreign subsidiaries subject to other restrictions on the free flow of funds (primarily currency and other local regulatory) was $2.1 billion. as of june\u00a030, 2015, approximately 79% of the cash equivalents and short-term investments held by our foreign subsidiaries were invested in u.s. government and agency securities, approximately 5% were invested in corporate notes and bonds of u.s. companies, and approximately 5% were invested in u.s. mortgage- and asset-backed securities, all of which are denominated in u.s. dollars.  securities lending  we lend certain fixed-income and equity securities to increase investment returns. the loaned securities continue to be carried as investments on our balance sheet. cash and/or security interests are received as collateral for the loaned securities with the amount determined based upon the underlying security lent and the creditworthiness of the borrower. cash received is recorded as an asset with a corresponding liability. our securities lending payable balance was $92 million as of june\u00a030, 2015. our average and maximum securities lending payable balances for the fiscal year were $287 million and $750 million, respectively. intra-year variances in the amount of securities loaned are mainly due to fluctuations in the demand for the securities.  valuation  in general, and where applicable, we use quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities to determine the fair value of our financial instruments. this pricing methodology applies to our level 1 investments, such as exchange-traded mutual funds, domestic and international equities, and u.s. government securities. if quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities are not available to determine fair value, then we use quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities or inputs other than the quoted prices that are observable either directly or indirectly. this pricing methodology applies to our level 2 investments such as corporate notes and bonds, common and preferred stock, foreign government bonds, mortgage- and asset-backed securities, u.s. government and agency securities, and certificates of deposit. level 3 investments are valued using internally developed models with unobservable inputs. assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis using unobservable inputs are an immaterial portion of our portfolio.  a majority of our investments are priced by pricing vendors and are generally level 1 or level 2 investments as these vendors either provide a quoted market price in an active market or use observable inputs for their pricing without applying significant adjustments. broker pricing is used mainly when a quoted price is not available, the investment is not priced by our pricing vendors, or when a broker price is more reflective of fair values in the market in which the investment trades. our broker-priced investments are generally classified as level 2 investments because the broker prices these investments based on similar assets without applying significant adjustments. in addition, all of our broker-priced investments have a sufficient level of trading volume to demonstrate that the fair values used are appropriate for these investments. our fair value processes include controls that are designed to ensure appropriate fair values are recorded. these controls include model validation, review of key model inputs, analysis of period-over-period fluctuations, and independent recalculation of prices where appropriate.  \u00a0 43  table of contents  \u00a0 part ii  item 7  \u00a0 cash flows  fiscal year 2015 compared with fiscal year 2014  cash flows from operations decreased $3.2 billion during the fiscal year to $29.1 billion, mainly due to an increase in materials and production costs in support of sales growth as well as payments related to restructuring charges and other changes in working capital, offset in part by increases in cash received from customers. cash used in financing increased $686 million to $9.1 billion, mainly due to a $7.1 billion increase in cash used for common stock repurchases, offset in part by a $6.7 billion increase in proceeds from issuances of debt, net of repayments. cash used in investing increased $4.2 billion to $23.0 billion, mainly due to a $5.5 billion increase in cash used for net investment purchases, sales, and maturities, partially offset by a $2.2 billion decrease in cash used for acquisitions of companies and purchases of intangible and other assets.  fiscal year 2014 compared with fiscal year 2013  cash flows from operations increased $3.4 billion during fiscal year 2014 to $32.2 billion, mainly due to increases in cash received from customers. cash used in financing increased $246 million to $8.4 billion, mainly due to a $2.0 billion increase in cash used for common stock repurchases, a $1.4 billion increase in dividends paid, and a $324 million decrease in proceeds from the issuance of common stock, offset in part by a $3.4 billion increase in proceeds from issuances of debt, net of repayments. cash used in investing decreased $5.0 billion to $18.8 billion, mainly due to a $10.5 billion decrease in cash used for net investment purchases, sales, and maturities, offset in part by a $4.4 billion increase in cash used for acquisition of companies and purchases of intangible and other assets, and a $1.2 billion increase in capital expenditures for property and equipment.  debt  we issued debt to take advantage of favorable pricing and liquidity in the debt markets, reflecting our credit rating and the low interest rate environment. the proceeds of these issuances were or will be used for general corporate purposes, which may include, among other things, funding for working capital, capital expenditures, repurchases of capital stock, acquisitions, and repayment of existing debt. see note 12 \u0096 debt of the notes to financial statements (part ii, item 8 of this form 10-k for further discussion.  unearned revenue  unearned revenue at june\u00a030, 2015 was comprised mainly of unearned revenue from volume licensing programs. unearned revenue from volume licensing programs represents customer billings for multi-year licensing arrangements paid for either at inception of the agreement or annually at the beginning of each coverage period and accounted for as subscriptions with revenue recognized ratably over the coverage period. unearned revenue at june\u00a030, 2015 also included payments for: post-delivery support and consulting services to be performed in the future; xbox live subscriptions and prepaid points; microsoft dynamics business solutions products; office 365 subscriptions; skype prepaid credits and subscriptions; bundled offerings; and other offerings for which we have been paid in advance and earn the revenue when we provide the service or software, or otherwise meet the revenue recognition criteria.  the following table outlines the expected future recognition of unearned revenue as of june\u00a030, 2015:  \u00a0 \u00a0 44  table of contents  \u00a0 part ii  item 7  \u00a0 share repurchases  on september\u00a016, 2013, our board of directors approved a share repurchase program authorizing up to $40.0 billion in share repurchases. the share repurchase program became effective on october\u00a01, 2013, has no expiration date, and may be suspended or discontinued at any time without notice. while the program has no expiration date, we intend to complete it by december\u00a031, 2016. as of june\u00a030, 2015, $21.9 billion remained of our $40.0 billion share repurchase program.  during fiscal year 2015, we repurchased 295\u00a0million shares of microsoft common stock for $13.2 billion under the share repurchase program approved by our board of directors on september\u00a016, 2013. during fiscal year 2014, we repurchased 175\u00a0million shares for $6.4 billion; 128\u00a0million shares were repurchased for $4.9 billion under the share repurchase program approved by our board of directors on september\u00a016, 2013, and 47\u00a0million shares were repurchased for $1.5 billion under the share repurchase program that was announced on september\u00a022, 2008 and expired september\u00a030, 2013. during fiscal year 2013, we repurchased 158\u00a0million shares for $4.6 billion, under the share repurchase program announced on september\u00a022, 2008. all repurchases were made using cash resources.  dividends  see note 19 \u0096 stockholders\u0092 equity of the notes to financial statements (part ii, item 8 of this form 10-k) for further discussion.  off-balance sheet arrangements  we provide indemnifications of varying scope and size to certain customers against claims of intellectual property infringement made by third parties arising from the use of our products and certain other matters. in evaluating estimated losses on these indemnifications, we consider factors such as the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and our ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss. these obligations did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements during the periods presented.  contractual obligations  the following table summarizes the payments due by fiscal year for our outstanding contractual obligations as of june\u00a030, 2015:  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 45  table of contents  \u00a0 part ii  item 7  \u00a0 other planned uses of capital  we will continue to invest in sales, marketing, product support infrastructure, and existing and advanced areas of technology, as well as continue making acquisitions that align with our business strategy. additions to property and equipment will continue, including new facilities, data centers, and computer systems for research and development, sales and marketing, support, and administrative staff. we expect capital expenditures to increase in coming years in support of our productivity and platform strategy. we have operating leases for most u.s. and international sales and support offices and certain equipment. we have not engaged in any related party transactions or arrangements with unconsolidated entities or other persons that are reasonably likely to materially affect liquidity or the availability of capital resources.  liquidity  we earn a significant amount of our operating income outside the u.s., which is deemed to be permanently reinvested in foreign jurisdictions. as a result, as discussed above under cash, cash equivalents, and investments, the majority of our cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments are held by foreign subsidiaries. we currently do not intend nor foresee a need to repatriate these funds. we expect existing domestic cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, cash flows from operations, and access to capital markets to continue to be sufficient to fund our domestic operating activities and cash commitments for investing and financing activities, such as regular quarterly dividends, debt maturities, and material capital expenditures, for at least the next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future. in addition, we expect existing foreign cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, and cash flows from operations to continue to be sufficient to fund our foreign operating activities and cash commitments for investing activities, such as material capital expenditures, for at least the next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future.  should we require more capital in the u.s. than is generated by our operations domestically, for example to fund significant discretionary activities, such as business acquisitions and share repurchases, we could elect to repatriate future earnings from foreign jurisdictions or raise capital in the u.s. through debt or equity issuances. these alternatives could result in higher effective tax rates, increased interest expense, or dilution of our earnings. we have borrowed funds domestically and continue to believe we have the ability to do so at reasonable interest rates.  recent accounting guidance  see note 1 \u0096 accounting policies of the notes to financial statements (part ii, item 8 of this form 10-k) for further discussion.  application of critical accounting policies  our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with u.s. gaap. preparing consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. these estimates and assumptions are affected by management\u0092s application of accounting policies. critical accounting policies for us include revenue recognition, impairment of investment securities, goodwill, research and development costs, contingencies, income taxes, and inventories.  revenue recognition  revenue recognition for multiple-element arrangements requires judgment to determine if multiple elements exist, whether elements can be accounted for as separate units of accounting, and if so, the fair value for each of the elements.  judgment is also required to assess whether future releases of certain software represent new products or upgrades and enhancements to existing products. certain volume licensing arrangements include a perpetual license for current products combined with rights to receive unspecified future versions of software products and are accounted for as subscriptions, with billings recorded as unearned revenue and recognized as revenue ratably over the coverage period.  \u00a0 46  table of contents  \u00a0 part ii  item 7  \u00a0 software updates are evaluated on a case-by-case basis to determine whether they meet the definition of an upgrade, which may require revenue to be deferred and recognized when the upgrade is delivered. if it is determined that implied post-contract customer support (\u0093pcs\u0094) is being provided, revenue from the arrangement is deferred and recognized over the implied pcs term. if updates are determined to not meet the definition of an upgrade, revenue is generally recognized as products are shipped or made available.  microsoft enters into arrangements that can include various combinations of software, services, and hardware. where elements are delivered over different periods of time, and when allowed under u.s. gaap, revenue is allocated to the respective elements based on their relative selling prices at the inception of the arrangement, and revenue is recognized as each element is delivered. we use a hierarchy to determine the fair value to be used for allocating revenue to elements: (i)\u00a0vendor-specific objective evidence of fair value (\u0093vsoe\u0094), (ii)\u00a0third-party evidence, and (iii)\u00a0best estimate of selling price (\u0093esp\u0094). for software elements, we follow the industry specific software guidance which only allows for the use of vsoe in establishing fair value. generally, vsoe is the price charged when the deliverable is sold separately or the price established by management for a product that is not yet sold if it is probable that the price will not change before introduction into the marketplace. esps are established as best estimates of what the selling prices would be if the deliverables were sold regularly on a stand-alone basis. our process for determining esps requires judgment and considers multiple factors that may vary over time depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each deliverable.  in january 2015, we announced windows 10 will be free to all qualified existing users of windows 7 and windows\u00a08.1. this offer differs from historical offers preceding the launch of new versions of windows as it is being made available for free to existing users in addition to new customers after the offer announcement. we evaluated the nature and accounting treatment of the windows 10 offer and determined that it represents a marketing and promotional activity, in part because the offer is being made available for free to existing users. as this is a marketing and promotional activity, revenue recognition of new sales of windows 8 will continue to be recognized as delivered.  impairment of investment securities  we review investments quarterly for indicators of other-than-temporary impairment. this determination requires significant judgment. in making this judgment, we employ a systematic methodology quarterly that considers available quantitative and qualitative evidence in evaluating potential impairment of our investments. if the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value, we evaluate, among other factors, general market conditions, credit quality of debt instrument issuers, the duration and extent to which the fair value is less than cost, and for equity securities, our intent and ability to hold, or plans to sell, the investment. for fixed-income securities, we also evaluate whether we have plans to sell the security or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery. we also consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of and business outlook for the investee, including industry and sector performance, changes in technology, and operational and financing cash flow factors. once a decline in fair value is determined to be other-than-temporary, an impairment charge is recorded to other income (expense), net and a new cost basis in the investment is established. if market, industry, and/or investee conditions deteriorate, we may incur future impairments.  goodwill  we allocate goodwill to reporting units based on the reporting unit expected to benefit from the business combination. we evaluate our reporting units on an annual basis and, if necessary, reassign goodwill using a relative fair value allocation approach. goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level (operating segment or one level below an operating segment) on an annual basis (may 1 for us) and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. these events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate, legal factors, operating performance indicators, competition, or sale or disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit.  application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment, including the identification of reporting units, assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units, assignment of goodwill to reporting units, and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit. the fair value of each reporting unit is estimated primarily through the use of a  \u00a0 47  table of contents  \u00a0 part ii  item 7  \u00a0  discounted cash flow methodology. this analysis requires significant judgments, including estimation of future cash flows, which is dependent on internal forecasts, estimation of the long-term rate of growth for our business, estimation of the useful life over which cash flows will occur, and determination of our weighted average cost of capital.  the estimates used to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit change from year to year based on operating results, market conditions, and other factors. changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and goodwill impairment for each reporting unit.  based on the results of our annual goodwill impairment testing as of may\u00a01, 2015, we determined that goodwill associated with our phone hardware reporting unit was impaired, resulting in a material charge to earnings in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2015. as of june\u00a030, 2015, none of our reporting units were considered to be at risk of impairment.  research and development costs  costs incurred internally in researching and developing a computer software product are charged to expense until technological feasibility has been established for the product. once technological feasibility is established, all software costs are capitalized until the product is available for general release to customers. judgment is required in determining when technological feasibility of a product is established. we have determined that technological feasibility for our software products is reached after all high-risk development issues have been resolved through coding and testing. generally, this occurs shortly before the products are released to manufacturing. the amortization of these costs is included in cost of revenue over the estimated life of the products.  legal and other contingencies  the outcomes of legal proceedings and claims brought against us are subject to significant uncertainty. an estimated loss from a loss contingency such as a legal proceeding or claim is accrued by a charge to income if it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. in determining whether a loss should be accrued we evaluate, among other factors, the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss. changes in these factors could materially impact our consolidated financial statements.  income taxes  the objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entity\u0092s financial statements or tax returns. we recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. accounting literature also provides guidance on derecognition of income tax assets and liabilities, classification of current and deferred income tax assets and liabilities, accounting for interest and penalties associated with tax positions, and income tax disclosures. judgment is required in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements or tax returns. variations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could materially impact our consolidated financial statements.  \u00a0 48  table of contents  \u00a0 part ii  item 7  \u00a0 inventories  inventories are stated at average cost, subject to the lower of cost or market. cost includes materials, labor, and manufacturing overhead related to the purchase and production of inventories. we regularly review inventory quantities on hand, future purchase commitments with our suppliers, and the estimated utility of our inventory. these reviews include analysis of demand forecasts, product life cycle status, product development plans, current sales levels, pricing strategy, and component cost trends. if our review indicates a reduction in utility below carrying value, we reduce our inventory to a new cost basis through a charge to cost of revenue. the determination of market value and the estimated volume of demand used in the lower of cost or market analysis require significant judgment.  \u00a0 49  table of contents  \u00a0 part ii  item 7  \u00a0 statement of management\u0092s responsibility for financial statements  management is responsible for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements and related information that are presented in this report. the consolidated financial statements, which include amounts based on management\u0092s estimates and judgments, have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america.  the company designs and maintains accounting and internal control systems to provide reasonable assurance at reasonable cost that assets are safeguarded against loss from unauthorized use or disposition, and that the financial records are reliable for preparing consolidated financial statements and maintaining accountability for assets. these systems are augmented by written policies, an organizational structure providing division of responsibilities, careful selection and training of qualified personnel, and a program of internal audits.  the company engaged deloitte\u00a0& touche llp, an independent registered public accounting firm, to audit and render an opinion on the consolidated financial statements and internal control over financial reporting in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board (united states).  the board of directors, through its audit committee, consisting solely of independent directors of the company, meets periodically with management, internal auditors, and our independent registered public accounting firm to ensure that each is meeting its responsibilities and to discuss matters concerning internal controls and financial reporting. deloitte\u00a0& touche llp and the internal auditors each have full and free access to the audit committee.  \u00a0 \u00a0 50  table of contents  \u00a0 part ii  item 7a  \u00a0 item\u00a07a.\u00a0quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk  risks  we are exposed to economic risk from foreign exchange rates, interest rates, credit risk, equity prices, and commodity prices. a portion of these risks is hedged, but they may impact our consolidated financial statements.  foreign currency  certain forecasted transactions, assets, and liabilities are exposed to foreign currency risk. we monitor our foreign currency exposures daily and use hedges where practicable to offset the risks and maximize the economic effectiveness of our foreign currency positions. principal currencies hedged include the euro, japanese yen, british pound, canadian dollar, and australian dollar.  interest rate  our fixed-income portfolio is diversified across credit sectors and maturities, consisting primarily of investment-grade securities. the credit risk and average maturity of the fixed-income portfolio is managed to achieve economic returns that correlate to certain global and domestic fixed-income indices. in addition, we use \u0093to be announced\u0094 forward purchase commitments of mortgage-backed assets to gain exposure to agency mortgage-backed securities.  equity  our equity portfolio consists of global, developed, and emerging market securities that are subject to market price risk.\u00a0we manage the securities relative to certain global and domestic indices and expect their economic risk and return to correlate with these indices.  commodity  we use broad-based commodity exposures to enhance portfolio returns and facilitate portfolio diversification. our investment portfolio has exposure to a variety of commodities, including precious metals, energy, and grain. we manage these exposures relative to global commodity indices and expect their economic risk and return to correlate with these indices.  value-at-risk  we use a value-at-risk (\u0093var\u0094) model to estimate and quantify our market risks. var is the expected loss, for a given confidence level, in the fair value of our portfolio due to adverse market movements over a defined time horizon. the var model is not intended to represent actual losses in fair value, including determinations of other-than-temporary losses in fair value in accordance with u.s. gaap, but is used as a risk estimation and management tool. the distribution of the potential changes in total market value of all holdings is computed based on the historical volatilities and correlations among foreign exchange rates, interest rates, equity prices, and commodity prices, assuming normal market conditions.  the var is calculated as the total loss that will not be exceeded at the 97.5 percentile confidence level or, alternatively stated, the losses could exceed the var in 25 out of 1,000 cases. several risk factors are not captured in the model, including liquidity risk, operational risk, and legal risk.  \u00a0 51  table of contents  \u00a0 part ii  item 7a  \u00a0 the following table sets forth the one-day var for substantially all of our positions as of june\u00a030, 2015 and 2014 and for the year ended june\u00a030, 2015:  \u00a0 total one-day var for the combined risk categories was $237 million at june\u00a030, 2015 and $333 million at june\u00a030, 2014. the total var is 29% less at june\u00a030, 2015, and 25% less at june\u00a030, 2014, than the sum of the separate risk categories in the table above due to the diversification benefit of the combination of risks.  \u00a0 52  table of contents  \u00a0 part ii  item 8  \u00a0 comprehensive income statements  \u00a0 see accompanying notes.  \u00a0 54  table of contents  \u00a0 part ii  item 8  \u00a0 stockholders\u0092 equity statements  \u00a0 see accompanying notes.  \u00a0 57  table of contents  \u00a0 part ii  item 8  \u00a0 notes to financial statements  note 1 - accounting policies  accounting principles  the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america (\u0093u.s. gaap\u0094).  we have recast certain prior period amounts to conform to the current period presentation, with no impact on consolidated net income or cash flows.  principles of consolidation  the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of microsoft corporation and its subsidiaries. intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated. equity investments through which we are able to exercise significant influence over but do not control the investee and are not the primary beneficiary of the investee\u0092s activities are accounted for using the equity method. investments through which we are not able to exercise significant influence over the investee and which do not have readily determinable fair values are accounted for under the cost method.  estimates and assumptions  preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. examples of estimates include: loss contingencies; product warranties; the fair value of, and/or potential impairment of goodwill and intangibles assets, for our reporting units; product life cycles; useful lives of our tangible and intangible assets; allowances for doubtful accounts; allowances for product returns; the market value of our inventory; and stock-based compensation forfeiture rates. examples of assumptions include: the elements comprising a software arrangement, including the distinction between upgrades or enhancements and new products; when technological feasibility is achieved for our products; the potential outcome of future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements or tax returns; and determining when investment impairments are other-than-temporary. actual results and outcomes may differ from management\u0092s estimates and assumptions.  foreign currencies  assets and liabilities recorded in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rate on the balance sheet date. revenue and expenses are translated at average rates of exchange prevailing during the year. translation adjustments resulting from this process are recorded to other comprehensive income (\u0093oci\u0094).  revenue recognition  revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the fee is fixed or determinable, and collectability is probable. revenue generally is recognized net of allowances for returns and any taxes collected from customers and subsequently remitted to governmental authorities.  revenue recognition for multiple-element arrangements requires judgment to determine if multiple elements exist, whether elements can be accounted for as separate units of accounting, and if so, the fair value for each of the elements.  microsoft enters into arrangements that can include various combinations of software, services, and hardware. where elements are delivered over different periods of time, and when allowed under u.s. gaap, revenue is allocated to the respective elements based on their relative selling prices at the inception of the arrangement, and revenue is recognized as each element is delivered. we use a hierarchy to determine the fair value to be used for allocating revenue to elements: (i)\u00a0vendor-specific objective evidence of fair value (\u0093vsoe\u0094), (ii)\u00a0third-party evidence,  \u00a0 58  table of contents  \u00a0 part ii  item 8  \u00a0  and (iii)\u00a0best estimate of selling price (\u0093esp\u0094). for software elements, we follow the industry specific software guidance which only allows for the use of vsoe in establishing fair value. generally, vsoe is the price charged when the deliverable is sold separately or the price established by management for a product that is not yet sold if it is probable that the price will not change before introduction into the marketplace. esps are established as best estimates of what the selling prices would be if the deliverables were sold regularly on a stand-alone basis. our process for determining esps requires judgment and considers multiple factors that may vary over time depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each deliverable.  revenue for retail packaged products, products licensed to original equipment manufacturers (\u0093oems\u0094), and perpetual licenses under certain volume licensing programs generally is recognized as products are shipped or made available.  technology guarantee programs are accounted for as multiple-element arrangements as customers receive free or significantly discounted rights to use upcoming new versions of a software product if they license existing versions of the product during the eligibility period. revenue is allocated between the existing product and the new product, and revenue allocated to the new product is deferred until that version is delivered. the revenue allocation is based on the vsoe of fair value of the products. the vsoe of fair value for upcoming new products are based on the price determined by management having the relevant authority when the element is not yet sold separately, but is expected to be sold in the near future at the price set by management.  software updates that will be provided free of charge are evaluated on a case-by-case basis to determine whether they meet the definition of an upgrade and create a multiple-element arrangement, which may require revenue to be deferred and recognized when the upgrade is delivered, or if it is determined that implied post-contract customer support (\u0093pcs\u0094) is being provided, the arrangement is accounted for as a multiple-element arrangement and all revenue from the arrangement is deferred and recognized over the implied pcs term when the vsoe of fair value does not exist. if updates are determined to not meet the definition of an upgrade, revenue is generally recognized as products are shipped or made available.  certain volume licensing arrangements include a perpetual license for current products combined with rights to receive unspecified future versions of software products, which we have determined are additional software products and are therefore accounted for as subscriptions, with billings recorded as unearned revenue and recognized as revenue ratably over the coverage period. arrangements that include term-based licenses for current products with the right to use unspecified future versions of the software during the coverage period, are also accounted for as subscriptions, with revenue recognized ratably over the coverage period.  revenue from cloud-based services arrangements that allow for the use of a hosted software product or service over a contractually determined period of time without taking possession of software are accounted for as subscriptions with billings recorded as unearned revenue and recognized as revenue ratably over the coverage period beginning on the date the service is made available to customers. revenue from cloud-based services arrangements that are provided on a consumption basis (for example, the amount of storage used in a particular period) is recognized commensurate with the customer utilization of such resources.  some volume licensing arrangements include time-based subscriptions for cloud-based services and software offerings that are accounted for as subscriptions. these arrangements are considered multiple-element arrangements. however, because all elements are accounted for as subscriptions and have the same coverage period and delivery pattern, they have the same revenue recognition timing.  revenue related to phones, surface devices, xbox consoles, games published by us, and other hardware components is generally recognized when ownership is transferred to the resellers or to end customers when selling directly through microsoft retail stores and online marketplaces. a portion of revenue may be deferred when these products are combined with software elements, and/or services. revenue related to licensing for games published by third parties for use on the xbox consoles is recognized when games are manufactured by the game publishers.  display advertising revenue is recognized as advertisements are displayed. search advertising revenue is recognized when the ad appears in the search results or when the action necessary to earn the revenue has been  \u00a0 59  table of contents  \u00a0 part ii  item 8  \u00a0  completed. consulting services revenue is recognized as services are rendered, generally based on the negotiated hourly rate in the consulting arrangement and the number of hours worked during the period. consulting revenue for fixed-price services arrangements is recognized as services are provided. revenue from prepaid points redeemable for the purchase of software or services is recognized upon redemption of the points and delivery of the software or services.  cost of revenue  cost of revenue includes: manufacturing and distribution costs for products sold and programs licensed; operating costs related to product support service centers and product distribution centers; costs incurred to include software on pcs sold by oems, to drive traffic to our websites, and to acquire online advertising space; costs incurred to support and maintain internet-based products and services, including datacenter costs and royalties; warranty costs; inventory valuation adjustments; costs associated with the delivery of consulting services; and the amortization of capitalized software development costs. capitalized software development costs are amortized over the estimated lives of the products.  product warranty  we provide for the estimated costs of fulfilling our obligations under hardware and software warranties at the time the related revenue is recognized. for hardware warranties, we estimate the costs based on historical and projected product failure rates, historical and projected repair costs, and knowledge of specific product failures (if any). the specific hardware warranty terms and conditions vary depending upon the product sold and the country in which we do business, but generally include parts and labor over a period generally ranging from 90\u00a0days to three years. for software warranties, we estimate the costs to provide bug fixes, such as security patches, over the estimated life of the software. we regularly reevaluate our estimates to assess the adequacy of the recorded warranty liabilities and adjust the amounts as necessary.  research and development  research and development expenses include payroll, employee benefits, stock-based compensation expense, and other headcount-related expenses associated with product development. research and development expenses also include third-party development and programming costs, localization costs incurred to translate software for international markets, and the amortization of purchased software code and services content. such costs related to software development are included in research and development expense until the point that technological feasibility is reached, which for our software products, is generally shortly before the products are released to manufacturing. once technological feasibility is reached, such costs are capitalized and amortized to cost of revenue over the estimated lives of the products.  sales and marketing  sales and marketing expenses include payroll, employee benefits, stock-based compensation expense, and other headcount-related expenses associated with sales and marketing personnel, and the costs of advertising, promotions, trade shows, seminars, and other programs. advertising costs are expensed as incurred. advertising expense was $1.9 billion, $2.3 billion, and $2.6 billion in fiscal years 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively.  stock-based compensation  we measure stock-based compensation cost at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and recognize it as expense, net of estimated forfeitures, over the vesting or service period, as applicable, of the stock award (generally four to five years) using the straight-line method.  \u00a0 60  table of contents  \u00a0 part ii  item 8  \u00a0 employee stock purchase plan  shares of our common stock may be purchased by employees at three-month intervals at 90% of the fair market value of the stock on the last day of each three-month period. compensation expense for the employee stock purchase plan is measured as the discount the employee is entitled to upon purchase and is recognized in the period of purchase.  income taxes  income tax expense includes u.s. and international income taxes, the provision for u.s. taxes on undistributed earnings of international subsidiaries not deemed to be permanently invested, and interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions. certain income and expenses are not reported in tax returns and financial statements in the same year. the tax effect of such temporary differences is reported as deferred income taxes. deferred tax assets are reported net of a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized. the deferred income taxes are classified as current or long-term based on the classification of the related asset or liability.  fair value measurements  we account for certain assets and liabilities at fair value. the hierarchy below lists three levels of fair value based on the extent to which inputs used in measuring fair value are observable in the market.\u00a0we categorize each of our fair value measurements in one of these three levels based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. these levels are:  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 we measure certain assets, including our cost and equity method investments, at fair value on a nonrecurring basis when they are deemed to be other-than-temporarily impaired. the fair values of these investments are determined based on valuation techniques using the best information available, and may include quoted market prices, market comparables, and discounted cash flow projections. an impairment charge is recorded when the cost of the investment exceeds its fair value and this condition is determined to be other-than-temporary.  our other current financial assets and our current financial liabilities have fair values that approximate their carrying values.  \u00a0 61  table of contents  \u00a0 part ii  item 8  \u00a0 financial instruments  we consider all highly liquid interest-earning investments with a maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase to be cash equivalents. the fair values of these investments approximate their carrying values. in general, investments with original maturities of greater than three months and remaining maturities of less than one year are classified as short-term investments. investments with maturities beyond one year may be classified as short-term based on their highly liquid nature and because such marketable securities represent the investment of cash that is available for current operations. all cash equivalents and short-term investments are classified as available-for-sale and realized gains and losses are recorded using the specific identification method. changes in market value, excluding other-than-temporary impairments, are reflected in oci.  equity and other investments classified as long-term include both debt and equity instruments. with the exception of certain corporate notes that are classified as held-to-maturity, debt and publicly-traded equity securities are classified as available-for-sale and realized gains and losses are recorded using the specific identification method. changes in the market value of available-for-sale securities, excluding other-than-temporary impairments, are reflected in oci. held-to-maturity investments are recorded and held at amortized cost. common and preferred stock and other investments that are restricted for more than one year or are not publicly traded are recorded at cost or using the equity method.  we lend certain fixed-income and equity securities to increase investment returns. the loaned securities continue to be carried as investments on our balance sheet. cash and/or security interests are received as collateral for the loaned securities with the amount determined based upon the underlying security lent and the creditworthiness of the borrower. cash received is recorded as an asset with a corresponding liability.  investments are considered to be impaired when a decline in fair value is judged to be other-than-temporary. fair value is calculated based on publicly available market information or other estimates determined by management. we employ a systematic methodology on a quarterly basis that considers available quantitative and qualitative evidence in evaluating potential impairment of our investments. if the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value, we evaluate, among other factors, general market conditions, credit quality of debt instrument issuers, the duration and extent to which the fair value is less than cost, and for equity securities, our intent and ability to hold, or plans to sell, the investment. for fixed-income securities, we also evaluate whether we have plans to sell the security or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery. we also consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of and business outlook for the investee, including industry and sector performance, changes in technology, and operational and financing cash flow factors. once a decline in fair value is determined to be other-than-temporary, an impairment charge is recorded to other income (expense), net and a new cost basis in the investment is established.  derivative instruments are recognized as either assets or liabilities and are measured at fair value. the accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation.  for derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges, the gains (losses) are recognized in earnings in the periods of change together with the offsetting losses (gains) on the hedged items attributed to the risk being hedged. for options designated as fair value hedges, changes in the time value are excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and are recognized in earnings.  for derivative instruments designated as cash-flow hedges, the effective portion of the gains (losses) on the derivatives is initially reported as a component of oci and is subsequently recognized in earnings when the hedged exposure is recognized in earnings. for options designated as cash-flow hedges, changes in the time value are excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and are recognized in earnings. gains (losses) on derivatives representing either hedge components excluded from the assessment of effectiveness or hedge ineffectiveness are recognized in earnings.  for derivative instruments that are not designated as hedges, gains (losses) from changes in fair values are primarily recognized in other income (expense), net. other than those derivatives entered into for investment  \u00a0 62  table of contents  \u00a0 part ii  item 8  \u00a0  purposes, such as commodity contracts, the gains (losses) are generally economically offset by unrealized gains (losses) in the underlying available-for-sale securities, which are recorded as a component of oci until the securities are sold or other-than-temporarily impaired, at which time the amounts are reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income (\u0093aoci\u0094) into other income (expense), net.  allowance for doubtful accounts  the allowance for doubtful accounts reflects our best estimate of probable losses inherent in the accounts receivable balance. we determine the allowance based on known troubled accounts, historical experience, and other currently available evidence. activity in the allowance for doubtful accounts was as follows:  \u00a0 inventories  inventories are stated at average cost, subject to the lower of cost or market. cost includes materials, labor, and manufacturing overhead related to the purchase and production of inventories. we regularly review inventory quantities on hand, future purchase commitments with our suppliers, and the estimated utility of our inventory. if our review indicates a reduction in utility below carrying value, we reduce our inventory to a new cost basis through a charge to cost of revenue. the determination of market value and the estimated volume of demand used in the lower of cost or market analysis require significant judgment.  property and equipment  property and equipment is stated at cost and depreciated using the straight-line method over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the asset or the lease term. the estimated useful lives of our property and equipment are generally as follows: computer software developed or acquired for internal use, three to seven years; computer equipment, two to three years; buildings and improvements, five to 15 years; leasehold improvements, three to 20 years; and furniture and equipment, one to 10 years. land is not depreciated.  goodwill  goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level (operating segment or one level below an operating segment) on an annual basis (may 1 for us) and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value.  intangible assets  all of our intangible assets are subject to amortization and are amortized using the straight-line method over their estimated period of benefit, ranging from one to 15 years. we evaluate the recoverability of intangible assets periodically by taking into account events or circumstances that may warrant revised estimates of useful lives or that indicate the asset may be impaired.  \u00a0 63  table of contents  \u00a0 part ii  item 8  \u00a0 recent accounting guidance not yet adopted  in may 2014, as part of its ongoing efforts to assist in the convergence of u.s. gaap and international financial reporting standards, the financial accounting standards board (\u0093fasb\u0094) issued a new standard related to revenue recognition. under the new standard, recognition of revenue occurs when a customer obtains control of promised goods or services in an amount that reflects the consideration which the entity expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. in addition, the standard requires disclosure of the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. the new standard will be effective for us beginning july\u00a01, 2018, and adoption as of the original effective date of july\u00a01, 2017 is permitted. we anticipate this standard will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements, and we are currently evaluating its impact.  note 2 - earnings per share  basic earnings per share (\u0093eps\u0094) is computed based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. diluted eps is computed based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock plus the effect of dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period using the treasury stock method. dilutive potential common shares include outstanding stock options and stock awards.  the components of basic and diluted eps were as follows:  \u00a0 anti-dilutive stock-based awards excluded from the calculations of diluted eps were immaterial during the periods presented.  note 3 - other income (expense), net  the components of other income (expense), net were as follows:  \u00a0 \u00a0 64  table of contents  \u00a0 part ii  item 8  \u00a0 following are details of net recognized gains on investments during the periods reported:  \u00a0 note 4 - investments  investment components  the components of investments, including associated derivatives, but excluding held-to-maturity investments, were as follows:  \u00a0 \u00a0 65  table of contents  \u00a0 part ii  item 8  \u00a0 in addition to the investments in the table above, we also own corporate notes that are classified as held-to-maturity investments, which are included in equity and other investments on the balance sheet.\u00a0these corporate notes are due october\u00a031, 2023 and are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. as of june\u00a030, 2015, the amortized cost and recorded basis of these corporate notes were both $25 million with an estimated fair value that approximates the carrying value. as of june\u00a030, 2014, the amortized cost, recorded basis, and estimated fair value of these corporate notes was $1.5 billion, $1.5 billion, and $1.7 billion, respectively, while their associated gross unrealized holding gains were $164 million.  as of june\u00a030, 2015 and 2014, the recorded bases of common and preferred stock that are restricted for more than one year or are not publicly traded were $561 million and $520 million, respectively. these investments are carried at cost and are reviewed quarterly for indicators of other-than-temporary impairment. it is not practicable for us to reliably estimate the fair value of these investments.  we lend certain fixed-income and equity securities to increase investment returns. these transactions are accounted for as secured borrowings and the loaned securities continue to be carried as investments on our balance sheet. cash and/or security interests are received as collateral for the loaned securities with the amount determined based upon the underlying security lent and the creditworthiness of the borrower. as of june 30, 2015, collateral received under these agreements totaled $92 million which is comprised of $79 million of certificates of deposit and $13 million of u.s. government and agency securities. the contractual maturities of these agreements are primarily on a continuous and overnight basis.  \u00a0 66  table of contents  \u00a0 part ii  item 8  \u00a0 unrealized losses on investments  investments with continuous unrealized losses for less than 12 months and 12 months or greater and their related fair values were as follows:  \u00a0 \u00a0 unrealized losses from fixed-income securities are primarily attributable to changes in interest rates. unrealized losses from domestic and international equities are due to market price movements. management does not believe any remaining unrealized losses represent other-than-temporary impairments based on our evaluation of available evidence as of june\u00a030, 2015.  debt investment maturities  \u00a0 note 5 - derivatives  we use derivative instruments to manage risks related to foreign currencies, equity prices, interest rates, and credit; to enhance investment returns; and to facilitate portfolio diversification. our objectives for holding derivatives include reducing, eliminating, and efficiently managing the economic impact of these exposures as effectively as possible.  our derivative programs include strategies that both qualify and do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment. all notional amounts presented below are measured in u.s. dollar equivalents.  \u00a0 67  table of contents  \u00a0 part ii  item 8  \u00a0 foreign currency  certain forecasted transactions, assets, and liabilities are exposed to foreign currency risk. we monitor our foreign currency exposures daily to maximize the economic effectiveness of our foreign currency hedge positions. option and forward contracts are used to hedge a portion of forecasted international revenue for up to three years in the future and are designated as cash flow hedging instruments. principal currencies hedged include the euro, japanese yen, british pound, canadian dollar, and australian dollar. as of june\u00a030, 2015 and june\u00a030, 2014, the total notional amounts of these foreign exchange contracts sold were $9.8 billion and $4.9 billion, respectively.  foreign currency risks related to certain non-u.s. dollar denominated securities are hedged using foreign exchange forward contracts that are designated as fair value hedging instruments. as of june\u00a030, 2015 and june\u00a030, 2014, the total notional amounts of these foreign exchange contracts sold were $5.3 billion and $3.1 billion, respectively.  certain options and forwards not designated as hedging instruments are also used to manage the variability in foreign exchange rates on certain balance sheet amounts and to manage other foreign currency exposures.\u00a0as of june\u00a030, 2015, the total notional amounts of these foreign exchange contracts purchased and sold were $9.7 billion and $11.0 billion, respectively. as of june\u00a030, 2014, the total notional amounts of these foreign exchange contracts purchased and sold were $6.2 billion and $8.5 billion, respectively.  equity  securities held in our equity and other investments portfolio are subject to market price risk.\u00a0market price risk is managed relative to broad-based global and domestic equity indices using certain convertible preferred investments, options, futures, and swap contracts not designated as hedging instruments. from time to time, to hedge our price risk, we may use and designate equity derivatives as hedging instruments, including puts, calls, swaps, and forwards.\u00a0as of june\u00a030, 2015, the total notional amounts of equity contracts purchased and sold for managing market price risk were $2.2 billion and $2.6 billion, respectively, of which $1.1 billion and $1.4 billion, respectively, were designated as hedging instruments. as of june\u00a030, 2014, the total notional amounts of equity contracts purchased and sold for managing market price risk were $1.9 billion and $1.9 billion, respectively, of which $362 million and $420 million, respectively, were designated as hedging instruments.  interest rate  securities held in our fixed-income portfolio are subject to different interest rate risks based on their maturities. we manage the average maturity of our fixed-income portfolio to achieve economic returns that correlate to certain broad-based fixed-income indices using exchange-traded option and futures contracts and over-the-counter swap and option contracts, none of which are designated as hedging instruments. as of june\u00a030, 2015, the total notional amounts of fixed-interest rate contracts purchased and sold were $1.0 billion and $3.2 billion, respectively. as of june\u00a030, 2014, the total notional amounts of fixed-interest rate contracts purchased and sold were $1.7 billion and $936 million, respectively.  in addition, we use \u0093to be announced\u0094 forward purchase commitments of mortgage-backed assets to gain exposure to agency mortgage-backed securities.\u00a0these meet the definition of a derivative instrument in cases where physical delivery of the assets is not taken at the earliest available delivery date. as of june\u00a030, 2015 and 2014, the total notional derivative amounts of mortgage contracts purchased were $812 million and $1.1 billion, respectively.  credit  our fixed-income portfolio is diversified and consists primarily of investment-grade securities. we use credit default swap contracts, not designated as hedging instruments, to manage credit exposures relative to broad-based indices and to facilitate portfolio diversification. we use credit default swaps as they are a low-cost method of managing exposure to individual credit risks or groups of credit risks. as of june\u00a030, 2015, the total notional amounts of credit contracts purchased and sold were $618 million and $430 million, respectively. as of june\u00a030, 2014, the total notional amounts of credit contracts purchased and sold were $550 million and $440 million, respectively.  \u00a0 68  table of contents  \u00a0 part ii  item 8  \u00a0 commodity  we use broad-based commodity exposures to enhance portfolio returns and to facilitate portfolio diversification. we use swaps, futures, and option contracts, not designated as hedging instruments, to generate and manage exposures to broad-based commodity indices. we use derivatives on commodities as they can be low-cost alternatives to the purchase and storage of a variety of commodities, including, but not limited to, precious metals, energy, and grain. as of june\u00a030, 2015, the total notional amounts of commodity contracts purchased and sold were $882 million and $316 million, respectively. as of june\u00a030, 2014, the total notional amounts of commodity contracts purchased and sold were $1.4 billion and $408 million, respectively.  credit-risk-related contingent features  certain of our counterparty agreements for derivative instruments contain provisions that require our issued and outstanding long-term unsecured debt to maintain an investment grade credit rating and require us to maintain minimum liquidity of $1.0 billion. to the extent we fail to meet these requirements, we will be required to post collateral, similar to the standard convention related to over-the-counter derivatives. as of june\u00a030, 2015, our long-term unsecured debt rating was aaa, and cash investments were in excess of $1.0 billion. as a result, no collateral was required to be posted.  \u00a0 69  table of contents  \u00a0 part ii  item 8  \u00a0 fair values of derivative instruments  the following table presents the fair values of derivative instruments designated as hedging instruments (\u0093designated hedge derivatives\u0094) and not designated as hedging instruments (\u0093non-designated hedge derivatives\u0094). the fair values exclude the impact of netting derivative assets and liabilities when a legally enforceable master netting agreement exists and fair value adjustments related to our own credit risk and counterparty credit risk:  \u00a0 see also note 4 \u0096 investments and note\u00a06\u00a0\u0096 fair value measurements.  \u00a0 70  table of contents  \u00a0 part ii  item 8  \u00a0 fair value hedge gains (losses)  we recognized in other income (expense), net the following gains (losses) on contracts designated as fair value hedges and their related hedged items:  \u00a0 cash flow hedge gains (losses)  we recognized the following gains (losses) on foreign exchange contracts designated as cash flow hedges (our only cash flow hedges during the periods presented):  \u00a0 we estimate that $492 million of net derivative gains included in aoci at june\u00a030, 2015 will be reclassified into earnings within the following 12 months. no significant amounts of gains (losses) were reclassified from aoci into earnings as a result of forecasted transactions that failed to occur during fiscal year 2015.  non-designated derivative gains (losses)  gains (losses) from changes in fair values of derivatives that are not designated as hedges are primarily recognized in other income (expense), net. these amounts are shown in the table below, with the exception of gains (losses) on derivatives presented in income statement line items other than other income (expense), net, which were immaterial for the periods presented. other than those derivatives entered into for investment purposes, such as commodity contracts, the gains (losses) below are generally economically offset by unrealized gains (losses) in the underlying available-for-sale securities and gains (losses) from foreign exchange rate changes on certain balance sheet amounts.  \u00a0 \u00a0 71  table of contents  \u00a0 part ii  item 8  \u00a0 note 6 - fair value measurements  assets and liabilities measured

measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis.  note 7 - inventories  the components of inventories were as follows:  \u00a0 note 8 - property and equipment  the components of property and equipment were as follows:  \u00a0 during fiscal years 2015, 2014, and 2013, depreciation expense was $4.1 billion, $3.4 billion, and $2.6 billion, respectively.  \u00a0 73  table of contents  \u00a0 part ii  item 8  \u00a0 note 9 - business combinations  mojang synergies ab  on november\u00a06, 2014, we acquired mojang synergies ab (\u0093mojang\u0094), the swedish video game developer of the minecraft gaming franchise, for $2.5 billion in cash, net of cash acquired. the addition of minecraft and its community enhances our gaming portfolio across windows, xbox, and other ecosystems besides our own. our purchase price allocation is preliminary and subject to revision as more detailed analyses are completed and additional information about fair value of assets and liabilities becomes available, including additional information relating to tax matters and finalization of our valuation of identified intangible assets.  the significant classes of assets and liabilities to which we preliminarily allocated the purchase price were goodwill of $1.8 billion and identifiable intangible assets of $928 million, primarily marketing-related (trade names). the goodwill recognized in connection with the acquisition is primarily attributable to anticipated synergies from future growth, and is not expected to be deductible for tax purposes. we assigned the goodwill to our devices and consumer (\u0093d&c\u0094) other segment. identifiable intangible assets were assigned a total weighted-average amortization period of 6.3 years. mojang has been included in our consolidated results of operations since the acquisition date.  nokia\u0092s devices and services business  on april\u00a025, 2014, we acquired substantially all of nokia corporation\u0092s (\u0093nokia\u0094) devices and services business (\u0093nds\u0094) for a total purchase price of $9.4 billion, including cash acquired of $1.5 billion (the \u0093acquisition\u0094). the purchase price consisted primarily of cash of $7.1 billion and nokia\u0092s repurchase of convertible notes of $2.1 billion, which was a non-cash transaction, and liabilities assumed of $0.2 billion. the acquisition was expected to accelerate the growth of our d&c business through faster innovation, synergies, and unified branding and marketing.  the allocation of the purchase price to goodwill was completed as of march\u00a031, 2015. the major classes of assets and liabilities to which we have allocated the purchase price were as follows:  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 74  table of contents  \u00a0 part ii  item 8  \u00a0 following are the details of the purchase price allocated to the intangible assets acquired:  \u00a0 during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2015, we recorded $7.5 billion of goodwill and asset impairment charges related to our phone hardware business. these costs are included in impairment, integration, and restructuring expenses in our consolidated income statement. see note 10 \u0096 goodwill and note 11 \u0096 intangible assets for additional details.  our consolidated income statement for fiscal year 2014 included revenue and operating loss of $2.0 billion and $692 million, respectively, attributable to nds since the acquisition.  following are the supplemental consolidated results of microsoft corporation on an unaudited pro forma basis, as if the acquisition had been consummated on july\u00a01, 2012:  \u00a0 these pro forma results were based on estimates and assumptions, which we believe are reasonable. they are not the results that would have been realized had we been a combined company during the periods presented and are not necessarily indicative of our consolidated results of operations in future periods. the pro forma results include adjustments primarily related to purchase accounting adjustments and the elimination of related party transactions between microsoft and nds. acquisition costs and other nonrecurring charges incurred are included in the earliest period presented.  during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2014, we incurred $21 million of acquisition costs associated with the purchase of nds. acquisition costs are primarily comprised of transaction fees and direct acquisition costs, including legal, finance, consulting, and other professional fees. these costs are included in impairment, integration, and restructuring expenses on our consolidated income statement for fiscal year 2014.  certain concurrent transactions were recognized separately from the acquisition. prior to the acquisition, we had joint strategic initiatives with nokia; this contractual relationship was terminated in conjunction with the acquisition. no gain or loss was recorded upon termination of this agreement, as it was determined to be at market value. in addition, we agreed to license nokia\u0092s mapping services and will pay nokia separately for the services provided under a four-year license as they are rendered.  yammer  on july\u00a018, 2012, we acquired yammer, inc. (\u0093yammer\u0094), a leading provider of enterprise social networks, for $1.1 billion in cash. yammer added an enterprise social networking service to microsoft\u0092s portfolio of complementary cloud-based services. the major classes of assets to which we allocated the purchase price were goodwill of $937 million and identifiable intangible assets of $178 million. we assigned the goodwill to commercial other under our current segment structure. yammer was consolidated into our results of operations starting on the acquisition date.  \u00a0 75  table of contents  \u00a0 part ii  item 8  \u00a0 other  during fiscal year 2015, we completed 15 additional acquisitions for total cash consideration of $892 million. these entities have been included in our consolidated results of operations since their respective acquisition dates.  pro forma results of operations for mojang and our other acquisitions during the current period have not been presented because the effects of these business combinations, individually and in aggregate, were not material to our consolidated results of operations.  note 10 - goodwill  changes in the carrying amount of goodwill were as follows:  \u00a0 \u00a0 the measurement periods for the valuation of assets acquired and liabilities assumed end as soon as information on the facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition dates becomes available, but do not exceed 12 months. adjustments in purchase price allocations may require a recasting of the amounts allocated to goodwill retroactive to the periods in which the acquisitions occurred.  any change in the goodwill amounts resulting from foreign currency translations and purchase accounting adjustments are presented as \u0093other\u0094 in the above table. also included in \u0093other\u0094 are business dispositions and transfers between business segments due to reorganizations, as applicable. for fiscal year 2015, a $5.1 billion goodwill impairment charge was included in \u0093other,\u0094 as discussed further below. this goodwill impairment charge was included in impairment, integration, and restructuring expenses in our consolidated income statement, and reflected in corporate and other in our table of operating income (loss) by segment group in note 22 \u0096 segment information and geographic data.  our accumulated goodwill impairment as of june\u00a030, 2015 and 2014 was $11.3 billion and $6.2 billion, respectively.  \u00a0 76  table of contents  \u00a0 part ii  item 8  \u00a0 goodwill impairment  we test goodwill for impairment annually on may\u00a01 at the reporting unit level, primarily using a discounted cash flow methodology with a peer-based, risk-adjusted weighted average cost of capital. we believe use of a discounted cash flow approach is the most reliable indicator of the fair values of the businesses.  upon completion of the annual testing as of may\u00a01, 2015, phone hardware goodwill was determined to be impaired. in the second half of fiscal year 2015, phone hardware did not meet its sales volume and revenue goals, and the mix of units sold had lower margins than planned. these results, along with changes in the competitive marketplace and an evaluation of business priorities, led to a shift in strategic direction and reduced future revenue and profitability expectations for the business. as a result of these changes in strategy and expectations, we have forecasted reductions in unit volume growth rates and lower future cash flows used to estimate the fair value of the phone hardware reporting unit, which resulted in the determination that an impairment adjustment was required.  because our annual test indicated that phone hardware\u0092s carrying value exceeded its estimated fair value, a second phase of the goodwill impairment test (\u0093step 2\u0094) was performed specific to phone hardware. under step 2, the fair value of all phone hardware assets and liabilities were estimated, including tangible assets, existing technology, patent agreements, and contractual arrangements, for the purpose of deriving an estimate of the implied fair value of goodwill. the implied fair value of the goodwill was then compared to the recorded goodwill to determine the amount of the impairment. assumptions used in measuring the value of these assets and liabilities included the discount rates and royalty rates used in valuing the intangible assets, and consideration of the market environment in valuing the tangible assets.  no other instances of impairment were identified in our may\u00a01, 2015 test. no impairment of goodwill was identified as of may\u00a01, 2014.  note 11 - intangible assets  the components of intangible assets, all of which are finite-lived, were as follows:  \u00a0 \u00a0 we estimate that we have no significant residual value related to our intangible assets. during fiscal year 2015, we recorded impairment charges of $2.2 billion related to our phone hardware intangible assets. in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2015, we tested the intangible assets for recoverability due to changes in facts and circumstances associated with the shift in strategic direction and reduced profitability expectations for phone hardware. based on the results of our testing, we determined that the carrying value of the intangible assets was not recoverable, and an impairment charge was recorded to the extent that estimated fair value exceeded carrying value. we primarily used a relief from royalty income approach to determine the fair value of the intangible assets and determine the amount of impairment. these intangible assets impairment charges were included in impairment, integration, and restructuring expenses in our consolidated income statement, and reflected in corporate and other in our table of operating income (loss) by segment group in note 22 \u0096 segment information and geographic data. no material impairments of intangible assets were identified during fiscal year 2014.  \u00a0 77  table of contents  \u00a0 part ii  item 8  \u00a0 the components of intangible assets acquired during the periods presented were as follows:  \u00a0 the table above includes $4.5 billion related to the acquisition of nds during fiscal year 2014, of which $2.2 billion was impaired in fiscal year 2015. see note 9 \u0096 business combination for additional details.  intangible assets amortization expense was $1.3 billion, $845 million, and $739 million for fiscal years 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively. amortization of capitalized software was $79 million, $200 million, and $210 million for fiscal years 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively.  the following table outlines the estimated future amortization expense related to intangible assets held at june\u00a030, 2015:  \u00a0 note 12 - debt  short-term debt  as of june\u00a030, 2015, we had $5.0 billion of commercial paper issued and outstanding, with a weighted-average interest rate of 0.11% and maturities ranging from 8 days to 63 days. as of june\u00a030, 2014, we had $2.0 billion of commercial paper issued and outstanding, with a weighted-average interest rate of 0.12% and maturities ranging from 86 to 91 days. the estimated fair value of this commercial paper approximates its carrying value.  we have two $5.0 billion credit facilities that expire on november\u00a04, 2015 and november\u00a014, 2018, respectively. these credit facilities serve as a back-up for our commercial paper program. as of june\u00a030, 2015, we were in compliance with the only financial covenant in both credit agreements, which requires us to maintain a coverage ratio of at least three times earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization to interest expense, as defined in the credit agreements. no amounts were drawn against these credit facilities during any of the periods presented.  long-term debt  as of june\u00a030, 2015, the total carrying value and estimated fair value of our long-term debt, including the current portion, were $30.3 billion and $30.5 billion, respectively. this is compared to a carrying value and estimated fair value of our long-term debt of $20.6 billion and $21.5 billion, respectively, as of june\u00a030, 2014. these estimated fair values are based on level 2 inputs.  \u00a0 78  table of contents  \u00a0 part ii  item 8  \u00a0 the components of our long-term debt, including the current portion, and the associated interest rates were as follows as of june\u00a030, 2015 and 2014:  \u00a0 \u00a0 the notes in the table above are senior unsecured obligations and rank equally with our other senior unsecured debt outstanding. interest on these notes is paid semi-annually, except for the euro-denominated debt securities on which interest is paid annually. cash paid for interest on our debt for fiscal years 2015, 2014, and 2013 was $620 million, $509 million, and $371 million, respectively. as of june\u00a030, 2015 and 2014, the aggregate unamortized discount for our long-term debt, including the current portion, was $156 million and $100 million, respectively.  \u00a0 79  table of contents  \u00a0 part ii  item 8  \u00a0 debt service  maturities of our long-term debt for each of the next five years and thereafter are as follows:  \u00a0 note 13 - income taxes  the components of the provision for income taxes were as follows:  \u00a0 u.s. and foreign components of income before income taxes were as follows:  \u00a0 the items accounting for the difference between income taxes computed at the u.s. federal statutory rate and our effective rate were as follows:  \u00a0 \u00a0 80  table of contents  \u00a0 part ii  item 8  \u00a0 the reduction from the federal statutory rate is primarily due to foreign earnings taxed at lower rates resulting from producing and distributing our products and services through our foreign regional operations centers in ireland, singapore, and puerto rico. in fiscal year 2015, this reduction was mostly offset by losses in foreign jurisdictions for which we may not realize a tax benefit, primarily as a result of impairment and restructuring charges. excluding these losses, our foreign earnings, which are taxed at rates lower than the u.s. rate and are generated from our regional operating centers, were 73%, 81%, and 79% of our foreign income before tax in fiscal years 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively. in general, other reconciling items consist of interest, u.s. state income taxes, and credits. in fiscal years 2015, 2014, and 2013, there were no individually significant other reconciling items.  the components of the deferred income tax assets and liabilities were as follows:  \u00a0 as of june\u00a030, 2015, we had net operating loss carryforwards of $4.6 billion, including $1.8 billion of foreign net operating loss carryforwards acquired through our acquisition of skype, and $545 million through our acquisition of nds. the valuation allowance disclosed in the table above relates to the foreign net operating loss carryforwards and other future deductible net deferred tax assets that may not be realized.  deferred income tax balances reflect the effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases and are stated at enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when the taxes are actually paid or recovered.  as of june\u00a030, 2015, we have not provided deferred u.s. income taxes or foreign withholding taxes on temporary differences of approximately $108.3 billion resulting from earnings for certain non-u.s. subsidiaries which are  \u00a0 81  table of contents  \u00a0 part ii  item 8  \u00a0  permanently reinvested outside the u.s. the unrecognized deferred tax liability associated with these temporary differences was approximately $34.5 billion at june\u00a030, 2015.  income taxes paid were $4.4 billion, $5.5 billion, and $3.9 billion in fiscal years 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively.  uncertain tax positions  unrecognized tax benefits as of june\u00a030, 2015, 2014, and 2013, were $9.6 billion, $8.7 billion, and $8.6 billion, respectively. if recognized, these tax benefits would affect our effective tax rates for fiscal years 2015, 2014, and 2013, by $7.9 billion, $7.0 billion, and $6.5 billion, respectively.  as of june\u00a030, 2015, 2014, and 2013, we had accrued interest expense related to uncertain tax positions of $1.7 billion, $1.5 billion, and $1.3 billion, respectively, net of federal income tax benefits. interest expense on unrecognized tax benefits was $237 million, $235 million, and $400 million in fiscal years 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively, and was included in income tax expense.  the aggregate changes in the balance of unrecognized tax benefits were as follows:  \u00a0 during the third quarter of fiscal year 2011, we reached a settlement of a portion of an i.r.s. audit of tax years 2004 to 2006, which reduced our income tax expense by $461 million. while we settled a portion of the i.r.s. audit, we remain under audit for these years. in february 2012, the i.r.s. withdrew its 2011 revenue agents report and reopened the audit phase of the examination. as of june\u00a030, 2015, the primary unresolved issue relates to transfer pricing, which could have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements if not resolved favorably. we believe our allowances for income tax contingencies are adequate. we have not received a proposed assessment for the unresolved issues and do not expect a final resolution of these issues in the next 12 months.\u00a0based on the information currently available, we do not anticipate a significant increase or decrease to our tax contingencies for these issues within the next 12 months. we also continue to be subject to examination by the i.r.s. for tax years 2007 to 2015.  we are subject to income tax in many jurisdictions outside the u.s. our operations in certain jurisdictions remain subject to examination for tax years 1996 to 2015, some of which are currently under audit by local tax authorities. the resolutions of these audits are not expected to be material to our consolidated financial statements.  note 14 - restructuring charges  phone hardware integration  in july 2014, we announced a restructuring plan to simplify our organization and align nds with our company\u0092s overall strategy (the \u0093phone hardware integration plan\u0094). pursuant to the phone hardware integration plan, we eliminated approximately 19,000 positions in fiscal year 2015, including approximately 13,000 professional and factory positions related to the nds business. the actions associated with the phone hardware integration plan were completed as of june\u00a030, 2015.  \u00a0 82  table of contents  \u00a0 part ii  item 8  \u00a0 in connection with the phone hardware integration plan, we incurred restructuring charges of $1.3 billion during fiscal year 2015, including severance expenses and other reorganization costs, primarily associated with our facilities consolidation and write-downs of certain assets.  phone hardware restructuring  in june 2015, management approved a plan to restructure our phone hardware business to better focus and align resources (the \u0093phone hardware restructuring plan\u0094), under which we will eliminate up to 7,800 positions in fiscal year 2016. in connection with the phone hardware restructuring plan, we recorded restructuring charges of $780 million during fiscal year 2015, including severance expenses and other reorganization costs, primarily related to contractual obligations. the actions associated with the phone hardware restructuring plan are expected to be completed as of june\u00a030, 2016.  restructuring charges associated with each plan were included in impairment, integration, and restructuring expenses in our consolidated income statement, and reflected in corporate and other in our table of operating income (loss) by segment group in note 22 - segment information and geographic data.  changes in the restructuring liability were as follows:  \u00a0 \u00a0 note 15 - unearned revenue  unearned revenue by segment was as follows, with segments with significant balances shown separately:  \u00a0 note 16 - other long-term liabilities  \u00a0 \u00a0 83  table of contents  \u00a0 part ii  item 8  \u00a0 note 17 - commitments and guarantees  construction and operating leases  we have committed $681 million for constructing new buildings, building improvements, and leasehold improvements as of june\u00a030, 2015.  we have operating leases for most u.s. and international sales and support offices, research and development facilities, manufacturing facilities, retail stores, and certain equipment. rental expense for facilities operating leases was $989 million, $874 million, and $711 million, in fiscal years 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively. future minimum rental commitments under non-cancellable facilities operating leases in place as of june\u00a030, 2015 are as follows:  \u00a0 indemnifications  we provide indemnifications of varying scope and size to certain customers against claims of intellectual property infringement made by third parties arising from the use of our products and certain other matters. we evaluate estimated losses for these indemnifications, and we consider such factors as the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss. to date, we have not encountered significant costs as a result of these obligations and have not accrued any liabilities related to these indemnifications in our consolidated financial statements.  note 18 - contingencies  patent and intellectual property claims  motorola litigation  in october 2010, microsoft filed patent infringement complaints against motorola mobility (\u0093motorola\u0094) with the international trade commission (\u0093itc\u0094) and in u.s. district court in seattle for infringement of nine microsoft patents by motorola\u0092s android devices. microsoft and motorola have filed additional claims against each other with the itc, in federal district courts in seattle, wisconsin, florida, and california, and in courts in germany. the nature of the claims asserted and status of individual matters are summarized below.  international trade commission  in 2012, the itc issued a limited exclusion order against motorola on one microsoft patent, which was affirmed on appeal. in 2013, microsoft filed an action in u.s. district court in washington, d.c. seeking an order to compel enforcement of the itc\u0092s 2012 import ban against infringing motorola products by the bureau of customs and border protection (\u0093cbp\u0094), after learning that cbp had failed to fully enforce the order.  in 2010, motorola filed an action against microsoft with the itc alleging infringement of five motorola patents by xbox consoles and accessories and seeking an exclusion order to prohibit importation of the allegedly infringing  \u00a0 84  table of contents  \u00a0 part ii  item 8  \u00a0  xbox products. at motorola\u0092s request, the itc terminated its investigation of four motorola patents. in 2013, the itc affirmed there was no violation of the remaining motorola patent. motorola appealed the itc\u0092s decision to the u.s. court of appeals for the federal circuit.  u.s. district court  the seattle district court case filed in october 2010 by microsoft as a companion to microsoft\u0092s itc case against motorola was stayed pending the outcome of the itc case.  in november 2010, microsoft sued motorola for breach of contract in u.s. district court in seattle, alleging that motorola breached its commitments to standards-setting organizations to license to microsoft certain patents on reasonable and non-discriminatory (\u0093rand\u0094) terms and conditions. motorola has declared these patents essential to the implementation of the h.264 video standard and the 802.11 wi-fi standard. in the motorola itc case described above and in suits described below, motorola or a motorola affiliate subsequently sued microsoft on those patents in u.s. district courts, in the itc, and in germany. in 2012, the seattle district court granted a partial summary judgment in favor of microsoft ruling that (1)\u00a0motorola had committed to standards organizations to license its declared-essential patents on rand terms and conditions; and (2)\u00a0microsoft is a third-party beneficiary of those commitments. after trial, the seattle district court set per unit royalties for motorola\u0092s h.264 and 802.11 patents, which resulted in an immaterial microsoft liability. in 2013, following trial of microsoft\u0092s breach of contract claim, a jury awarded $14.5 million in damages to microsoft. motorola appealed with respect to both the court\u0092s determination of royalties due motorola and the jury\u0092s award of damages against motorola; in july 2015 the u.s. court of appeals for the ninth circuit affirmed the trial court\u0092s judgment in all respects.  cases filed by motorola in wisconsin, california, and florida, with the exception of one case in wisconsin initially stayed and later dismissed without prejudice (a companion case to motorola\u0092s itc action), have been transferred to the u.s district court in seattle. motorola and microsoft both seek damages as well as injunctive relief. the court has stayed these cases in seattle on agreement of the parties.  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 germany  in 2011, motorola filed patent infringement actions in germany against microsoft and several microsoft subsidiaries.  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 85  table of contents  \u00a0 part ii  item 8  \u00a0 in lawsuits microsoft filed in germany in 2011 and 2012, microsoft asserts that motorola android devices infringe microsoft patents and is seeking damages and injunctions. in 2012, regional courts in germany issued injunctions on three of the microsoft patents, which motorola appealed. one judgment has been affirmed on appeal (and motorola has further appealed), and the other two appeals are pending (in one of these two cases the asserted patent has expired). an additional infringement proceeding is still pending in the court of first instance. in actions filed separately by motorola to invalidate these patents, the federal patent court in 2013 and 2014 held the microsoft patents invalid, and microsoft appealed. for the cases in which microsoft obtained injunctions, if motorola were to prevail following all appeals, motorola could have a claim against microsoft for damages caused by an erroneously granted injunction.  ipcom patent litigation  ipcom gmbh\u00a0& co. (\u0093ipcom\u0094) is a german company that holds a large portfolio of mobile technology-related patents spanning about 170 patent families and addressing a broad range of cellular technologies. ipcom has asserted 19 of these patents in litigation against nokia and many of the leading cell phone companies and operators. in november 2014, microsoft and ipcom entered into a standstill agreement staying all of the pending litigation against microsoft to permit the parties to pursue settlement discussions.  interdigital patent litigation  interdigital technology corporation and interdigital communications corporation (collectively, \u0093idt\u0094) filed four patent infringement cases against nokia in the itc and in u.s. district court for the district of delaware between 2007 and 2013. we have been added to these cases as a defendant. idt has cases pending against other defendants based on the same patents because most of the patents at issue allegedly relate to 3g and 4g wireless communications standards essential functionality. the cases involving us include three itc investigations where idt is seeking an order excluding importation of 3g and 4g phones into the u.s. and one active case in u.s. district court in delaware seeking an injunction and damages. the itc issued a finding of no violation relating to two of the investigations, which idt appealed. in february 2015, the u.s. court of appeals for the federal circuit affirmed one of the itc\u0092s findings; the other has been stayed. in the third itc action the administrative law judge (\u0093alj\u0094) issued a determination finding: (1)\u00a0infringement; (2)\u00a0evidence of \u0093reverse hold-up;\u0094 and (3)\u00a0the public interest does not preclude issuance of an exclusion order. the itc is reviewing the alj\u0092s initial determination. the trial in the delaware case is scheduled for november 2015.  european copyright levies  we assumed from nokia all potential liability due to nokia\u0092s alleged failure to pay \u0093private copying levies\u0094 in various european countries based upon sale of memory cards and mobile phones that incorporate blank memory.\u00a0the levies are based upon a 2001 european union (\u0093eu\u0094) directive establishing a right for end users to make copies of copyrighted works for personal or private use, but also allowing the collection of levies based upon sales of blank media or recording devices to compensate copyright holders for private copying.\u00a0various collecting societies in eu countries initiated litigation against nokia, stating that nokia must pay levies not only based upon sales of blank memory cards, but also phones that include blank memory for data storage on the phones, regardless of actual usage of that memory.\u00a0the most significant cases against nokia are pending in germany and austria, due to both the high volume of sales and high levy amounts sought in these countries. since april 2015, we and other major manufacturers have been engaged in settlement negotiations with the german collecting society, with the aim of concluding negotiations by october 2015.  other patent and intellectual property claims  in addition to these cases, there are approximately 70 other patent infringement cases pending against microsoft.  \u00a0 86  table of contents  \u00a0 part ii  item 8  \u00a0 antitrust, unfair competition, and overcharge class actions  a large number of antitrust and unfair competition class action lawsuits were filed against us in various state, federal, and canadian courts on behalf of various classes of direct and indirect purchasers of our pc operating system and certain other software products between 1999 and 2005.  we obtained dismissals or reached settlements of all claims made in the u.s. under the settlements, generally class members can obtain vouchers that entitle them to be reimbursed for purchases of a wide variety of platform-neutral computer hardware and software. the total value of vouchers that we may issue varies by state. we will make available to certain schools a percentage of those vouchers that are not issued or claimed (one-half to two-thirds depending on the state). the total value of vouchers we ultimately issue will depend on the number of class members who make claims and are issued vouchers. we estimate the total remaining cost of the settlements is approximately $200 million, all of which had been accrued as of june\u00a030, 2015.  three similar cases pending in british columbia, ontario, and quebec, canada have not been settled. in 2010, the court in the british columbia case certified it as a class action. after the british columbia court of appeal dismissed the case, in 2013 the canadian supreme court reversed the appellate court and reinstated part of the british columbia case, which is now scheduled for trial in 2016. the other two cases are inactive.  other antitrust litigation and claims  go computer litigation  in june 2005, go computer inc. and co-founder jerry kaplan filed a complaint in california state court asserting antitrust claims under the cartwright act related to the business of the former go corporation in the early 1990s and its successor in interest, lucent corporation in the early 2000s. all claims prior to june 2001 have been dismissed with prejudice as barred by the statute of limitations. the case is moving forward with discovery, and a trial is set for september 2015.  china state administration for industry and commerce investigation   in july 2014, microsoft was informed that china\u0092s state administration for industry and commerce (\u0093saic\u0094) had begun a formal investigation relating to china\u0092s anti-monopoly law, and the saic conducted onsite inspections of microsoft offices in beijing, shanghai, guangzhou, and chengdu.\u00a0saic has stated the investigation relates to compatibility, bundle sales, and file verification issues related to windows and office software.  product-related litigation  u.s. cell phone litigation  nokia, along with other handset manufacturers and network operators, is a defendant in 19 lawsuits filed in the superior court for the district of columbia by individual plaintiffs who allege that radio emissions from cellular handsets caused their brain tumors and other adverse health effects. we have assumed responsibility for these claims as part of the nds acquisition and have been substituted for the nokia defendants. nine of these cases were filed in 2002 and are consolidated for certain pre-trial proceedings; the remaining 10 cases are stayed. in a separate 2009 decision, the court of appeals for the district of columbia held that adverse health effect claims arising from the use of cellular handsets that operate within the u.s. federal communications commission radio frequency emission guidelines (\u0093fcc guidelines\u0094) are pre-empted by federal law. the plaintiffs allege that their handsets either operated outside the fcc guidelines or were manufactured before the fcc guidelines went into effect. the lawsuits also allege an industry-wide conspiracy to manipulate the science and testing around emission guidelines.  in september 2013, defendants in the consolidated cases moved to exclude plaintiffs\u0092 expert evidence of general causation on the basis of flawed scientific methodologies. in march 2014, defendants filed a separate motion to  \u00a0 87  table of contents  \u00a0 part ii  item 8  \u00a0  preclude plaintiffs\u0092 general causation testimony. in august 2014, the court granted in part defendants\u0092 motion to exclude plaintiffs\u0092 general causation experts. the plaintiffs filed an interlocutory appeal. in december 2014, the district of columbia court of appeals agreed to hear en banc defendants\u0092 interlocutory appeal challenging the standard for evaluating expert scientific evidence. trial court proceedings are stayed pending resolution of the appeal.  canadian cell phone class action  nokia, along with other handset manufacturers and network operators, is a defendant in a 2013 class action lawsuit filed in the supreme court of british columbia by a purported class of canadians who have used cellular phones for at least 1,600 hours, including a subclass of users with brain tumors. microsoft was served with the complaint in june 2014 and has been substituted for the nokia defendants. the litigation is not yet active as several defendants remain to be served.  other  we also are subject to a variety of other claims and suits that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of our business. although management currently believes that resolving claims against us, individually or in aggregate, will not have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements, these matters are subject to inherent uncertainties and management\u0092s view of these matters may change in the future.  as of june\u00a030, 2015, we accrued aggregate legal liabilities of $614 million in other current liabilities and $20 million in other long-term liabilities. while we intend to defend these matters vigorously, adverse outcomes that we estimate could reach approximately $1.6 billion in aggregate beyond recorded amounts are reasonably possible. were unfavorable final outcomes to occur, there exists the possibility of a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements for the period in which the effects become reasonably estimable.  note 19 - stockholders\u0092 equity  shares outstanding  shares of common stock outstanding were as follows:  \u00a0 share repurchases  on september\u00a016, 2013, our board of directors approved a share repurchase program authorizing up to $40.0 billion in share repurchases. the share repurchase program became effective on october\u00a01, 2013, has no expiration date, and may be suspended or discontinued at any time without notice. this share repurchase program replaced the share repurchase program that was announced on september\u00a022, 2008 and expired on september\u00a030, 2013. as of june\u00a030, 2015, $21.9 billion

\u00a0 as of june\u00a030, 2015, there was approximately $4.7 billion of total unrecognized compensation costs related to stock awards. these costs are expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 3 years.  during fiscal years 2014 and 2013, the following activity occurred under our stock plans:  \u00a0 \u00a0 total vest-date fair value of stock awards vested was $4.2 billion,

officer, reviews certain financial information, including segmented internal profit and loss statements prepared on a basis not consistent with u.s. gaap. the segment information in this note is reported on that basis. during the periods presented, we reported our financial performance based on the following segments; d&c licensing, computing and gaming hardware, phone hardware, d&c other, commercial licensing, and commercial other.  on april\u00a025, 2014, we acquired substantially all of nds. see note 9 \u0096 business combinations for additional details. nds has been included in our consolidated results of operations since the acquisition date. we report the financial performance of the acquired business in our phone hardware segment. prior to the acquisition of nds, financial results associated with our joint strategic initiatives with nokia were reflected in our d&c licensing segment. the contractual relationship with nokia related to those initiatives ended in conjunction with the acquisition.  our reportable segments are described below.  devices and consumer  our d&c segments develop, manufacture, market, and support products and services designed to entertain and connect people, increase personal productivity, help people simplify tasks and make more informed decisions online, and help advertisers connect with audiences. our d&c segments are:

individual, team, and organizational productivity and efficiency, including simplifying everyday tasks through seamless operations across the user\u0092s hardware and software. our commercial segments are:  \u00a0 \u00a0 revenue and cost of revenue are generally directly attributed to our segments. certain revenue contracts are allocated among the segments based on the relative value of the underlying products and services, which can include allocation based on actual prices charged, prices when sold separately, or estimated costs plus a profit margin. cost of revenue is directly charged to our hardware segments. for the remaining segments, cost of revenue is directly charged in most cases and allocated in certain cases, generally using a relative revenue methodology.  we do not allocate operating expenses to our segments. rather, we allocate them to our two segment groups, devices and consumer and commercial. due to the integrated structure of our business, allocations of expenses are made in certain cases to incent cross-collaboration among our segment groups so that a segment group is not solely burdened by the cost of a mutually beneficial activity as we seek to deliver seamless experiences across devices, whether on-premises or in the cloud.  operating expenses are attributed to our segment groups as follows:  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 certain corporate-level activity is not allocated to our segment groups, including costs of: legal, including expenses, settlements, and fines; information technology; human resources; finance; excise taxes; and impairment, integration, and restructuring expenses.  \u00a0 93  table of contents  \u00a0 part ii  item 8  \u00a0 segment revenue and gross margin were as follows during the periods presented:  \u00a0 \u00a0

operating income (loss) by segment group.  \u00a0 corporate and other operating income includes adjustments to conform our internal accounting policies to u.s. gaap, corporate-level activity not specifically attributed to a segment, and impairment, integration, and restructuring expenses. significant internal accounting policies that differ from u.s. gaap relate to revenue recognition, income statement classification, and depreciation.  corporate and other activity was as follows:  \u00a0 \u00a0 no sales to an individual customer or country other than the united states accounted for more

$2.8 billion, and $1.3 billion in fiscal years 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively. these amounts are included in their respective product categories in the table above.  assets are not allocated to segments for internal reporting presentations. a portion of amortization and depreciation is charged to the respective segment. it is impracticable for us to separately identify the amount of

equity for each of the three years in the period ended june\u00a030, 2015.\u00a0these financial statements are the responsibility of the company\u0092s management. our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.  we conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board (united states).\u00a0those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.\u00a0an audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.\u00a0an audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. we believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.  in our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of microsoft corporation and subsidiaries as of june\u00a030, 2015 and 2014, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended june\u00a030, 2015, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america.  we have also audited, in

business model competition  companies compete with us based on a growing variety of business models.        the competitive pressures described above may cause decreased sales volumes, price reductions, and/or increased operating costs, such as for research and development, marketing, and sales incentives. this may lead to lower revenue, gross margins, and operating income.  our increasing focus on cloud-based services presents execution and competitive risks.\u00a0a growing part of our business involves cloud-based services available across the spectrum of computing devices. our strategic vision is to compete and grow by building best-in-class platforms and productivity services for an intelligent cloud and an intelligent edge infused with artificial intelligence (\u201cai\u201d). at the same time, our competitors are rapidly developing and deploying cloud-based services for consumers and business customers. pricing and delivery models are evolving. devices and form factors influence how users access services in the cloud and sometimes the user\u2019s choice of which cloud-based services to use. we are devoting significant resources to develop and deploy our cloud-based strategies. the windows ecosystem must continue to evolve with this changing environment. we are undertaking cultural and organizational changes to drive accountability and eliminate obstacles to innovation. our intelligent cloud and intelligent edge worldview is connected with the growth of the internet of things (\u201ciot\u201d). our success in the iot will depend on the level of adoption of our offerings such as azure, azure stack, azure iot edge, and azure sphere. we may not establish market share sufficient to achieve scale necessary to achieve our business objectives.besides software development costs, we are incurring costs to build and maintain infrastructure to support cloud computing services. these costs will reduce the operating margins we have previously achieved. whether we succeed in cloud-based services depends on our execution in several areas, including:            it is uncertain whether our strategies will attract the users or generate the revenue required to succeed. if we are not effective in executing organizational and technical changes to increase efficiency and accelerate innovation, or if we fail to generate sufficient usage of our new products and services, we may not grow revenue in line with the infrastructure and development investments described above. this may negatively impact gross margins and operating income.  20part i item 1a \u00a0 we make significant investments in products and services that may not achieve expected returns.\u00a0we will continue to make significant investments in research, development, and marketing for existing products, services, and technologies, including the windows operating system, microsoft 365, office, bing, sql server, windows server, azure, office 365, xbox live, linkedin, and other products and services. we also invest in the development and acquisition of a variety of hardware for productivity, communication, and entertainment including pcs, tablets, gaming devices, and hololens. investments in new technology are speculative. commercial success depends on many factors, including innovativeness, developer support, and effective distribution and marketing. if customers do not perceive our latest offerings as providing significant new functionality or other value, they may reduce their purchases of new software and hardware products or upgrades, unfavorably affecting revenue. we may not achieve significant revenue from new product, service, and distribution channel investments for several years, if at all. new products and services may not be profitable, and even if they are profitable, operating margins for some new products and businesses will not be as high as the margins we have experienced historically. we may not get engagement in certain features, like edge and bing, that drive post-sale monetization opportunities. our data handling practices across our products and services will continue to be under scrutiny and perceptions of mismanagement, driven by regulatory activity or negative public reaction to our practices or product experiences, which could negatively impact product and feature adoption, product design, and product quality.developing new technologies is complex. it can require long development and testing periods. significant delays in new releases or significant problems in creating new products or services could adversely affect our revenue.  acquisitions, joint ventures, and strategic alliances may have an adverse effect on our business.\u00a0we expect to continue making acquisitions and entering into joint ventures and strategic alliances as part of our long-term business strategy. for example, in october 2018, we completed our acquisition of github, inc. (\u201cgithub\u201d) for $7.5 billion. these acquisitions and other transactions and arrangements involve significant challenges and risks, including that they do not advance our business strategy, that we get an unsatisfactory return on our investment, that we have difficulty integrating and retaining new employees, business systems, and technology, or that they distract management from our other businesses. if an arrangement fails to adequately anticipate changing circumstances and interests of a party, it may result in early termination or renegotiation of the arrangement. the success of these transactions and arrangements will depend in part on our ability to leverage them to enhance our existing products and services or develop compelling new ones. it may take longer than expected to realize the full benefits from these transactions and arrangements such as increased revenue or enhanced efficiencies, or the benefits may ultimately be smaller than we expected. these events could adversely affect our consolidated financial statements. if our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets become impaired, we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings.\u00a0we acquire other companies and intangible assets and may not realize all the economic benefit from those acquisitions, which could cause an impairment of goodwill or intangibles. we review our amortizable intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. we test goodwill for impairment at least annually. factors that may be a change in circumstances, indicating that the carrying value of our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets may not be recoverable, include a decline in our stock price and market capitalization, reduced future cash flow estimates, and slower growth rates in industry segments in which we participate. we have in the past recorded, and may in the future be required to record a significant charge in our consolidated financial statements during the period in which any impairment of our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets is determined, negatively affecting our results of operations. 21part i item 1a \u00a0 cyberattacks and security vulnerabilities could lead to reduced revenue, increased costs, liability claims, or harm to our reputation or competitive position.  security of our information technology  threats to it security can take a variety of forms. individual and groups of hackers and sophisticated organizations, including state-sponsored organizations or nation-states, continuously undertake attacks that pose threats to our customers and our it.\u00a0these actors may use a wide variety of methods, which may include developing and deploying malicious software or exploiting vulnerabilities in hardware, software, or other infrastructure in order to attack our products and services or gain access to our networks and datacenters, using social engineering techniques to induce our employees, users, partners, or customers to disclose passwords or other sensitive information or take other actions to gain access to our data or our users\u2019 or customers\u2019 data, or acting in a coordinated manner to launch distributed denial of service or other coordinated attacks. inadequate account security practices may also result in unauthorized access to confidential data. for example, system administrators may fail to timely remove employee account access when no longer appropriate. employees or third parties may intentionally compromise our or our users\u2019 security or systems, or reveal confidential information.cyberthreats are constantly evolving, increasing the difficulty of detecting and successfully defending against them. we may have no current capability to detect certain vulnerabilities, which may allow them to persist in the environment over long periods of time. cyberthreats can have cascading impacts that unfold with increasing speed across our internal networks and systems and those of our partners and customers. breaches of our facilities, network, or data security could disrupt the security of our systems and business applications, impair our ability to provide services to our customers and protect the privacy of their data, result in product development delays, compromise confidential or technical business information harming our reputation or competitive position, result in theft or misuse of our intellectual property or other assets, require us to allocate more resources to improve technologies, or otherwise adversely affect our business.in addition, our internal it environment continues to evolve. often, we are early adopters of new devices and technologies. we embrace new ways of sharing data and communicating internally and with partners and customers using methods such as social networking and other consumer-oriented technologies. our business policies and internal security controls may not keep pace with these changes as new threats emerge. security of our products, services, devices, and customers\u2019 data the security of our products and services is important in our customers\u2019 decisions to purchase or use our products or services. security threats are a significant challenge to companies like us whose business is providing technology products and services to others. threats to our own it infrastructure can also affect our customers. customers using our cloud-based services rely on the security of our infrastructure, including hardware and other elements provided by third parties, to ensure the reliability of our services and the protection of their data. adversaries tend to focus their efforts on the most popular operating systems, programs, and services, including many of ours, and we expect that to continue. adversaries that acquire user account information at other companies can use that information to compromise our users\u2019 accounts where accounts share the same attributes as passwords. inadequate account security practices may also result in unauthorized access. user activity may also result in ransomware or other malicious software impacting a customer\u2019s use of our products or services. we are also increasingly incorporating open source software into our products. there may be vulnerabilities in open source software that may make our products susceptible to cyberattacks.to defend against security threats to our internal it systems, our cloud-based services, and our customers\u2019 systems, we must continuously engineer more secure products and services, enhance security and reliability features, improve the deployment of software updates to address security vulnerabilities in our own products as well as those provided by others, develop mitigation technologies that help to secure customers from attacks even when software updates are not deployed, maintain the digital security infrastructure that protects the integrity of our network, products, and services, and provide security tools such as firewalls and anti-virus software and information about the need to deploy security measures and the impact of doing so. customers in certain industries such as financial services, health care, and government may have enhanced or specialized requirements to which we must engineer our product and services.22part i item 1a \u00a0 the cost of these steps could reduce our operating margins. if we fail to do these things well, actual or perceived security vulnerabilities in our products and services, data corruption issues, or reduced performance could harm our reputation and lead customers to reduce or delay future purchases of products or subscriptions to services, or to use competing products or services. customers may also spend more on protecting their existing computer systems from attack, which could delay adoption of additional products or services. customers, and third parties granted access to their systems, may fail to update their systems, continue to run software or operating systems we no longer support, or may fail timely to install or enable security patches, or may otherwise fail to adopt adequate security practices. any of these could adversely affect our reputation and revenue. actual or perceived vulnerabilities may lead to claims against us. our license agreements typically contain provisions that eliminate or limit our exposure to liability, but there is no assurance these provisions will withstand legal challenges. at times, to achieve commercial objectives, we may enter into agreements with larger liability exposure to customers. our products operate in conjunction with and are dependent on products and components across a broad ecosystem of third parties. if there is a security vulnerability in one of these components, and if there is a security exploit targeting it, we could face increased costs, liability claims, reduced revenue, or harm to our reputation or competitive position. disclosure and misuse of personal data could result in liability and harm our reputation.\u00a0as we continue to grow the number and scale of our cloud-based offerings, we store and process increasingly large amounts of personally identifiable information of our customers and users. the continued occurrence of high-profile data breaches provides evidence of an external environment increasingly hostile to information security. despite our efforts to improve the security controls across our business groups and geographies, it is possible our security controls over personal data, our training of employees and third parties on data security, and other practices we follow may not prevent the improper disclosure or misuse of customer or user data we or our vendors store and manage. in addition, third parties who have limited access to our customer or user data may use this data in unauthorized ways. improper disclosure or misuse could harm our reputation, lead to legal exposure to customers or users, or subject us to liability under laws that protect personal data, resulting in increased costs or loss of revenue. our software products and services also enable our customers and users to store and process personal data on-premises or, increasingly, in a cloud-based environment we host. government authorities can sometimes require us to produce customer or user data in response to valid legal orders. in the u.s. and elsewhere, we advocate for transparency concerning these requests and appropriate limitations on government authority to compel disclosure. despite our efforts to protect customer and user data, perceptions that the collection, use, and retention of personal information is not satisfactorily protected could inhibit sales of our products or services, and could limit adoption of our cloud-based solutions by consumers, businesses, and government entities. additional security measures we may take to address customer or user concerns, or constraints on our flexibility to determine where and how to operate datacenters in response to customer or user expectations or governmental rules or actions, may cause higher operating expenses or hinder growth of our products and services. we may not be able to protect information in our products and services from use by others. linkedin and other microsoft products and services contain valuable information and content protected by contractual restrictions or technical measures. in certain cases, we have made commitments to our members and users to limit access to or use of this information. changes in the law or interpretations of the law may weaken our ability to prevent third parties from scraping or gathering information or content through use of bots or other measures and using it for their own benefit, thus diminishing the value of our products and services. abuse of our platforms may harm our reputation or user engagement.  advertising, professional, and social platform abuses  for platform products and services that provide content or host ads that come from or can be influenced by third parties, including github, linkedin, microsoft advertising, msn, and xbox live, our reputation or user engagement may be negatively affected by activity that is hostile or inappropriate. this activity may come from users impersonating other people or organizations, use of our products or services to spread terrorist or violent extremist content or to disseminate information that may be viewed as misleading or intended to manipulate the opinions of our users, or the use of our products or services that violates our terms of service or otherwise for objectionable or illegal ends. preventing or responding to these actions may require us to make substantial investments in people and technology and these investments may not be successful, adversely affecting our business and consolidated financial statements.23part i item 1a \u00a0 digital safety and service misuse our hosted consumer services as well as our enterprise services may be used by third parties to disseminate harmful or illegal content in violation of our terms or applicable law. we may not proactively discover such content due to scale and the limitations of existing technologies, and when discovered by users, such content may negatively affect our reputation, our brands, and user engagement. regulations and other initiatives to make platforms responsible for preventing or eliminating harmful content online are gaining momentum and we expect this to continue. we may be subject to enhanced regulatory oversight, civil or criminal liability, or reputational damage if we fail to comply with content moderation regulations, adversely affecting our business and consolidated financial statements. the development of the iot presents security, privacy, and execution risks. to support the growth of the intelligent cloud and the intelligent edge, we are developing products, services, and technologies to power the iot, a network of distributed and interconnected devices employing sensors, data, and computing capabilities including ai. the iot\u2019s great potential also carries substantial risks. iot products and services may contain defects in design, manufacture, or operation, that make them insecure or ineffective for their intended purposes. an iot solution has multiple layers of hardware, sensors, processors, software, and firmware, several of which we may not develop or control. each layer, including the weakest layer, can impact the security of the whole system. many iot devices have limited interfaces and ability to be updated or patched. iot solutions may collect large amounts of data, and our handling of iot data may not satisfy customers or regulatory requirements. iot scenarios may increasingly affect personal health and safety. if iot solutions that include our technologies do not work as intended, violate the law, or harm individuals or businesses, we may be subject to legal claims or enforcement actions. these risks, if realized, may increase our costs, damage our reputation or brands, or negatively impact our revenues or margins.\u00a0\u00a0issues in the use of ai in our offerings may result in reputational harm or liability. we are building ai into many of our offerings and we expect this element of our business to grow. we envision a future in which ai operating in our devices, applications, and the cloud helps our customers be more productive in their work and personal lives. as with many disruptive innovations, ai presents risks and challenges that could affect its adoption, and therefore our business. ai algorithms may be flawed. datasets may be insufficient or contain biased information. inappropriate or controversial data practices by microsoft or others could impair the acceptance of ai solutions. these deficiencies could undermine the decisions, predictions, or analysis ai applications produce, subjecting us to competitive harm, legal liability, and brand or reputational harm. some ai scenarios present ethical issues. if we enable or offer ai solutions that are controversial because of their impact on human rights, privacy, employment, or other social issues, we may experience brand or reputational harm.\u00a0\u00a0we may have excessive outages, data losses, and disruptions of our online services if we fail to maintain an adequate operations infrastructure.\u00a0our increasing user traffic, growth in services, and the complexity of our products and services demand more computing power. we spend substantial amounts to build, purchase, or lease datacenters and equipment and to upgrade our technology and network infrastructure to handle more traffic on our websites and in our datacenters. these demands continue to increase as we introduce new products and services and support the growth of existing services such as bing, azure, microsoft account services, office 365, microsoft teams, dynamics 365, onedrive, sharepoint online, skype, xbox live, and outlook.com. we are rapidly growing our business of providing a platform and back-end hosting for services provided by third parties to their end users. maintaining, securing, and expanding this infrastructure is expensive and complex, and requires development of principles for datacenter builds in geographies with higher safety risks. it requires that we maintain an internet connectivity infrastructure and storage and compute capacity that is robust and reliable within competitive and regulatory constraints that continue to evolve. inefficiencies or operational failures, including temporary or permanent loss of customer data, insufficient internet connectivity, or inadequate storage and compute capacity, could diminish the quality of our products, services, and user experience resulting in contractual liability, claims by customers and other third parties, regulatory actions, damage to our reputation, and loss of current and potential users, subscribers, and advertisers, each of which may adversely impact our consolidated financial statements. we may experience quality or supply problems.\u00a0our hardware products such as xbox consoles, surface devices, and other devices we design, manufacture, and market are highly complex and can have defects in design, manufacture, or associated software. we could incur significant expenses, lost revenue, and reputational harm as a result of recalls, safety alerts, or product liability claims if we fail to prevent, detect, or address such issues through design, testing, or warranty repairs.  24part i item 1a \u00a0 our software products and services also may experience quality or reliability problems. the highly sophisticated software we develop may contain bugs and other defects that interfere with their intended operation. our customers increasingly rely on us for critical functions, potentially magnifying the impact of quality or reliability issues. any defects we do not detect and fix in pre-release testing could cause reduced sales and revenue, damage to our reputation, repair or remediation costs, delays in the release of new products or versions, or legal liability. although our license agreements typically contain provisions that eliminate or limit our exposure to liability, there is no assurance these provisions will withstand legal challenge.we acquire some device and datacenter components from sole suppliers. our competitors use some of the same suppliers and their demand for hardware components can affect the capacity available to us. if a component from a sole-source supplier is delayed or becomes unavailable, whether because of supplier capacity constraint, industry shortages, legal or regulatory changes, or other reasons, we may not obtain timely replacement supplies, resulting in reduced sales or inadequate datacenter capacity. component shortages, excess or obsolete inventory, or price reductions resulting in inventory adjustments may increase our cost of revenue. xbox consoles, surface devices, datacenter servers, and other hardware are assembled in asia and other geographies that may be subject to disruptions in the supply chain, resulting in shortages that would affect our revenue and operating margins. these same risks would apply to any other hardware and software products we may offer. we may not be able to protect our source code from copying if there is an unauthorized disclosure.\u00a0source code, the detailed program commands for our operating systems and other software programs, is critical to our business. although we license portions of our application and operating system source code to several licensees, we take significant measures to protect the secrecy of large portions of our source code. if our source code leaks, we might lose future trade secret protection for that code. it may then become easier for third parties to compete with our products by copying functionality, which could adversely affect our revenue and operating margins. unauthorized disclosure of source code also could increase the security risks described elsewhere in these risk factors.legal changes, our evolving business model, piracy, and other factors may decrease the value of our intellectual property. protecting our intellectual property rights and combating unlicensed copying and use of our software and other intellectual property on a global basis is difficult. while piracy adversely affects u.s. revenue, the impact on revenue from outside the u.s. is more significant, particularly countries in which the legal system provides less protection for intellectual property rights. our revenue in these markets may grow more slowly than the underlying device market. similarly, the absence of harmonized patent laws makes it more difficult to ensure consistent respect for patent rights. throughout the world, we educate users about the benefits of licensing genuine products and obtaining indemnification benefits for intellectual property risks, and we educate lawmakers about the advantages of a business climate where intellectual property rights are protected. reductions in the legal protection for software intellectual property rights could adversely affect revenue. we expend significant resources to patent the intellectual property we create with the expectation that we will generate revenues by incorporating that intellectual property in our products or services or, in some instances, by licensing our patents to others in return for a royalty.\u00a0changes in the law may continue to weaken our ability to prevent the use of patented technology or collect revenue for licensing our patents.\u00a0these include legislative changes and regulatory actions that make it more difficult to obtain injunctions, and the increasing use of legal process to challenge issued patents. similarly, licensees of our patents may fail to satisfy their obligations to pay us royalties, or may contest the scope and extent of their obligations. the royalties we can obtain to monetize our intellectual property may decline because of the evolution of technology, selling price changes in products using licensed patents, or the difficulty of discovering infringements. finally, our increasing engagement with open source software will also cause us to license our intellectual property rights broadly in certain situations and may negatively impact revenue.25part i item 1a \u00a0 third parties may claim we infringe their intellectual property rights.\u00a0from time to time, others claim we infringe their intellectual property rights. the number of these claims may grow because of constant technological change in the markets in which we compete, the extensive patent coverage of existing technologies, the rapid rate of issuance of new patents, and our offering of first-party devices, such as surface. to resolve these claims, we may enter into royalty and licensing agreements on terms that are less favorable than currently available, stop selling or redesign affected products or services, or pay damages to satisfy indemnification commitments with our customers. these outcomes may cause operating margins to decline. besides money damages, in some jurisdictions plaintiffs can seek injunctive relief that may limit or prevent importing, marketing, and selling our products or services that have infringing technologies. in some countries, such as germany, an injunction can be issued before the parties have fully litigated the validity of the underlying patents. we have paid significant amounts to settle claims related to the use of technology and intellectual property rights and to procure intellectual property rights as part of our strategy to manage this risk, and may continue to do so. we have claims and lawsuits against us that may result in adverse outcomes.\u00a0we are subject to a variety of claims and lawsuits. these claims may arise from a wide variety of business practices and initiatives, including major new product releases such as windows 10, significant business transactions, warranty or product claims, and employment practices. adverse outcomes in some or all of these claims may result in significant monetary damages or injunctive relief that could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business. the litigation and other claims are subject to inherent uncertainties and management\u2019s view of these matters may change in the future. a material adverse impact in our consolidated financial statements could occur for the period in which the effect of an unfavorable outcome becomes probable and reasonably estimable. government litigation and regulatory activity relating to competition rules may limit how we design and market our products.\u00a0as a leading global software and device maker, government agencies closely scrutinize us under u.s. and foreign competition laws. governments are actively enforcing competition laws and regulations, and this includes scrutiny in potentially large markets such as the european union (\u201ceu\u201d), the u.s., and china. some jurisdictions also allow competitors or consumers to assert claims of anti-competitive conduct. u.s. federal and state antitrust authorities have previously brought enforcement actions and continue to scrutinize our business.  the european commission (\u201cthe commission\u201d) closely scrutinizes the design of high-volume microsoft products and the terms on which we make certain technologies used in these products, such as file formats, programming interfaces, and protocols, available to other companies. flagship product releases such as windows 10 can receive significant scrutiny under competition laws. for example, in 2004, the commission ordered us to create new versions of our windows operating system that do not include certain multimedia technologies and to provide our competitors with specifications for how to implement certain proprietary windows communications protocols in their own products. in 2009, the commission accepted a set of commitments we offered to address the commission\u2019s concerns relating to competition in web browsing software, including an undertaking to address commission concerns relating to interoperability. the web browsing commitments expired in 2014. the remaining obligations may limit our ability to innovate in windows or other products in the future, diminish the developer appeal of the windows platform, and increase our product development costs. the availability of licenses related to protocols and file formats may enable competitors to develop software products that better mimic the functionality of our products, which could hamper sales of our\u00a0products. our portfolio of first-party devices continues to grow; at the same time our oem partners offer a large variety of devices for our platforms. as a result, increasingly we both cooperate and compete with our oem partners, creating a risk that we fail to do so in compliance with competition rules. regulatory scrutiny in this area may increase. certain foreign governments, particularly in china and other countries in asia, have advanced arguments under their competition laws that exert downward pressure on royalties for our intellectual property.  government regulatory actions and court decisions such as these may result in fines, or hinder our ability to provide the benefits of our software to consumers and businesses, reducing the attractiveness of our products and the revenue that come from them. new competition law actions could be initiated, potentially using previous actions as precedent. the outcome of such actions, or steps taken to avoid them, could adversely affect us in a variety of ways, including:    26part i item 1a \u00a0       our global operations subject us to potential liability under anti-corruption, trade protection, and other laws and regulations.\u00a0the foreign corrupt practices act (\u201cfcpa\u201d) and other anti-corruption laws and regulations (\u201canti-corruption laws\u201d) prohibit corrupt payments by our employees, vendors, or agents, and the accounting provisions of the fcpa require us to maintain accurate books and records and adequate internal controls. from time to time, we receive inquiries from authorities in the u.s. and elsewhere which may be based on reports from employees and others about our business activities outside the u.s. and our compliance with anti-corruption laws. periodically, we receive such reports directly and investigate them. on july 22, 2019, our hungarian subsidiary entered into a non-prosecution agreement (\u201cnpa\u201d) with the u.s. department of justice (\u201cdoj\u201d) and we agreed to the terms of a cease and desist order with the securities and exchange commission.\u202fthese agreements required us to pay $25.3 million in monetary penalties, disgorgement, and interest pertaining to activities at microsoft\u2019s subsidiary in hungary.\u00a0the npa, which has a three-year term, also contains certain ongoing compliance requirements, including the obligations to disclose to the doj issues that may implicate the fcpa and to cooperate in any inquiries. most countries in which we operate also have competition laws that prohibit competitors from colluding or otherwise attempting to reduce competition between themselves. while we devote substantial resources to our u.s. and international compliance programs and have implemented policies, training, and internal controls designed to reduce the risk of corrupt payments and collusive activity, our employees, vendors, or agents may violate our policies. our failure to comply with anti-corruption laws or competition laws could result in significant fines and penalties, criminal sanctions against us, our officers, or our employees, prohibitions on the conduct of our business, and damage to our reputation. operations outside the u.s. may be affected by changes in trade protection laws, policies, sanctions, and other regulatory requirements affecting trade and investment. we may be subject to legal liability and reputational damage if we sell goods or services in violation of u.s. trade sanctions on restricted entities or countries such as crimea, cuba, iran, north korea, sudan, and syria. other regulatory areas that may apply to our products and online services offerings include user privacy, telecommunications, data storage and protection, and online content. for example, some regulators are taking the position that our offerings such as microsoft teams and skype are covered by existing laws regulating telecommunications services, and some new laws, including eu member state laws under the european electronic communications code, are defining more of our services as regulated telecommunications services. this trend may continue and will result in these offerings being subjected to additional data protection, security, and law enforcement surveillance obligations. data protection authorities may assert that our collection, use, and management of customer data is inconsistent with their laws and regulations. legislative or regulatory action relating to cybersecurity requirements may increase the costs to develop, implement, or secure our products and services. legislative or regulatory action could also emerge in the area of ai and content moderation, increasing costs or restricting opportunity. applying these laws and regulations to our business is often unclear, subject to change over time, and sometimes may conflict from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. additionally, these laws and governments\u2019 approach to their enforcement, and our products and services, are continuing to evolve. compliance with these types of regulation may involve significant costs or require changes in products or business practices that result in reduced revenue. noncompliance could result in the imposition of penalties or orders we stop the alleged noncompliant activity. we strive to empower all people and organizations to achieve more, and accessibility of our products is an important aspect of this goal. there is increasing pressure from advocacy groups, regulators, competitors, customers, and other stakeholders to make technology more accessible. if our products do not meet customer expectations or emerging global accessibility requirements, we could lose sales opportunities or face regulatory actions 27part i item 1a \u00a0 laws and regulations relating to the handling of personal data may impede the adoption of our services or result in increased costs, legal claims, fines against us, or reputational damage.\u00a0the growth of our internet- and cloud-based services internationally relies increasingly on the movement of data across national boundaries. legal requirements relating to the collection, storage, handling, and transfer of personal data continue to evolve. for example, in july 2020 the court of justice of the eu invalidated a framework called privacy shield for companies to transfer data from eu member states to the united states. this ruling has led to uncertainty about the legal requirements for data transfers from the eu under other legal mechanisms. potential new rules and restrictions on the flow of data across borders could increase the cost and complexity of delivering our products and services in some markets. in may 2018, the eu general data protection regulation (\u201cgdpr\u201d), became effective.\u00a0the law, which applies to all of our activities conducted from an establishment in the eu or related to products and services offered in the eu, imposes a range of compliance obligations regarding the handling of personal data. engineering efforts to build and maintain capabilities to facilitate compliance with the law have entailed substantial expense and the diversion of engineering resources from other projects and may continue to do so. we might experience reduced demand for our offerings if we are unable to engineer products that meet our legal duties or help our customers meet their obligations under the gdpr or other data regulations, or if our implementation to comply with the gdpr makes our offerings less attractive. the gdpr imposes significant new obligations and compliance with these obligations depends in part on how particular regulators interpret and apply them. if we fail to comply with the gdpr, or if regulators assert we have failed to comply with the gdpr, it may lead to regulatory enforcement actions, which can result in monetary penalties of up to 4% of worldwide revenue, private lawsuits, reputational damage, and loss of customers. countries around the world, and states in the u.s. such as california, have adopted, or are considering adopting or expanding, laws and regulations imposing obligations regarding the handling of personal data.the company\u2019s investment in gaining insights from data is becoming central to the value of the services we deliver to customers, to our operational efficiency and key opportunities in monetization, customer perceptions of quality, and operational efficiency. our ability to use data in this way may be constrained by regulatory developments that impede realizing the expected return from this investment. ongoing legal analyses, reviews, and inquiries by regulators of microsoft practices, or relevant practices of other organizations, may result in burdensome or inconsistent requirements, including data sovereignty and localization requirements, affecting the location, movement, collection, and use of our customer and internal employee data as well as the management of that data. compliance with applicable laws and regulations regarding personal data may require changes in services, business practices, or internal systems that result in increased costs, lower revenue, reduced efficiency, or greater difficulty in competing with foreign-based firms. compliance with data regulations might limit our ability to innovate or offer certain features and functionality in some jurisdictions where we operate. failure to comply with existing or new rules may result in significant penalties or orders to stop the alleged noncompliant activity, as well as negative publicity and diversion of management time and effort. we may have additional tax liabilities.\u00a0we are subject to income taxes in the u.s. and many foreign jurisdictions. significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes. in the course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. for example, compliance with the 2017 united states tax cuts and jobs act (\u201ctcja\u201d) may require the collection of information not regularly produced within the company, the use of estimates in our consolidated financial statements, and the exercise of significant judgment in accounting for its provisions. as regulations and guidance evolve with respect to the tcja, and as we gather more information and perform more analysis, our results may differ from previous estimates and may materially affect our consolidated financial statements.we regularly are under audit by tax authorities in different jurisdictions. although we believe that our provision for income taxes and our tax estimates are reasonable, tax authorities may disagree with certain positions we have taken. in addition, economic\u00a0and political\u00a0pressures to increase tax revenue in various jurisdictions may make resolving tax disputes favorably more difficult. we are currently under internal revenue service audit for prior tax years, with the primary unresolved issues relating to transfer pricing. the final resolution of those audits, and other audits or litigation, may differ from the amounts recorded in our consolidated financial statements and may materially affect our consolidated financial statements in the period or periods in which that determination is made.  28part i item 1a \u00a0 we earn a significant amount of our operating income outside the u.s. a change in the mix of earnings and losses in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in our business or structure, or the expiration of or disputes about certain tax agreements in a particular country may result in higher effective tax rates for the company. in addition, changes in u.s. federal and state or international tax laws applicable to corporate multinationals, other fundamental law changes currently being considered by many countries, including in the u.s., and changes in taxing jurisdictions\u2019 administrative interpretations, decisions, policies, and positions may materially adversely impact our consolidated financial statements. if our reputation or our brands are damaged, our business and operating results may be harmed. our reputation and brands are globally recognized and are important to our business. our reputation and brands affect our ability to attract and retain consumer, business, and public-sector customers. there are numerous ways our reputation or brands could be damaged. these include product safety or quality issues, or our environmental impact and sustainability, supply chain practices, or human rights record. we may experience backlash from customers, government entities, advocacy groups, employees, and other stakeholders that disagree with our product offering decisions or public policy positions. damage to our reputation or our brands may occur from, among other things:       the proliferation of social media may increase the likelihood, speed, and magnitude of negative brand events. if our brands or reputation are damaged, it could negatively impact our revenues or margins, or ability to attract the most highly qualified employees. our global business exposes us to operational and economic risks.\u00a0our customers are located throughout the world and a significant part of our revenue comes from international sales. the global nature of our business creates operational and economic risks. our results of operations may be affected by global, regional, and local economic developments, monetary policy, inflation, and recession, as well as political and military disputes. in addition, our international growth strategy includes certain markets, the developing nature of which presents several risks, including deterioration of social, political, labor, or economic conditions in a country or region, and difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations. emerging nationalist trends in specific countries may significantly alter the trade environment. changes to trade policy or agreements as a result of populism, protectionism, or economic nationalism may result in higher tariffs, local sourcing initiatives, or other developments that make it more difficult to sell our products in foreign countries. disruptions of these kinds in developed or emerging markets could negatively impact demand for our products and services or increase operating costs. although we hedge a portion of our international currency exposure, significant fluctuations in foreign exchange rates between the u.s. dollar and foreign currencies may adversely affect our results of operations. our business with government customers may present additional uncertainties. we derive substantial revenue from government contracts. government contracts generally can present risks and challenges not present in private commercial agreements. for instance, we may be subject to government audits and investigations relating to these contracts, we could be suspended or debarred as a governmental contractor, we could incur civil and criminal fines and penalties, and under certain circumstances contracts may be rescinded. some agreements may allow a government to terminate without cause and provide for higher liability limits for certain losses. some contracts may be subject to periodic funding approval, reductions, or delays which could adversely impact public-sector demand for our products and services. these events could negatively impact our results of operations, financial condition, and reputation. adverse economic or market conditions may harm our business.\u00a0worsening economic conditions, including inflation, recession, pandemic, or other changes in economic conditions, may cause lower it spending and adversely affect our revenue. if demand for pcs, servers, and other computing devices declines, or consumer or business spending for those products declines, our revenue will be adversely affected.  our product distribution system relies on an extensive partner and retail network. oems building devices that run our software have also been a significant means of distribution. the impact of economic conditions on our partners, such as the bankruptcy of a major distributor, oem, or retailer, could cause sales channel disruption.  29part i item 1a \u00a0 challenging economic conditions also may impair the ability of our customers to pay for products and services they have purchased. as a result, allowances for doubtful accounts and write-offs of accounts receivable may increase.  we maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings, types, and maturities. these investments are subject to general credit, liquidity, market, and interest rate risks, which may be exacerbated by market downturns or events that affect global financial markets. a significant part of our investment portfolio comprises u.s. government securities. if global financial markets decline for long periods, or if there is a downgrade of the u.s. government credit rating due to an actual or threatened default on government debt, our investment portfolio may be adversely affected and we could determine that more of our investments have experienced an other-than-temporary decline in fair value, requiring impairment charges that could adversely affect our consolidated financial statements. catastrophic events or geopolitical conditions may disrupt our business.\u00a0a disruption or failure of our systems or operations because of a major earthquake, weather event, cyberattack, terrorist attack, pandemic, or other catastrophic event could cause delays in completing sales, providing services, or performing other critical functions. our corporate headquarters, a significant portion of our research and development activities, and certain other essential business operations are in the seattle, washington area, and we have other business operations in the silicon valley area of california, both of which are seismically active regions. a catastrophic event that results in the destruction or disruption of any of our critical business or it systems, or the infrastructure or systems they rely on, such as power grids, could harm our ability to conduct normal business operations. providing our customers with more services and solutions in the cloud puts a premium on the resilience of our systems and strength of our business continuity management plans, and magnifies the potential impact of prolonged service outages in our consolidated financial statements. abrupt political change, terrorist activity, and armed conflict pose a risk of general economic disruption in affected countries, which may increase our operating costs. these conditions also may add uncertainty to the timing and budget for technology investment decisions by our customers, and may cause supply chain disruptions for hardware manufacturers. geopolitical change may result in changing regulatory requirements that could impact our operating strategies, access to global markets, hiring, and profitability. geopolitical instability may lead to sanctions and impact our ability to do business in some markets or with some public-sector customers. any of these changes may negatively impact our revenues.  the occurrence of regional epidemics or a global pandemic may adversely affect our operations, financial condition, and results of operations. the covid-19 pandemic is having widespread, rapidly evolving, and unpredictable impacts on global society, economies, financial markets, and business practices. federal and state governments have implemented measures in an effort to contain the virus, including social distancing, travel restrictions, border closures, limitations on public gatherings, work from home, supply chain logistical changes, and closure of non-essential businesses. to protect the health and well-being of our employees, suppliers, and customers, we have made substantial modifications to employee travel policies, implemented office closures as employees are advised to work from home, and cancelled or shifted our conferences and other marketing events to virtual-only through fiscal year 2021. the covid-19 pandemic has impacted and may continue to impact our business operations, including our employees, customers, partners, and communities, and there is substantial uncertainty in the nature and degree of its continued effects over time.in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal year 2020, we have experienced adverse impacts to our supply chain, a slowdown in transactional licensing, and lower demand for our advertising services. the extent to which the covid-19 pandemic impacts our business going forward will depend on numerous evolving factors we cannot reliably predict, including the duration and scope of the pandemic; governmental, business, and individuals' actions in response to the pandemic; and the impact on economic activity including the possibility of recession or financial market instability. these factors may adversely impact consumer, business, and government spending on technology as well as customers' ability to pay for our products and services on an ongoing basis. this uncertainty also affects management\u2019s accounting estimates and assumptions, which could result in greater variability in a variety of areas that depend on these estimates and assumptions, including investments, receivables, and forward-looking guidance.30part i item 1a \u00a0 measures to contain the virus that impact us, our partners, distributors, and suppliers may further intensify these impacts and other risks described in these risk factors. any of these may adversely impact our ability to:             we may incur increased costs to effectively manage these aspects of our business. if we are unsuccessful it may adversely impact our revenues, cash flows, market share growth, and reputation. the long-term effects of climate change on the global economy and the it industry in particular are unclear. environmental regulations or changes in the supply, demand or available sources of energy or other resources may affect the availability or cost of goods and services, including natural resources, necessary to run our business. changes in climate where we operate may increase the costs of powering and cooling computer hardware we use to develop software and provide cloud-based services. our business depends on our ability to attract and retain talented employees.\u00a0our business is based on successfully attracting and retaining talented employees representing diverse backgrounds, experiences, and skill sets. the market for highly skilled workers and leaders in our industry is extremely competitive. maintaining our brand and reputation, as well as a diverse and inclusive work environment that enables all our employees to thrive, are important to our ability to recruit and retain employees. we are also limited in our ability to recruit internationally by restrictive domestic immigration laws. changes to u.s. immigration policies that restrain the flow of technical and professional talent may inhibit our ability to adequately staff our research and development efforts. if we are less successful in our recruiting efforts, or if we cannot retain highly skilled workers and key leaders, our ability to develop and deliver successful products and services may be adversely affected. effective succession planning is also important to our long-term success. failure to ensure effective transfer of knowledge and smooth transitions involving key employees could hinder our strategic planning and execution. how employment-related laws are interpreted and applied to our workforce practices may result in increased operating costs and less flexibility in how we meet our workforce needs. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 31part ii item 7 \u00a0 economic conditions, challenges, and risks the markets for software, devices, and cloud-based services are dynamic and highly competitive. our competitors are developing new software and devices, while also deploying competing cloud-based services for consumers and businesses. the devices and form factors customers prefer evolve rapidly, and influence how users access services in the cloud, and in some cases, the user\u2019s choice of which suite of cloud-based services to use. we must continue to evolve and adapt over an extended time in pace with this changing environment. the investments we are making in infrastructure and devices will continue to increase our operating costs and may decrease our operating margins. our success is highly dependent on our ability to attract and retain qualified employees. we hire a mix of university and industry talent worldwide. we compete for talented individuals globally by offering an exceptional working environment, broad customer reach, scale in resources, the ability to grow one\u2019s career across many different products and businesses, and competitive compensation and benefits. aggregate demand for our software, services, and devices is correlated to global macroeconomic and geopolitical factors, which remain dynamic. our international operations provide a significant portion of our total revenue and expenses. many of these revenue and expenses are denominated in currencies other than the u.s. dollar. as a result, changes in foreign exchange rates may significantly affect revenue and expenses. strengthening of the u.s. dollar relative to certain foreign currencies did not significantly impact reported revenue or expenses from our international operations in the first and second quarters of fiscal year 2019, and reduced reported revenue and expenses from our international operations in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal year 2019. strengthening of the u.s. dollar relative to certain foreign currencies reduced reported revenue and expenses from our international operations in fiscal year 2020. refer to risk factors (part i, item\u00a01a of this form 10-k) for a discussion of these factors and other risks. covid-19 in fiscal year 2020, the covid-19 pandemic impacted our business operations, including our employees, customers, partners, and communities, and we saw the following trends in our financial operating results. in the productivity and business processes and intelligent cloud segments, cloud usage and demand increased as customers shifted to work and learn from home. we also experienced a slowdown in transactional licensing, particularly in small and medium businesses, and linkedin was negatively impacted by the weak job market and reductions in advertising spend. in the more personal computing segment, windows oem, surface, and gaming benefited from increased demand to support remote work-, play-, and learn-from-home scenarios, while search was negatively impacted by reductions in advertising spend. the covid-19 pandemic may continue to impact our business operations and financial operating results, and there is substantial uncertainty in the nature and degree of its continued effects over time.the extent to which the covid-19 pandemic impacts our business going forward will depend on numerous evolving factors we cannot reliably predict, including the duration and scope of the pandemic; governmental, business, and individuals' actions in response to the pandemic; and the impact on economic activity including the possibility of recession or financial market instability. these factors may adversely impact consumer, business, and government spending on technology as well as customers' ability to pay for our products and services on an ongoing basis. this uncertainty also affects management\u2019s accounting estimates and assumptions, which could result in greater variability in a variety of areas that depend on these estimates and assumptions, including investments, receivables, and forward-looking guidance. refer to risk factors (part i, item\u00a01a of this form 10-k) for a discussion of these factors and other risks.seasonality our revenue fluctuates quarterly and is generally higher in the second and fourth quarters of our fiscal year. second quarter revenue is driven by corporate year-end spending trends in our major markets and holiday season spending by consumers, and fourth quarter revenue is driven by the volume of multi-year on-premises contracts executed during the period. 36part ii item 7 \u00a0 reportable segments we report our financial performance based on the following segments: productivity and business processes, intelligent cloud, and more personal computing. the segment amounts included in md&a are presented on a basis consistent with our internal management reporting. all differences between our internal management reporting basis and accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america (\u201cgaap\u201d), along with certain corporate-level and other activity, are included in corporate and other. additional information on our reportable segments is contained in note 19 \u2013 segment information and geographic data of the notes to financial statements (part ii, item\u00a08 of this form 10-k).  metrics we use metrics in assessing the performance of our business and to make informed decisions regarding the allocation of resources. we disclose metrics to enable investors to evaluate progress against our ambitions, provide transparency into performance trends, and reflect the continued evolution of our products and services. our commercial and other business metrics are fundamentally connected based on how customers use our products and services. the metrics are disclosed in the md&a or the notes to financial statements (part ii, item\u00a08 of this form 10-k). financial metrics are calculated based on gaap results and growth comparisons relate to the corresponding period of last fiscal year. commercial our commercial business primarily consists of server products and cloud services, office commercial, windows commercial, the commercial portion of linkedin, enterprise services, and dynamics. our commercial metrics allow management and investors to assess the overall health of our commercial business and include leading indicators of future performance. \u00a0   \u00a0 37part ii item 7 \u00a0 productivity and business processes and intelligent cloud metrics related to our productivity and business processes and intelligent cloud segments assess the health of our core businesses within these segments. the metrics reflect our cloud and on-premises product strategies and trends.  \u00a0   more personal computing metrics related to our more personal computing segment assess the performance of key lines of business within this segment. these metrics provide strategic product insights which allow us to assess the performance across our commercial and consumer businesses. as we have diversity of target audiences and sales motions within the windows business, we monitor metrics that are reflective of those varying motions. \u00a0   \u00a0 38part ii item 7 \u00a0 summary results of operations \u00a0   \u00a0 non-gaap net income and diluted earnings per share (\u201ceps\u201d) exclude the net tax impact of transfer of intangible properties in fiscal year 2019  and the net tax impact of the tax cuts and jobs act (\u201ctcja\u201d) in fiscal years 2019 and 2018. refer to the non-gaap financial measures section below for a reconciliation of our financial results reported in accordance with gaap to non-gaap financial results. fiscal year 2020 compared with fiscal year 2019 revenue increased $17.2 billion or 14%, driven by growth across each of our segments. intelligent cloud revenue increased, driven by server products and cloud services. productivity and business processes revenue increased, driven by office commercial and linkedin. more personal computing revenue increased, driven by windows and surface. gross margin increased $14.0 billion or 17%, driven by growth across each of our segments. gross margin percentage increased, driven by sales mix shift to higher margin businesses. commercial cloud gross margin percentage increased 4 points to 67%, primarily driven by improvement in azure. operating income increased $10.0 billion or 23%, driven by growth across each of our segments. key changes in expenses were:         gross margin and operating income included an unfavorable foreign currency impact of 2% and 4%, respectively. prior year net income included a $2.6 billion net income tax benefit related to intangible property transfers and a $157 million net charge related to the enactment of the tcja, which together resulted in an increase to net income and diluted eps of $2.4 billion and $0.31, respectively.  fiscal year 2019 compared with fiscal year 2018 revenue increased $15.5 billion or 14%, driven by growth across each of our segments. intelligent cloud revenue increased, driven by server products and cloud services. productivity and business processes revenue increased, driven by office and linkedin. more personal computing revenue increased, driven by surface, gaming, and windows. gross margin increased $10.9 billion or 15%, driven by growth across each of our segments. gross margin percentage increased slightly, due to gross margin percentage improvement across each of our segments and favorable segment sales mix. gross margin included a 5 percentage point improvement in commercial cloud, primarily from azure. 39part ii item 7 \u00a0 operating income increased $7.9 billion or 23%, driven by growth across each of our segments. key changes in expenses were:       fiscal year 2019 net income included a $2.6 billion net income tax benefit related to intangible property transfers and a $157 million net charge related to the enactment of the tcja, which together resulted in an increase to net income and diluted eps of $2.4 billion and $0.31, respectively. fiscal year 2018 net income and diluted eps were negatively impacted by the net charge related to the enactment of the tcja, which resulted in a decrease to net income and diluted eps of $13.7 billion and $1.75, respectively. segment results of operations  \u00a0   reportable segments  fiscal year 2020 compared with fiscal year 2019 productivity and business processes  revenue increased $5.2 billion or 13%.          40part ii item 7 \u00a0 operating income increased $2.5 billion or 15%.     revenue, gross margin, and operating income included an unfavorable foreign currency impact of 2%, 2%, and 4%, respectively. intelligent cloud  revenue increased $9.4 billion or 24%.      operating income increased $4.4 billion or 32%.      revenue, gross

42part ii item 7 \u00a0     operating income increased $2.2 billion or 21%, including an unfavorable foreign currency impact of 2%.      operating expenses research and development  \u00a0   \u00a0 research and development expenses include payroll, employee benefits, stock-based compensation expense, and other headcount-related expenses associated with product development. research and development expenses also include third-party development and programming costs, localization costs incurred to translate software for international markets, and the amortization of purchased software code and services content.  fiscal year 2020 compared with fiscal year 2019 research and development expenses increased $2.4 billion or 14%, driven by investments in cloud engineering, linkedin, devices, and gaming.  fiscal year 2019 compared with fiscal year 2018 research and development expenses increased $2.2 billion or 15%, driven by investments in cloud and ai engineering, gaming, linkedin, and github. sales and marketing  \u00a0   \u00a0 sales and marketing expenses include payroll, employee benefits, stock-based compensation expense, and other headcount-related expenses associated with sales and marketing personnel, and the costs of advertising, promotions, trade shows, seminars, and other programs.  fiscal year 2020 compared with fiscal year 2019 sales and marketing expenses increased $1.4 billion or 8%, driven by investments in linkedin and commercial sales, and an increase in bad debt expense.  43part ii item 7 \u00a0 fiscal year 2019 compared with fiscal year 2018 sales and marketing expenses increased $744 million or 4%, driven by investments in commercial sales capacity, linkedin, and github, offset in part by a decrease in marketing. expenses included a favorable foreign currency impact of 2%.  general and administrative  \u00a0   \u00a0 general and administrative expenses include payroll, employee benefits, stock-based compensation expense, severance expense, and other headcount-related expenses associated with finance, legal, facilities, certain human resources and other administrative personnel, certain taxes, and legal and other administrative fees. fiscal year 2020 compared with fiscal year 2019 general and administrative expenses increased $226 million or 5%, driven by charges associated with the closing of our microsoft store physical locations, offset in part by a reduction in business taxes and legal expenses. fiscal year 2019 compared with fiscal year 2018 general and administrative expenses increased $131 million or 3%. other income (expense), net  the components of other income (expense), net were as follows:  \u00a0   we use derivative instruments to: manage risks related to foreign currencies, equity prices, interest rates, and credit; enhance investment returns; and facilitate portfolio diversification. gains and losses from changes in fair values of derivatives that are not designated as hedging instruments are primarily recognized in other income (expense), net.  fiscal year 2020 compared with fiscal year 2019 interest and dividends income decreased due to lower yields, offset in part by higher average portfolio balances on fixed-income securities. interest expense decreased due to capitalization of interest expense and a decrease in outstanding long-term debt due to debt maturities, offset in part by debt exchange transaction fees and higher finance lease expense. net recognized gains on investments decreased due to lower gains and higher other-than-temporary impairments on equity investments, offset in part by gains on fixed income securities in the current period compared to losses in the prior period. net gains on derivatives increased due to higher gains on foreign exchange and equity derivatives. 44part ii item 7 \u00a0 fiscal year 2019 compared with fiscal year 2018 interest and dividends income increased primarily due to higher yields on fixed-income securities. interest expense decreased primarily driven by a decrease in outstanding long-term debt due to debt maturities, offset in part by higher finance lease expense. net recognized gains on investments decreased primarily due to lower gains on sales of equity investments. net gains on derivatives includes gains on foreign exchange and interest rate derivatives in the current period as compared to losses in the prior period.  income taxes  effective tax rate fiscal year 2020 compared with fiscal year 2019 our effective tax rate for fiscal years 2020 and 2019 was 17% and 10%, respectively.\u00a0the increase in our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2020 compared to fiscal year 2019 was primarily due to a $2.6 billion net income tax benefit in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2019 related to intangible property transfers. our effective tax rate was lower than the u.s. federal statutory rate, primarily due to earnings taxed at lower rates in foreign jurisdictions resulting from producing and distributing our products and services through our foreign regional operations centers in ireland and puerto rico, and tax benefits relating to stock-based compensation. the mix of income before income taxes between the u.s. and foreign countries impacted our effective tax rate as a result of the geographic distribution of, and customer demand for, our products and services. in fiscal year 2020, our u.s. income before income taxes was $24.1 billion and our foreign income before income taxes was $28.9 billion. in fiscal year 2019, our u.s. income before income taxes was $15.8 billion and our foreign income before income taxes was $27.9 billion. fiscal year 2019 compared with fiscal year 2018  our effective tax rate for fiscal years 2019 and 2018 was 10% and 55%, respectively.\u00a0the decrease in our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2019 compared to fiscal year 2018 was primarily due to the net charge related to the enactment of the tcja in the second quarter of fiscal year 2018 and a $2.6 billion net income tax benefit in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2019 related to intangible property transfers. our effective tax rate was lower than the u.s. federal statutory rate, primarily due to the tax benefit related to intangible property transfers, and earnings taxed at lower rates in foreign jurisdictions resulting from producing and distributing our products and services through our foreign regional operations centers in ireland, singapore, and puerto rico. the mix of income before income taxes between the u.s. and foreign countries impacted our effective tax rate as a result of the geographic distribution of, and customer demand for, our products and services. in fiscal year 2019, our u.s. income before income taxes was $15.8 billion and our foreign income before income taxes was $27.9 billion. in fiscal year 2018, our u.s. income before income taxes was $11.5 billion and our foreign income before income taxes was $24.9 billion. tax cuts and jobs act  on december 22, 2017, the tcja was enacted into law, which significantly changed existing u.s. tax law and included numerous provisions that affect our business. we recorded a provisional net charge of $13.7 billion related to the enactment of the tcja in fiscal year 2018, and adjusted the provisional net charge by recording additional tax expense of $157 million in fiscal year 2019 pursuant to securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin no. 118.  in fiscal year 2019, in response to the tcja and recently issued regulations, we transferred certain intangible properties held by our foreign subsidiaries to the u.s. and ireland. the transfers of intangible properties resulted in a $2.6 billion net income tax benefit recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2019, as the value of future tax deductions exceeded the current tax liability from foreign jurisdictions and u.s. global intangible low-taxed income tax. refer to note 12 \u2013 income taxes of the notes to financial statements (part ii, item\u00a08 of this form 10-k) for further discussion. 45part ii item 7 \u00a0 uncertain tax positions we settled a portion of the internal revenue service (\u201cirs\u201d) audit for tax years 2004 to 2006 in fiscal year 2011. in february 2012, the irs withdrew its 2011 revenue agents report related to unresolved issues for tax years 2004 to 2006 and reopened the audit phase of the examination. we also settled a portion of the irs audit for tax years 2007 to 2009 in fiscal year 2016, and a portion of the irs audit for tax years 2010 to 2013 in fiscal year 2018. we remain under audit for tax years 2004 to 2013. in april 2020, the irs commenced the audit for tax years 2014 to 2017.  as of june 30, 2020, the primary unresolved issues for the irs audits relate to transfer pricing, which could have a material impact in our consolidated financial statements when the matters are resolved. we believe our allowances for income tax contingencies are adequate. we have not received a proposed assessment for the unresolved issues and do not expect a final resolution of these issues in the next 12 months.\u00a0based on the information currently available, we do not anticipate a significant increase or decrease to our tax contingencies for these issues within the next 12 months. we are subject to income tax in many jurisdictions outside the u.s. our operations in certain jurisdictions remain subject to examination for tax years 1996 to 2019, some of which are currently under audit by local tax authorities. the resolution of each of these audits is not expected to be material to our consolidated financial statements. non-gaap financial measures non-gaap net income and diluted eps are non-gaap financial measures which exclude the net tax impact of transfer of intangible properties in fiscal year 2019 and the net tax impact of the tcja in fiscal years 2019 and 2018. we believe these non-gaap measures aid investors by providing additional insight into our operational performance and help clarify trends affecting our business. for comparability of reporting, management considers non-gaap measures in conjunction with gaap financial results in evaluating business performance. these non-gaap financial measures presented should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, the measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with gaap. the following table reconciles our financial results reported in accordance with gaap to non-gaap financial results: \u00a0   \u00a0   46part ii item 7 \u00a0 financial condition  cash, cash equivalents, and investments  cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments totaled $136.5 billion and $133.8 billion as of june 30, 2020 and 2019. equity investments were $3.0 billion and $2.6 billion as of june 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively. our short-term investments are primarily intended to facilitate liquidity and capital preservation. they consist predominantly of highly liquid investment-grade fixed-income securities, diversified among industries and individual issuers. the investments are predominantly u.s. dollar-denominated securities, but also include foreign currency-denominated securities to diversify risk. our fixed-income investments are exposed to interest rate risk and credit risk. the credit risk and average maturity of our fixed-income portfolio are managed to achieve economic returns that correlate to certain fixed-income indices. the settlement risk related to these investments is insignificant given that the short-term investments held are primarily highly liquid investment-grade fixed-income securities. valuation  in general, and where applicable, we use quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities to determine the fair value of our financial instruments. this pricing methodology applies to our level 1 investments, such as u.s. government securities, common and preferred stock, and mutual funds. if quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities are not available to determine fair value, then we use quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities or inputs other than the quoted prices that are observable either directly or indirectly. this pricing methodology applies to our level 2 investments, such as commercial paper, certificates of deposit, u.s. agency securities, foreign government bonds, mortgage- and asset-backed securities, corporate notes and bonds, and municipal securities. level 3 investments are valued using internally-developed models with unobservable inputs. assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis using unobservable inputs are an immaterial portion of our portfolio. a majority of our investments are priced by pricing vendors and are generally level 1 or level 2 investments as these vendors either provide a quoted market price in an active market or use observable inputs for their pricing without applying significant adjustments. broker pricing is used mainly when a quoted price is not available, the investment is not priced by our pricing vendors, or when a broker price is more reflective of fair values in the market in which the investment trades. our broker-priced investments are generally classified as level 2 investments because the broker prices these investments based on similar assets without applying significant adjustments. in addition, all our broker-priced investments have a sufficient level of trading volume to demonstrate that the fair values used are appropriate for these investments. our fair value processes include controls that are designed to ensure appropriate fair values are recorded. these controls include model validation, review of key model inputs, analysis of period-over-period fluctuations, and independent recalculation of prices where appropriate. cash flows  fiscal year 2020 compared with fiscal year 2019 cash from operations increased $8.5 billion to $60.7 billion for fiscal year 2020, mainly due to an increase in cash from customers, offset in part by an increase in cash used to pay income taxes, suppliers, and employees. cash used in financing increased $9.1 billion to $46.0 billion for fiscal year 2020, mainly due to a $3.4 billion cash premium on our debt exchange, a $3.4 billion increase in common stock repurchases, a $1.5 billion increase in repayments of debt, and a $1.3 billion increase in dividends paid. cash used in investing decreased $3.6 billion to $12.2 billion for fiscal year 2020, mainly due to a $6.4 billion increase in cash from net investment purchases, sales, and maturities, offset in part by a $1.5 billion increase in additions to property and equipment and $1.2 billion in other investing to facilitate the purchase of components. 47part ii item 7 \u00a0 fiscal year 2019 compared with fiscal year 2018  cash from operations increased $8.3 billion to $52.2 billion for fiscal year 2019, mainly due to an increase in cash received from customers, offset in part by an increase in cash paid to suppliers and employees and an increase in cash paid for income taxes. cash used in financing increased $3.3 billion to $36.9 billion for fiscal year 2019, mainly due to an $8.8 billion increase in common stock repurchases and a $1.1 billion increase in dividends paid, offset in part by a $6.2 billion decrease in repayments of debt, net of proceeds from issuance of debt. cash used in investing increased $9.7 billion to $15.8 billion for fiscal year 2019, mainly due to a $6.0 billion decrease in cash from net investment purchases, sales, and maturities, a $2.3 billion increase in additions to property and equipment, and a $1.5 billion increase in cash used for acquisitions of companies, net of cash acquired, and purchases of intangible and other assets.debt  we issue debt to take advantage of favorable pricing and liquidity in the debt markets, reflecting our credit rating and the low interest rate environment. the proceeds of these issuances were or will be used for general corporate purposes, which may include, among other things, funding for working capital, capital expenditures, repurchases of capital stock, acquisitions, and repayment of existing debt. in june 2020, we exchanged a portion of our existing debt at premium for cash and new debt with longer maturities to take advantage of favorable financing rates in the debt markets, reflecting our credit rating and the low interest rate environment. refer to note 11 \u2013 debt of the notes to financial statements (part ii, item\u00a08 of this form 10-k) for further discussion. unearned revenue  unearned revenue comprises mainly unearned revenue related to volume licensing programs, which may include software assurance (\u201csa\u201d) and cloud services. unearned revenue is generally invoiced annually at the beginning of each contract period for multi-year agreements and recognized ratably over the coverage period. unearned revenue also includes payments for other offerings for which we have been paid in advance and earn the revenue when we transfer control of the product or service. refer to note 1 \u2013 accounting policies of the notes to financial statements (part ii, item 8 of this form 10-k) for further discussion. the following table outlines the expected future recognition of unearned revenue as of june 30, 2020: \u00a0   if our customers choose to license cloud-based versions of our products and services rather than licensing transaction-based products and services, the associated revenue will shift from being recognized at the time of the transaction to being recognized over the subscription period or upon consumption, as applicable.  share repurchases  for fiscal years 2020, 2019, and 2018, we repurchased 126 million shares, 150 million shares, and 99 million shares of our common stock for $19.7 billion, $16.8 billion, and $8.6 billion, respectively, through our share repurchase programs. all repurchases were made using cash resources. refer to note 16 \u2013 stockholders\u2019 equity of the notes to financial statements (part ii, item\u00a08 of this form 10-k) for further discussion. dividends  refer to note 16 \u2013 stockholders\u2019 equity of the notes to financial statements (part ii, item\u00a08 of this form 10-k) for further discussion. 48part ii item 7 \u00a0 off-balance sheet arrangements  we provide indemnifications of varying scope and size to certain customers against claims of intellectual property infringement made by third parties arising from the use of our products and certain other matters. additionally, we have agreed to cover damages resulting from breaches of certain security and privacy commitments in our cloud business. in evaluating estimated losses on these obligations, we consider factors such as the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and our ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss. these obligations did not have a material impact in our consolidated financial statements during the periods presented.  contractual obligations  the following table summarizes the payments due by fiscal year for our outstanding contractual obligations as of june 30, 2020:  \u00a0   \u00a0             other planned uses of capital  we will continue to invest in sales, marketing, product support infrastructure, and existing and advanced areas of technology, as well as continue making acquisitions that align with our business strategy. additions to property and equipment will continue, including new facilities, datacenters, and computer systems for research and development, sales and marketing, support, and administrative staff. we expect capital expenditures to increase in coming years to support growth in our cloud offerings. we have operating and finance leases for datacenters, corporate offices, research and development facilities, retail stores, and certain equipment. we have not engaged in any related party transactions or arrangements with unconsolidated entities or other persons that are reasonably likely to materially affect liquidity or the availability of capital resources. liquidity as a result of the tcja, we are required to pay a one-time transition tax on deferred foreign income not previously subject to u.s. income tax. under the tcja, the transition tax is payable in interest-free installments over eight years, with 8% due in each of the first five years, 15% in year six, 20% in year seven, and 25% in year eight. we have paid transition tax of $3.2 billion, which included $1.2 billion for fiscal year 2020. the remaining transition tax of $15.2 billion is payable over the next six years with a final payment in fiscal year 2026. during fiscal year 2020, we also paid $3.7 billion related to the transfer of intangible properties that occurred in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2019. 49part ii item 7 \u00a0 we expect existing cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, cash flows from operations, and access to capital markets to continue to be sufficient to fund our operating activities and cash commitments for investing and financing activities, such as dividends, share repurchases, debt maturities, material capital expenditures, and the transition tax related to the tcja, for at least the next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future.  recent accounting guidance  refer to note 1 \u2013 accounting policies of the notes to financial statements (part ii, item\u00a08 of this form 10-k) for further discussion. application of critical accounting policies  our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with gaap. preparing consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. these estimates and assumptions are affected by management\u2019s application of accounting policies, as well as uncertainty in the current economic environment due to the recent outbreak of covid-19. critical accounting policies for us include revenue recognition, impairment of investment securities, goodwill, research and development costs, contingencies, income taxes, and inventories.  revenue recognition  our contracts with customers often include promises to transfer multiple products and services to a customer. determining whether products and services are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately versus together may require significant judgment. when a cloud-based service includes both on-premises software licenses and cloud services, judgment is required to determine whether the software license is considered distinct and accounted for separately, or not distinct and accounted for together with the cloud service and recognized over time. certain cloud services, primarily office 365, depend on a significant level of integration, interdependency, and interrelation between the desktop applications and cloud services, and are accounted for together as one performance obligation. revenue from office 365 is recognized ratably over the period in which the cloud services are provided. judgment is required to determine the stand-alone selling price (\u201cssp\") for each distinct performance obligation. we use a single amount to estimate ssp for items that are not sold separately, including on-premises licenses sold with sa or software updates provided at no additional charge. we use a range of amounts to estimate ssp when we sell each of the products and services separately and need to determine whether there is a discount to be allocated based on the relative ssp of the various products and services.  in instances where ssp is not directly observable, such as when we do not sell the product or service separately, we determine the ssp using information that may include market conditions and other observable inputs. we typically have more than one ssp for individual products and services due to the stratification of those products and services by customers and circumstances. in these instances, we may use information such as the size of the customer and geographic region in determining the ssp.  due to the various benefits from and the nature of our sa program, judgment is required to assess the pattern of delivery, including the exercise pattern of certain benefits across our portfolio of customers.  our products are generally sold with a right of return, we may provide other credits or incentives, and in certain instances we estimate customer usage of our products and services, which are accounted for as variable consideration when determining the amount of revenue to recognize. returns and credits are estimated at contract inception and updated at the end of each reporting period if additional information becomes available. changes to our estimated variable consideration were not material for the periods presented.  50part ii item 7 \u00a0 impairment of investment securities  we review debt investments quarterly for indicators of other-than-temporary impairment. this determination requires significant judgment. in making this judgment, we employ a systematic methodology quarterly that considers available quantitative and qualitative evidence in evaluating potential impairment of our investments. if the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value, we evaluate, among other factors, general market conditions, credit quality of debt instrument issuers, and the duration and extent to which the fair value is less than cost. we also evaluate whether we have plans to sell the security or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery. in addition, we consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of and business outlook for the investee, including industry and sector performance, changes in technology, and operational and financing cash flow factors. once a decline in fair value is determined to be other-than-temporary, an impairment charge is recorded in other income (expense), net and a new cost basis in the investment is established. if market, industry, and/or investee conditions deteriorate, we may incur future impairments. equity investments without readily determinable fair values are written down to fair value if a qualitative assessment indicates that the investment is impaired and the fair value of the investment is less than carrying value. we perform a qualitative assessment on a quarterly basis. we are required to estimate the fair value of the investment to determine the amount of the impairment loss. once an investment is determined to be impaired, an impairment charge is recorded in other income (expense), net.  goodwill  we allocate goodwill to reporting units based on the reporting unit expected to benefit from the business combination. we evaluate our reporting units on an annual basis and, if necessary, reassign goodwill using a relative fair value allocation approach. goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level (operating segment or one level below an operating segment) on an annual basis (may 1 for us) and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. these events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate, legal factors, operating performance indicators, competition, or sale or disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit.  application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment, including the identification of reporting units, assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units, assignment of goodwill to reporting units, and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit. the fair value of each reporting unit is estimated primarily through the use of a discounted cash flow methodology. this analysis requires significant judgments, including estimation of future cash flows, which is dependent on internal forecasts, estimation of the long-term rate of growth for our business, estimation of the useful life over which cash flows will occur, and determination of our weighted average cost of capital.  the estimates used to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit change from year to year based on operating results, market conditions, and other factors. changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and goodwill impairment for each reporting unit.  research and development costs  costs incurred internally in researching and developing a computer software product are charged to expense until technological feasibility has been established for the product. once technological feasibility is established, software costs are capitalized until the product is available for general release to customers. judgment is required in determining when technological feasibility of a product is established. we have determined that technological feasibility for our software products is reached after all high-risk development issues have been resolved through coding and testing. generally, this occurs shortly before the products are released to production. the amortization of these costs is included in cost of revenue over the estimated life of the products.  51part ii item 7 \u00a0 legal and other contingencies  the outcomes of legal proceedings and claims brought against us are subject to significant uncertainty. an estimated loss from a loss contingency such as a legal proceeding or claim is accrued by a charge to income if it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. in determining whether a loss should be accrued we evaluate, among other factors, the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss. changes in these factors could materially impact our consolidated financial statements. income taxes  the objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year, and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entity\u2019s financial statements or tax returns. we recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. accounting literature also provides guidance on derecognition of income tax assets and liabilities, classification of deferred income tax assets and liabilities, accounting for interest and penalties associated with tax positions, and income tax disclosures. judgment is required in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements or tax returns. variations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could materially impact our consolidated financial statements. the tcja significantly changes existing u.s. tax law and includes numerous provisions that affect our business. refer to note 12 \u2013 income taxes of the notes to financial statements (part ii, item 8 of this form 10-k) for further discussion. inventories  inventories are stated at average cost, subject to the lower of cost or net realizable value. cost includes materials, labor, and manufacturing overhead related to the purchase and production of inventories. net realizable value is the estimated selling price less estimated costs of completion, disposal, and transportation. we regularly review inventory quantities on hand, future purchase commitments with our suppliers, and the estimated utility of our inventory. these reviews include analysis of demand forecasts, product life cycle status, product development plans, current sales levels, pricing strategy, and component cost trends. if our review indicates a reduction in utility below carrying value, we reduce our inventory to a new cost basis through a charge to cost of revenue. change in accounting estimate in july 2020, we completed an assessment of the useful lives of our server and network equipment and determined we should increase the estimated useful life of server equipment from\u00a0three years\u00a0to\u00a0four years and increase the estimated useful life of network equipment from two years to four years. this change in accounting estimate will be effective beginning fiscal year 2021. based on the carrying amount of server and network equipment included in \u201cproperty and equipment, net\u201d as of june 30, 2020, it is estimated this change will increase our fiscal year 2021 operating income by $2.7 billion. \u00a0 52part ii item 7 \u00a0 statement of management\u2019s responsibility for financial statements  management is responsible for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements and related information that are presented in this report. the consolidated financial statements, which include amounts based on management\u2019s estimates and judgments, have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america.  the company designs and maintains accounting and internal control systems to provide reasonable assurance at reasonable cost that assets are safeguarded against loss from unauthorized use or disposition, and that the financial records are reliable for preparing consolidated financial statements and maintaining accountability for assets. these systems are augmented by written policies, an organizational structure providing division of responsibilities, careful selection and training of qualified personnel, and a program of internal audits.  the company engaged deloitte\u00a0& touche llp, an independent registered public accounting firm, to audit and render an opinion on the consolidated financial statements and internal control over financial reporting in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board (united states).  the board of directors, through its audit committee, consisting solely of independent directors of the company, meets periodically with management, internal auditors, and our independent registered public accounting firm to ensure that each is meeting its responsibilities and to discuss matters concerning internal controls and financial reporting. deloitte\u00a0& touche llp and the internal auditors each have full and free access to the audit committee.  \u00a0   \u00a0 53part ii item 7a \u00a0 item\u00a07a.\u00a0quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk risks  we are exposed to economic risk from foreign exchange rates, interest rates, credit risk, and equity prices. we use derivatives instruments to manage these risks, however, they may still impact our consolidated financial statements.  foreign currencies  certain forecasted transactions, assets, and liabilities are exposed to foreign currency risk. we monitor our foreign currency exposures daily to maximize the economic effectiveness of our foreign currency positions, including hedges. principal currency exposures include the euro, japanese yen, british pound, canadian dollar, and australian dollar.  interest rate  securities held in our fixed-income portfolio are subject to different interest rate risks based on their maturities. we manage the average maturity of the fixed-income portfolio to achieve economic returns that correlate to certain global fixed-income indices.  credit our fixed-income portfolio is diversified and consists primarily of investment-grade securities. we manage credit exposures relative to broad-based indices and to facilitate portfolio diversification.  equity  securities held in our equity investments portfolio are subject to price risk.\u00a0  sensitivity analysis the following table sets forth the potential loss in future earnings or fair values, including associated derivatives, resulting from hypothetical changes in relevant market rates or prices:  \u00a0   \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 54part ii item 8 \u00a0 notes to financial statements  note 1 \u2014 accounting policies  accounting principles  our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america (\u201cgaap\u201d).  we have recast certain prior period amounts  to conform to the current period presentation. the recast of these prior period amounts had no impact on our consolidated balance sheets, consolidated income statements, or net cash from or used in operating, financing, or investing on our consolidated cash flows statements.  principles of consolidation  the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of microsoft corporation and its subsidiaries. intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated.  estimates and assumptions  preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. examples of estimates and assumptions include: for revenue recognition, determining the nature and timing of satisfaction of performance obligations, and determining the standalone selling price (\u201cssp\u201d) of performance obligations, variable consideration, and other obligations such as product returns and refunds; loss contingencies; product warranties; the fair value of and/or potential impairment of goodwill and intangible assets for our reporting units; product life cycles; useful lives of our tangible and intangible assets; allowances for doubtful accounts; the market value of, and demand for, our inventory; stock-based compensation forfeiture rates; when technological feasibility is achieved for our products; the potential outcome of uncertain tax positions that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements or tax returns; and determining the timing and amount of impairments for investments. actual results and outcomes may differ from management\u2019s estimates and assumptions due to risks and uncertainties, including uncertainty in the current economic environment due to the recent outbreak of a novel strain of the coronavirus (\u201ccovid-19\u201d).in july 2020, we completed an assessment of the useful lives of our server and network equipment and determined we should increase the estimated useful life of server equipment from\u00a0three years\u00a0to\u00a0four years and increase the estimated useful life of network equipment from two years to four years. this change in accounting estimate will be effective  beginning fiscal year 2021.foreign currencies  assets and liabilities recorded in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rate on the balance sheet date. revenue and expenses are translated at average rates of exchange prevailing during the year. translation adjustments resulting from this process are recorded to other comprehensive income.  revenue\u00a0\u00a0 product revenue and service and other revenue  product revenue includes sales from operating systems; cross-device productivity applications; server applications; business solution applications; desktop and server management tools; software development tools; video games; and hardware such as pcs, tablets, gaming and entertainment consoles, other intelligent devices, and related accessories.  service and other revenue includes sales from cloud-based solutions that provide customers with software, services, platforms, and content such as office 365, azure, dynamics 365, and xbox live; solution support; and consulting services. service and other revenue also includes sales from online advertising and linkedin. 60part ii item 8 \u00a0 revenue recognition revenue is recognized upon transfer of control of promised products or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those products or services. we enter into contracts that can include various combinations of products and services, which are generally capable of being distinct and accounted for as separate performance obligations. revenue is recognized net of allowances for returns and any taxes collected from customers, which are subsequently remitted to governmental authorities.  nature of products and services licenses for on-premises software provide the customer with a right to use the software as it exists when made available to the customer. customers may purchase perpetual licenses or subscribe to licenses, which provide customers with the same functionality and differ mainly in the duration over which the customer benefits from the software. revenue from distinct on-premises licenses is recognized upfront at the point in time when the software is made available to the customer. in cases where we allocate revenue to software updates, primarily because the updates are provided at no additional charge, revenue is recognized as the updates are provided, which is generally ratably over the estimated life of the related device or license. certain volume licensing programs, including enterprise agreements, include on-premises licenses combined with software assurance (\u201csa\u201d). sa conveys rights to new software and upgrades released over the contract period and provides support, tools, and training to help customers deploy and use products more efficiently. on-premises licenses are considered distinct performance obligations when sold with sa. revenue allocated to sa is generally recognized ratably over the contract period as customers simultaneously consume and receive benefits, given that sa comprises distinct performance obligations that are satisfied over time.\u00a0\u00a0 cloud services, which allow customers to use hosted software over the contract period without taking possession of the software, are provided on either a subscription or consumption basis. revenue related to cloud services provided on a subscription basis is recognized ratably over the contract period. revenue related to cloud services provided on a consumption basis, such as the amount of storage used in a period, is recognized based on the customer utilization of such resources. when cloud services require a significant level of integration and interdependency with software and the individual components are not considered distinct, all revenue is recognized over the period in which the cloud services are provided.  revenue from search advertising is recognized when the advertisement appears in the search results or when the action necessary to earn the revenue has been completed. revenue from consulting services is recognized as services are provided.  our hardware is generally highly dependent on, and interrelated with, the underlying operating system and cannot function without the operating system. in these cases, the hardware and software license are accounted for as a single performance obligation and revenue is recognized at the point in time when ownership is transferred to resellers or directly to end customers through retail stores and online marketplaces.  refer to note 19 \u2013 segment information and geographic data for further information, including revenue by significant product and service offering. significant judgments our contracts with customers often include promises to transfer multiple products and services to a customer. determining whether products and services are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately versus together may require significant judgment. when a cloud-based service includes both on-premises software licenses and cloud services, judgment is required to determine whether the software license is considered distinct and accounted for separately, or not distinct and accounted for together with the cloud service and recognized over time. certain cloud services, primarily office 365, depend on a significant level of integration, interdependency, and interrelation between the desktop applications and cloud services, and are accounted for together as one performance obligation. revenue from office 365 is recognized ratably over the period in which the cloud services are provided.61part ii item 8 \u00a0 judgment is required to determine the ssp for each distinct performance obligation. we use a single amount to estimate ssp for items that are not sold separately, including on-premises licenses sold with sa or software updates provided at no additional charge. we use a range of amounts to estimate ssp when we sell each of the products and services separately and need to determine whether there is a discount to be allocated based on the relative ssp of the various products and services.  in instances where ssp is not directly observable, such as when we do not sell the product or service separately, we determine the ssp using information that may include market conditions and other observable inputs. we typically have more than one ssp for individual products and services due to the stratification of those products and services by customers and circumstances. in these instances, we may use information such as the size of the customer and geographic region in determining the ssp.\u00a0\u00a0 due to the various benefits from and the nature of our sa program, judgment is required to assess the pattern of delivery, including the exercise pattern of certain benefits across our portfolio of customers.\u00a0\u00a0 our products are generally sold with a right of return, we may provide other credits or incentives, and in certain instances we estimate customer usage of our products and services, which are accounted for as variable consideration when determining the amount of revenue to recognize. returns and credits are estimated at contract inception and updated at the end of each reporting period if additional information becomes available. changes to our estimated variable consideration were not material for the periods presented. contract balances\u00a0\u00a0 timing of revenue recognition may differ from the timing of invoicing to customers. we record a receivable when revenue is recognized prior to invoicing, or unearned revenue when revenue is recognized subsequent to invoicing. for multi-year agreements, we generally invoice customers annually at the beginning of each annual coverage period. we record a receivable related to revenue recognized for multi-year on-premises licenses as we have an unconditional right to invoice and receive payment in the future related to those licenses.  as of june 30, 2020 and 2019, long-term accounts receivable, net of allowance for doubtful accounts, was $2.7 billion and $2.2 billion, respectively, and is included in other long-term assets in our consolidated balance sheets. the allowance for doubtful accounts reflects our best estimate of probable losses inherent in the accounts receivable balance. we determine the allowance based on known troubled accounts, historical experience, and other currently available evidence.  activity in the allowance for doubtful accounts was as follows:\u00a0 \u00a0   \u00a0 allowance for doubtful accounts included in our consolidated balance sheets: \u00a0   \u00a0 62part ii item 8 \u00a0 unearned revenue comprises mainly unearned revenue related to volume licensing programs, which may include sa and cloud services. unearned revenue is generally invoiced annually at the beginning of each contract period for multi-year agreements and recognized ratably over the coverage period. unearned revenue also includes payments for consulting services to be performed in the future; linkedin subscriptions; office 365 subscriptions; xbox live subscriptions; windows 10 post-delivery support; dynamics business solutions; skype prepaid credits and subscriptions; and other offerings for which we have been paid in advance and earn the revenue when we transfer control of the product or service. refer to note 13 \u2013 unearned revenue for further information, including unearned revenue by segment and changes in unearned revenue during the period. payment terms and conditions vary by contract type, although terms generally include a requirement of payment within 30 to 60 days. in instances where the timing of revenue recognition differs from the timing of invoicing, we have determined our contracts generally do not include a significant financing component. the primary purpose of our invoicing terms is to provide customers with simplified and predictable ways of purchasing our products and services, not to receive financing from our customers or to provide customers with financing. examples include invoicing at the beginning of a subscription term with revenue recognized ratably over the contract period, and multi-year on-premises licenses that are invoiced annually with revenue recognized upfront. we record financing receivables when we offer certain of our customers the option to acquire our software products and services offerings through a financing program in a limited number of countries. as of june 30, 2020 and 2019, our financing receivables, net were $5.2 billion and $4.3 billion, respectively, for short-term and long-term financing receivables, which are included in other current assets and other long-term assets in our consolidated balance sheets. we record an allowance to cover expected losses based on troubled accounts, historical experience, and other currently available evidence.\u00a0 assets recognized from costs to obtain a contract with a customer we recognize an asset for the incremental costs of obtaining a contract with a customer if we expect the benefit of those costs to be longer than one year. we have determined that certain sales incentive programs meet the requirements to be capitalized. total capitalized costs to obtain a contract were immaterial during the periods presented and are included in other current and long-term assets in our consolidated balance sheets.  we apply a practical expedient to expense costs as incurred for costs to obtain a contract with a customer when the amortization period would have been one year or less. these costs include our internal sales force compensation program and certain partner sales incentive programs as we have determined annual compensation is commensurate with annual sales activities. cost of revenue  cost of revenue includes: manufacturing and distribution costs for products sold and programs licensed; operating costs related to product support service centers and product distribution centers; costs incurred to include software on pcs sold by original equipment manufacturers (\u201coem\u201d), to drive traffic to our websites, and to acquire online advertising space; costs incurred to support and maintain online products and services, including datacenter costs and royalties; warranty costs; inventory valuation adjustments; costs associated with the delivery of consulting services; and the amortization of capitalized software development costs. capitalized software development costs are amortized over the estimated lives of the products. product warranty  we provide for the estimated costs of fulfilling our obligations under hardware and software warranties at the time the related revenue is recognized. for hardware warranties, we estimate the costs based on historical and projected product failure rates, historical and projected repair costs, and knowledge of specific product failures (if any). the specific hardware warranty terms and conditions vary depending upon the product sold and the country in which we do business, but generally include parts and labor over a period generally ranging from 90\u00a0days to three years. for software warranties, we estimate the costs to provide bug fixes, such as security patches, over the estimated life of the software. we regularly reevaluate our estimates to assess the adequacy of the recorded warranty liabilities and adjust the amounts as necessary. 63part ii item 8 \u00a0 research and development  research and development expenses include payroll, employee benefits, stock-based compensation expense, and other headcount-related expenses associated with product development. research and development expenses also include third-party development and programming costs, localization costs incurred to translate software for international markets, and the amortization of purchased software code and services content. such costs related to software development are included in research and development expense until the point that technological feasibility is reached, which for our software products, is generally shortly before the products are released to production. once technological feasibility is reached, such costs are capitalized and amortized to cost of revenue over the estimated lives of the products. sales and marketing  sales and marketing expenses include payroll, employee benefits, stock-based compensation expense, and other headcount-related expenses associated with sales and marketing personnel, and the costs of advertising, promotions, trade shows, seminars, and other programs. advertising costs are expensed as incurred. advertising expense was $1.6 billion in fiscal years 2020, 2019, and 2018. stock-based compensation  compensation cost for stock awards, which include restricted stock units (\u201crsus\u201d) and performance stock units (\u201cpsus\u201d), is measured at the fair value on the grant date and recognized as expense, net of estimated forfeitures, over the related service or performance period. the fair value of stock awards is based on the quoted price of our common stock on the grant date less the present value of expected dividends not received during the vesting period. we measure the fair value of psus using a monte carlo valuation model. compensation cost for rsus is recognized using the straight-line method and for psus is recognized using the accelerated method. compensation expense for the employee stock purchase plan (\u201cespp\u201d) is measured as the discount the employee is entitled to upon purchase and is recognized in the period of purchase. income taxes  income tax expense includes u.s. and international income taxes, and interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions. certain income and expenses are not reported in tax returns and financial statements in the same year. the tax effect of such temporary differences is reported as deferred income taxes. deferred tax assets are reported net of a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized. all deferred income taxes are classified as long-term in our consolidated balance sheets.  financial instruments investments we consider all highly liquid interest-earning investments with a maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase to be cash equivalents. the fair values of these investments approximate their carrying values. in general, investments with original maturities of greater than three months and remaining maturities of less than one year are classified as short-term investments. investments with maturities beyond one year may be classified as short-term based on their highly liquid nature and because such marketable securities represent the investment of cash that is available for current operations.  64part ii item 8 \u00a0 debt investments are classified as available-for-sale and realized gains and losses are recorded using the specific identification method. changes in fair value, excluding other-than-temporary impairments, are recorded in other comprehensive income. debt investments are impaired when a decline in fair value is judged to be other-than-temporary. fair value is calculated based on publicly available market information or other estimates determined by management. we employ a systematic methodology on a quarterly basis that considers available quantitative and qualitative evidence in evaluating potential impairment of our investments. if the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value, we evaluate, among other factors, general market conditions, credit quality of debt instrument issuers, and the duration and extent to which the fair value is less than cost. we also evaluate whether we have plans to sell the security or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery. in addition, we consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of, and business outlook, for the investee, including industry and sector performance, changes in technology, and operational and financing cash flow factors. once a decline in fair value is determined to be other-than-temporary, an impairment charge is recorded in other income (expense), net and a new cost basis in the investment is established. equity investments with readily determinable fair values are measured at fair value. equity investments without readily determinable fair values are measured using the equity method or measured at cost with adjustments for observable changes in price or impairments (referred to as the measurement alternative). we perform a qualitative assessment on a quarterly basis and recognize an impairment if there are sufficient indicators that the fair value of the investment is less than carrying value. changes in value are recorded in other income (expense), net.  derivatives derivative instruments are recognized as either assets or liabilities and measured at fair value. the accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation.  for derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges, gains and losses are recognized in other income (expense), net with offsetting gains and losses on the hedged items. gains and losses representing hedge components excluded from the assessment of effectiveness are recognized in other income (expense), net. for derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges, gains and losses are initially reported as a component of other comprehensive income and subsequently recognized in earnings with the corresponding hedged item. gains and losses representing hedge components excluded from the assessment of effectiveness are recognized in earnings.  for derivative instruments that are not designated as hedges, gains and losses from changes in fair values are primarily recognized in other income (expense), net. fair value measurements we account for certain assets and liabilities at fair value. the hierarchy below lists three levels of fair value based on the extent to which inputs used in measuring fair value are observable in the market.\u00a0we categorize each of our fair value measurements in one of these three levels based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. these levels are:     65part ii item 8 \u00a0  we measure equity investments without readily determinable fair values on a nonrecurring basis. the fair values of these investments are determined based on valuation techniques using the best information available, and may include quoted market prices, market comparables, and discounted cash flow projections.  our other current financial assets and current financial liabilities have fair values that approximate their carrying values. inventories  inventories are stated at average cost, subject to the lower of cost or net realizable value. cost includes materials, labor, and manufacturing overhead related to the purchase and production of inventories. net realizable value is the estimated selling price less estimated costs of completion, disposal, and transportation. we regularly review inventory quantities on hand, future purchase commitments with our suppliers, and the estimated utility of our inventory. if our review indicates a reduction in utility below carrying value, we reduce our inventory to a new cost basis through a charge to cost of revenue.  property and equipment  property and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation, and depreciated using the straight-line method over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the asset or the lease term. the estimated useful lives of our property and equipment are generally as follows: computer software developed or acquired for internal use, three to seven years; computer equipment, two to three years; buildings and improvements, five to 15 years; leasehold improvements, three to 20 years; and furniture and equipment, one to 10 years. land is not depreciated. leases we determine if an arrangement is a lease at inception. operating leases are included in operating lease right-of-use (\u201crou\u201d) assets, other current liabilities, and operating lease liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets. finance leases are included in property and equipment, other current liabilities, and other long-term liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets.\u00a0\u00a0 rou assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. operating lease rou assets and liabilities are recognized at commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. as most of our leases do not provide an implicit rate, we generally use our incremental borrowing rate based on the estimated rate of interest for collateralized borrowing over a similar term of the lease payments at commencement date. the operating lease rou asset also includes any lease payments made and excludes lease incentives. our lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. lease expense for lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. we have lease agreements with lease and non-lease components, which are generally accounted for separately. for certain equipment leases, such as vehicles, we account for the lease and non-lease components as a single lease component. additionally, for certain equipment leases, we apply a portfolio approach to effectively account for the operating lease rou assets and liabilities.  goodwill  goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level (operating segment or one level below an operating segment) on an annual basis (may 1 for us) and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value.  66part ii item 8 \u00a0 intangible assets  our intangible assets are subject to amortization and are amortized using the straight-line method over their estimated period of benefit, ranging from one to 20 years. we evaluate the recoverability of intangible assets periodically by taking into account events or circumstances that may warrant revised estimates of useful lives or that indicate the asset may be impaired. recent accounting guidance  recently adopted accounting guidance financial instruments \u2013 targeted improvements to accounting for hedging activities  in august 2017, the financial accounting standards board (\u201cfasb\u201d) issued new guidance related to accounting for hedging activities. this guidance expands strategies that qualify for hedge accounting, changes how many hedging relationships are presented in the financial statements, and simplifies the application of hedge accounting in certain situations. we adopted the standard effective july 1, 2019. as we did not hold derivative instruments requiring an adjustment upon adoption, there was no impact in our consolidated financial statements. adoption of the standard enhanced the presentation of the effects of our hedging instruments and the hedged items in our consolidated financial statements to increase the understandability of the results of our hedging strategies. recent accounting guidance not yet adopted financial instruments \u2013 credit losses  in june 2016, the fasb issued a new standard to replace the incurred loss impairment methodology under current gaap with a methodology that reflects expected credit losses and requires consideration of a broader range of reasonable and supportable information to inform credit loss estimates. we will be required to use a forward-looking expected credit loss model for accounts receivable, loans, and other financial instruments. credit losses relating to available-for-sale debt securities will also be recorded through an allowance for credit losses rather than as a reduction in the amortized cost basis of the securities. the standard will be adopted upon the effective date for us beginning july 1, 2020. adoption of the standard will be applied using a modified retrospective approach through a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the effective date to align our credit loss methodology with the new standard. we have evaluated the impact of this standard in our consolidated financial statements, including accounting policies, processes, and systems. we continue to monitor economic implications of the covid-19 pandemic. based on current market conditions, adoption of the standard will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. accounting for income taxes in december 2019, the fasb issued a new standard to simplify the accounting for income taxes. the guidance eliminates certain exceptions related to the approach for intraperiod tax allocation, the methodology for calculating income taxes in an interim period, and the recognition of deferred tax liabilities for outside basis differences related to changes in ownership of equity method investments and foreign subsidiaries.\u00a0the guidance also simplifies aspects of accounting for franchise taxes and enacted changes in tax laws or rates, and clarifies the accounting for transactions that result in a step-up in the tax basis of goodwill. the standard will be effective for us beginning july 1, 2021, with early adoption permitted. we are currently evaluating the impact of this standard in our consolidated financial statements, including accounting policies, processes, and systems.\u00a0 note 2 \u2014 earnings per share basic earnings per share (\u201ceps\u201d) is computed based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. diluted eps is computed based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock plus the effect of dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period using the treasury stock method. dilutive potential common shares include outstanding stock options and stock awards. 67part ii item 8 \u00a0 the components of basic and diluted eps were as follows: \u00a0   \u00a0 anti-dilutive stock-based awards excluded from the calculations of diluted eps were immaterial during the periods presented. note 3 \u2014 other income (expense), net  the components of other income (expense), net were as follows:  \u00a0   \u00a0 net recognized gains (losses) on investments  net recognized gains (losses) on debt investments were as follows:  \u00a0   \u00a0 net recognized gains (losses) on equity investments were as follows: \u00a0   \u00a0 68part ii item 8 \u00a0 note 4\u00a0\u2014\u00a0investments investment components  the components of investments were as follows:  \u00a0   \u00a0 69part ii item 8 \u00a0   \u00a0   \u00a0 equity investments presented as \u201cother\u201d in the tables above include investments without readily determinable fair values measured using the equity method or measured at cost with adjustments for observable changes in price or impairments, and investments measured at fair value using net asset value as a practical expedient which are not categorized in the fair value hierarchy. as of june 30, 2020 and 2019, equity investments without readily determinable fair values measured at cost with adjustments for observable changes in price or impairments were $1.4 billion and $1.2 billion, respectively. unrealized losses on debt investments  debt investments with continuous unrealized losses for less than 12 months and 12 months or greater and their related fair values were as follows:  \u00a0   \u00a0 70part ii item 8 \u00a0   \u00a0 unrealized losses from fixed-income securities are primarily attributable to changes in interest rates. management does not believe any remaining unrealized losses represent other-than-temporary impairments based on our evaluation of available evidence.  debt investment maturities  \u00a0   \u00a0 note 5 \u2014 derivatives  we use derivative instruments to manage risks related to foreign currencies, interest rates, equity prices, and credit; to enhance investment returns; and to facilitate portfolio diversification. our objectives for holding derivatives include reducing, eliminating, and efficiently managing the economic impact of these exposures as effectively as possible. our derivative programs include strategies that both qualify and do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment.  foreign currencies  certain forecasted transactions, assets, and liabilities are exposed to foreign currency risk. we monitor our foreign currency exposures daily to maximize the economic effectiveness of our foreign currency hedge positions. foreign currency risks related to certain non-u.s. dollar-denominated investments are hedged using foreign exchange forward contracts that are designated as fair value hedging instruments. foreign currency risks related to certain euro-denominated debt are hedged using foreign exchange forward contracts that are designated as cash flow hedging instruments. in the past, option and forward contracts were used to hedge a portion of forecasted international revenue and were designated as cash flow hedging instruments. principal currencies hedged included the euro, japanese yen, british pound, canadian dollar, and australian dollar. certain options and forwards not designated as hedging instruments are also used to manage the variability in foreign exchange rates on certain balance sheet amounts and to manage other foreign currency exposures.\u00a0  71part ii item 8 \u00a0 interest rate  interest rate risks related to certain fixed-rate debt are hedged using interest rate swaps that are designated as fair value hedging instruments to effectively convert the fixed interest rates to floating interest rates. securities held in our fixed-income portfolio are subject to different interest rate risks based on their maturities. we manage the average maturity of our fixed-income portfolio to achieve economic returns that correlate to certain broad-based fixed-income indices using exchange-traded option and futures contracts and over-the-counter swap and option contracts. these contracts are not designated as hedging instruments and are included in \u201cother contracts\u201d in the tables below. equity  securities held in our equity investments portfolio are subject to market price risk.\u00a0at times, we may hold options, futures, and swap contracts. these contracts are not designated as hedging instruments and are included in \u201cother contracts\u201d in the tables below. credit  our fixed-income portfolio is diversified and consists primarily of investment-grade securities. we use credit default swap contracts to manage credit exposures relative to broad-based indices and to facilitate portfolio diversification. these contracts are not designated as hedging instruments and are included in \u201cother contracts\u201d in the tables below. credit-risk-related contingent features  certain of our counterparty agreements for derivative instruments contain provisions that require our issued and outstanding long-term unsecured debt to maintain an investment grade credit rating and require us to maintain minimum liquidity of $1.0 billion. to the extent we fail to meet these requirements, we will be required to post collateral, similar to the standard convention related to over-the-counter derivatives. as of june 30, 2020, our long-term unsecured debt rating was aaa, and cash investments were in excess of $1.0 billion. as a result, no collateral was required to be posted. the following table presents the notional amounts of our outstanding derivative instruments measured in u.s. dollar equivalents: \u00a0   \u00a0 72part ii item 8 \u00a0 fair values of derivative instruments  the following table presents our derivative instruments:  \u00a0   \u00a0 gross derivative assets and liabilities subject to legally enforceable master netting agreements for which we have elected to offset were $399 million and $399 million, respectively, as of june 30, 2020, and $247 million and $272 million, respectively, as of june 30, 2019. \u00a0the following table presents the fair value of our derivatives instruments on a gross basis: \u00a0   \u00a0 73part ii item 8 \u00a0 gains (losses) on derivative instruments recognized in our consolidated income statements were as follows: \u00a0   \u00a0 gains (losses), net of tax, on derivative instruments recognized in our consolidated comprehensive income statements were as follows: \u00a0   \u00a0 note 6\u00a0\u2014\u00a0inventories  the components of inventories were as follows:  \u00a0   \u00a0 74part ii item 8 \u00a0 note 7 \u2014 property and equipment  the components of property and equipment were as follows:  \u00a0   \u00a0 during fiscal years 2020, 2019, and 2018, depreciation expense was $10.7 billion, $9.7 billion, and $7.7 billion, respectively. we have committed $5.0 billion for the construction of new buildings, building improvements, and leasehold improvements as of june 30, 2020. during fiscal year 2020, we recorded an impairment charge of $186 million to property and equipment, primarily to leasehold improvements, due to the closing of our microsoft store physical locations. note 8 \u2014 business combinations  github, inc. on october 25, 2018, we acquired github, inc. (\u201cgithub\u201d), a software development platform, in a $7.5 billion stock transaction (inclusive of total cash payments of $1.3 billion in respect of vested github equity awards and an indemnity escrow). the acquisition is expected to empower developers to achieve more at every stage of the development lifecycle, accelerate enterprise use of github, and bring microsoft\u2019s developer tools and services to new audiences. the financial results of github have been included in our consolidated financial statements since the date of the acquisition. github is reported as part of our intelligent cloud segment.the allocation of the purchase price to goodwill was completed as of june 30, 2019. the major classes of assets and liabilities to which we allocated the purchase price were as follows:\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0   the goodwill recognized in connection with the acquisition is primarily attributable to anticipated synergies from future growth and is not expected to be deductible for tax purposes. we assigned the goodwill to our intelligent cloud segment.\u00a0\u00a0 75part ii item 8 \u00a0 following are the details of the purchase price allocated to the intangible assets acquired:  \u00a0   transactions recognized separately from the purchase price allocation were approximately $600 million, primarily related to equity awards recognized as expense over the related service period.  \u00a0 other during fiscal year 2020, we completed 15 acquisitions for $2.4 billion, substantially all of which were paid in cash. these entities have been included in our consolidated results of operations since their respective acquisition dates. the effects of these business combinations, individually and in aggregate, were not material to our consolidated results of operations.note 9 \u2014 goodwill  changes in the carrying amount of goodwill were as follows:  \u00a0   \u00a0   the measurement periods for the valuation of assets acquired and liabilities assumed end as soon as information on the facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition dates becomes available, but do not exceed 12 months. adjustments in purchase price allocations may require a change in the amounts allocated to goodwill during the periods in which the adjustments are determined.  any change in the goodwill amounts resulting from foreign currency translations and purchase accounting adjustments are presented as \u201cother\u201d in the table above. also included in \u201cother\u201d are business dispositions and transfers between segments due to reorganizations, as applicable.  goodwill impairment\u00a0\u00a0 we test goodwill for impairment annually on may\u00a01 at the reporting unit level, primarily using a discounted cash flow methodology with a peer-based, risk-adjusted weighted average cost of capital. we believe use of a discounted cash flow approach is the most reliable indicator of the fair values of the businesses.  no instances of impairment were identified in our may 1, 2020, may 1, 2019, or may 1, 2018 tests. as of june 30, 2020 and 2019, accumulated goodwill impairment was $11.3 billion.76part ii item 8 \u00a0 note 10\u00a0\u2014\u00a0intangible assets  the components of intangible assets, all of which are finite-lived, were as follows:  \u00a0     no material impairments of intangible assets were identified during fiscal years 2020, 2019, or 2018. we estimate that we have no significant residual value related to our intangible assets.  the components of intangible assets acquired during the periods presented were as follows:  \u00a0   \u00a0 intangible assets amortization expense was $1.6 billion, $1.9 billion, and $2.2 billion for fiscal years 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. the following table outlines the estimated future amortization expense related to intangible assets held as of june 30, 2020:  \u00a0   \u00a0 77part ii item 8 \u00a0 note 11\u00a0\u2014\u00a0debt  the components of debt were as follows:  \u00a0   \u00a0     as of june 30, 2020 and 2019, the estimated fair value of long-term debt, including the current portion, was $77.1 billion and $78.9 billion, respectively. the estimated fair values are based on level 2 inputs.  debt in the table above is comprised of senior unsecured obligations and ranks equally with our other outstanding obligations. interest is paid semi-annually, except for the euro-denominated debt, which is paid annually.  the following table outlines maturities of our long-term debt, including the current portion, as of june 30, 2020:  \u00a0   \u00a0 78part ii item 8 \u00a0 note 12\u00a0\u2014\u00a0income taxes  tax cuts and jobs act on december 22, 2017, the tax cuts and jobs act (\u201ctcja\u201d) was enacted into law, which significantly changed existing u.s. tax law and included numerous provisions that affect our business. we recorded a provisional net charge of $13.7 billion related to the enactment of the tcja in fiscal year 2018, and adjusted the provisional net charge by recording additional tax expense of $157 million in fiscal year 2019 pursuant to securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin no. 118.  in fiscal year 2019, in response to the tcja and recently issued regulations, we transferred certain intangible properties held by our foreign subsidiaries to the u.s. and ireland. the transfers of intangible properties resulted in a $2.6 billion net income tax benefit recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2019, as the value of future tax deductions exceeded the current tax liability from foreign jurisdictions and u.s. global intangible low-taxed income (\u201cgilti\u201d) tax.  provision for income taxes\u00a0\u00a0 the components of the provision for income taxes were as follows:  \u00a0   \u00a0 u.s. and foreign components of income before income taxes were as follows:  \u00a0   \u00a0 79part ii item 8 \u00a0 effective tax rate the items accounting for the difference between income taxes computed at the u.s. federal statutory rate and our effective rate were as follows:  \u00a0   \u00a0 the decrease from the federal statutory rate in fiscal year 2020 is primarily due to earnings taxed at lower rates in foreign jurisdictions resulting from producing and distributing our products and services through our foreign regional operations centers in ireland and puerto rico, and tax benefits relating to stock-based compensation. the decrease from the federal statutory rate in fiscal year 2019 is primarily due to a $2.6 billion net income tax benefit related to intangible property transfers, and earnings taxed at lower rates in foreign jurisdictions resulting from producing and distributing our products and services through our foreign regional operations centers in ireland, singapore, and puerto rico. the increase from the federal statutory rate in fiscal year 2018 is primarily due to the net charge related to the enactment of the tcja in the second quarter of fiscal year 2018, offset in part by earnings taxed at lower rates in foreign jurisdictions. in fiscal year 2020, our foreign regional operating centers in ireland and puerto rico, which are taxed at rates lower than the u.s. rate, generated 86% of our foreign income before tax. in fiscal years 2019 and 2018, our foreign regional operating centers in ireland, singapore, and puerto rico, which are taxed at rates lower than the u.s. rate, generated 82% and 87% of our foreign income before tax, respectively. other reconciling items, net consists primarily of tax credits and gilti tax. in fiscal years 2020, 2019, and 2018, there were no individually significant other reconciling items.\u00a0 the increase in our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2020 compared to fiscal year 2019 was primarily due to a $2.6 billion net income tax benefit in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2019 related to intangible property transfers. the decrease in our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2019 compared to fiscal year 2018 was primarily due to the net charge related to the enactment of the tcja in the second quarter of fiscal year 2018, and a $2.6 billion net income tax benefit in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2019 related to intangible property transfers. 80part ii item 8 \u00a0 the components of the deferred income tax assets and liabilities were as follows: \u00a0 \u00a0   \u00a0 deferred income tax balances reflect the effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases and are stated at enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when the taxes are paid or recovered.  as of june 30, 2020, we had federal, state, and foreign net operating loss carryforwards of $547 million, $975 million, and $2.0 billion, respectively. the federal and state net operating loss carryforwards will expire in various years from fiscal 2021 through 2040, if not utilized. the majority of our foreign net operating loss carryforwards do not expire. certain acquired net operating loss carryforwards are subject to an annual limitation, but are expected to be realized with the exception of those which have a valuation allowance.the valuation allowance disclosed in the table above relates to the foreign net operating loss carryforwards and other net deferred tax assets that may not be realized. in fiscal year 2020, we removed $2.0 billion of foreign net operating losses and corresponding valuation allowances as a result of the liquidation of a foreign subsidiary. there was no impact to our consolidated financial statements. income taxes paid, net of refunds, were $12.5 billion, $8.4 billion, and $5.5 billion in fiscal years 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively.  uncertain tax positions gross unrecognized tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions as of june 30, 2020, 2019, and 2018, were $13.8 billion, $13.1 billion, and $12.0 billion, respectively, which were primarily included in long-term income taxes in our consolidated balance sheets. if recognized, the resulting tax benefit would affect our effective tax rates for fiscal years 2020, 2019, and 2018 by $12.1 billion, $12.0 billion, and $11.3 billion, respectively.81part ii item 8 \u00a0 as of june 30, 2020, 2019, and 2018, we had accrued interest expense related to uncertain tax positions of $4.0 billion, $3.4 billion, and $3.0 billion, respectively, net of income tax benefits. the provision for income taxes for fiscal years 2020, 2019, and 2018 included interest expense related to uncertain tax positions of $579 million, $515 million, and $688 million, respectively, net of income tax benefits.the aggregate changes in the gross unrecognized tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions were as follows: \u00a0   \u00a0 we settled a portion of the internal revenue service (\u201cirs\u201d) audit for tax years 2004 to 2006 in fiscal year 2011. in february 2012, the irs withdrew its 2011 revenue agents report related to unresolved issues for tax years 2004 to 2006 and reopened the audit phase of the examination. we also settled a portion of the irs audit for tax years 2007 to 2009 in fiscal year 2016, and a portion of the irs audit for tax years 2010 to 2013 in fiscal year 2018. we remain under audit for tax years 2004 to 2013.  in april 2020, the irs commenced the audit for tax years 2014 to 2017.as of june 30, 2020, the primary unresolved issues for the irs audits relate to transfer pricing, which could have a material impact in our consolidated financial statements when the matters are resolved. we believe our allowances for income tax contingencies are adequate. we have not received a proposed assessment for the unresolved issues and do not expect a final resolution of these issues in the next 12 months.\u00a0based on the information currently available, we do not anticipate a significant increase or decrease to our tax contingencies for these issues within the next 12 months. we are subject to income tax in many jurisdictions outside the u.s. our operations in certain jurisdictions remain subject to examination for tax years 1996 to 2019, some of which are currently under audit by local tax authorities. the resolution of each of these audits is not expected to be material to our consolidated financial statements. \u00a0 \u00a0 note 13 \u2014 unearned revenue  unearned revenue by segment was as follows:  \u00a0   \u00a0 changes in unearned revenue were as follows: \u00a0   \u00a0 82part ii item 8 \u00a0 revenue allocated to remaining performance obligations, which includes unearned revenue and amounts that will be invoiced and recognized as revenue in future periods, was $111 billion as of june 30, 2020, of which $107 billion is related to the commercial portion of revenue. we expect to recognize approximately 50% of this revenue over the next 12 months and the remainder thereafter.note 14\u00a0\u2014\u00a0leases  we have operating and finance leases for datacenters, corporate offices, research and development facilities, retail stores, and certain equipment. our leases have remaining lease terms of 1 year to 20 years, some of which include options to extend the leases for up to 5 years, and some of which include options to terminate the leases within 1 year. the components of lease expense were as follows: \u00a0   \u00a0 \u00a0 supplemental cash flow information related to leases was as follows: \u00a0   \u00a0 83part ii item 8 \u00a0 supplemental balance sheet information related to leases was as follows: \u00a0   \u00a0 maturities of lease liabilities were as follows: \u00a0   \u00a0 as of june 30, 2020, we have additional operating and finance leases, primarily for datacenters, that have not yet commenced of $3.4 billion and $3.5 billion, respectively. these operating and finance leases will commence between fiscal year 2021 and fiscal year 2023 with lease terms of 1 year to 16 years.during fiscal year 2020, we recorded an impairment charge of $161 million to operating lease right-of-use assets due to the closing of our microsoft store physical locations. \u00a0 84part ii item 8 \u00a0 note 15 \u2014 contingencies patent and intellectual property claims  there were 64 patent infringement cases pending against microsoft as of june 30, 2020, none of which are material individually or in aggregate.  antitrust, unfair competition, and overcharge class actions  antitrust and unfair competition class action lawsuits were filed against us in british columbia, ontario, and quebec, canada. all three have been certified on behalf of canadian indirect purchasers who acquired licenses for microsoft operating system software and/or productivity application software between 1998 and 2010.  the trial of the british columbia action commenced in may 2016. following a mediation, the parties agreed to a global settlement of all three canadian actions, and submitted the proposed settlement agreement to the courts in all three jurisdictions for approval. the final settlement has been approved by the courts in british columbia, ontario, and quebec, and the claims administration process will commence once each court approves the form of notice to the class.  other antitrust litigation and claims  china state administration for industry and commerce investigation  in 2014, microsoft was informed that china\u2019s state agency for market regulation (\u201csamr\u201d) (formerly state administration for industry and commerce) had begun a formal investigation relating to china\u2019s anti-monopoly law, and the samr conducted onsite inspections of microsoft offices in beijing, shanghai, guangzhou, and chengdu. the samr has presented its preliminary views as to certain possible violations of china's anti-monopoly law, and discussions are expected to continue. product-related litigation   u.s. cell phone litigation  microsoft mobile oy, a subsidiary of microsoft, along with other handset manufacturers and network operators, is a defendant in 40 lawsuits filed in the superior court for the district of columbia by individual plaintiffs who allege that radio emissions from cellular handsets caused their brain tumors and other adverse health effects. we assumed responsibility for these claims in our agreement to acquire nokia\u2019s devices and services business and have been substituted for the nokia defendants. nine of these cases were filed in 2002 and are consolidated for certain pre-trial proceedings; the remaining cases are stayed. in a separate 2009 decision, the court of appeals for the district of columbia held that adverse health effect claims arising from the use of cellular handsets that operate within the u.s. federal communications commission radio frequency emission guidelines (\u201cfcc guidelines\u201d) are pre-empted by federal law. the plaintiffs allege that their handsets either operated outside the fcc guidelines or were manufactured before the fcc guidelines went into effect. the lawsuits also allege an industry-wide conspiracy to manipulate the science and testing around emission guidelines. in 2013, the defendants in the consolidated cases moved to exclude the plaintiffs\u2019 expert evidence of general causation on the basis of flawed scientific methodologies. in 2014, the trial court granted in part and denied in part the defendants\u2019 motion to exclude the plaintiffs\u2019 general causation experts. the defendants filed an interlocutory appeal to the district of columbia court of appeals challenging the standard for evaluating expert scientific evidence. in october 2016, the court of appeals issued its decision adopting the standard advocated by the defendants and remanding the cases to the trial court for further proceedings under that standard. the plaintiffs have filed supplemental expert evidence, portions of which the defendants have moved to strike. in august 2018, the trial court issued an order striking portions of the plaintiffs\u2019 expert reports. a hearing is expected to occur in the second quarter of fiscal year 2021.85part ii item 8 \u00a0 other contingencies  we also are subject to a variety of other claims and suits that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of our business. although management currently believes that resolving claims against us, individually or in aggregate, will not have a material adverse impact in our consolidated financial statements, these matters are subject to inherent uncertainties and management\u2019s view of these matters may change in the future.  as of june 30, 2020, we accrued aggregate legal liabilities of $306 million. while we intend to defend these matters vigorously, adverse outcomes that we estimate could reach approximately $500 million in aggregate beyond recorded amounts are reasonably possible. were unfavorable final outcomes to occur, there exists the possibility of a material adverse impact in our consolidated financial statements for the period in which the effects become reasonably estimable. note 16\u00a0\u2014\u00a0stockholders\u2019 equity  shares outstanding  shares of common stock

the integrated structure of our business, certain revenue recognized and costs incurred by one segment may benefit other segments. revenue from certain contracts is allocated among the segments based on the relative value of the underlying products and services, which can include allocation based on actual prices charged, prices when sold separately, or estimated costs plus a profit margin. cost of revenue is allocated in certain cases based on a relative revenue methodology. operating expenses that are allocated primarily include those relating to marketing of products and services from which multiple segments benefit and are generally allocated based on relative gross margin. in addition, certain costs incurred at a corporate level that are identifiable and that benefit our segments are allocated to them. these allocated costs include costs of: legal, including settlements and fines; information technology; human resources; finance; excise taxes; field selling; shared facilities services; and customer service and support. each allocation is measured differently based on the specific facts and circumstances of the costs being allocated. certain corporate-level activity is not allocated to our segments. segment revenue and operating income were as follows during the periods presented: \u00a0   \u00a0 no sales to an individual customer or country other than the united states

remaining matters could have a material impact on the company's financial statements.  conclusions on recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions involve significant estimates and management judgment and include complex considerations of the internal revenue code, related regulations, tax case laws, and prior-year audit settlements. given the complexity and the subjective nature of the transfer pricing issues that remain unresolved with the irs, evaluating management's estimates relating to their determination of uncertain tax positions required extensive audit effort and a high degree of auditor judgment, including involvement of our tax specialists. how the critical audit matter was addressed in the audit our principal audit procedures to evaluate management's estimates of uncertain tax positions related to unresolved transfer pricing issues included the following:           \u00a0 /s/ deloitte\u00a0& touche llp \u00a0 seattle, washington\u00a0\u00a0 july 30,

company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements

recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. \u00a0 /s/ deloitte\u00a0& touche llp \u00a0 seattle, washington\u00a0\u00a0 july 30, 2020\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 98",

"table of contents \u00a0part i\u00a0  item 1a  \u00a0  pressures may result in decreased sales volumes, price reductions, and/or increased operating costs, such as for marketing and sales incentives, resulting in lower revenue, gross margins and operating income.  we may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property rights.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0protecting our global intellectual property rights and combating unlicensed copying and use of software and other intellectual property is difficult. while piracy adversely affects u.s. revenue, the impact on revenue from outside the u.s. is more significant, particularly in countries where laws are less protective of intellectual property rights. similarly, the absence of harmonized patent laws makes it more difficult to ensure consistent respect for patent rights. throughout the world, we actively educate consumers about the benefits of licensing genuine products and obtaining indemnification benefits for intellectual property risks, and we educate lawmakers about the advantages of a business climate where intellectual property rights are protected. however, continued educational and enforcement efforts may fail to enhance revenue. reductions in the legal protection for software intellectual property rights or additional compliance burdens could both adversely affect revenue.  third parties may claim we infringe their intellectual property rights.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0from time to time we receive notices from others claiming we infringe their intellectual property rights. the number of these claims may grow. to resolve these claims we may enter into royalty and licensing agreements on less favorable terms, stop selling or redesign affected products, or pay damages to satisfy indemnification commitments with our customers. such agreements may cause operating margins to decline. we have made and expect to continue making significant expenditures to settle claims related to the use of technology and intellectual property rights as part of our strategy to manage this risk.  we may not be able to protect our source code from copying if there is an unauthorized disclosure of source code.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0source code, the detailed program commands for our operating systems and other software programs, is critical to our business. although we license portions of our application and operating system source code to a number of licensees, we take significant measures to protect the secrecy of large portions of our source code. if an unauthorized disclosure of a significant portion of our source code occurs, we could potentially lose future trade secret protection for that source code. this could make it easier for third parties to compete with our products by copying functionality, which could adversely affect our revenue and operating margins. unauthorized disclosure of source code could also increase the security risks described in the next paragraph.  security vulnerabilities in our products could lead to reduced revenues or to liability claims.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0maintaining the security of computers and computer networks is a critical issue for us and our customers. hackers develop and deploy viruses, worms, and other malicious software programs that attack our products. although this is an industry-wide problem that affects computers across all platforms, it affects our products in particular because hackers tend to focus their efforts on the most popular operating systems and programs and we expect them to continue to do so. we devote significant resources to address security vulnerabilities through:  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 the cost of these steps could reduce our operating margins. despite these efforts, actual or perceived security vulnerabilities in our products could lead some customers to seek to return products, to reduce or delay future purchases, or to use competing products. customers may also increase their expenditures on protecting their existing computer systems from attack, which could delay adoption of new technologies. any of these actions by customers could adversely affect our revenue. in addition, actual or perceived vulnerabilities may lead to claims against us. although our license agreements typically contain provisions that eliminate or limit our exposure to such liability, there is no assurance these provisions will be held effective under applicable laws and judicial decisions.  \u00a0 \u00a0   table of contents \u00a0part i\u00a0  item 1a  \u00a0 we are subject to government litigation and regulatory activity that affects how we design and market our products.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0as a leading global software maker, we receive close scrutiny from government agencies under u.s. and foreign competition laws. some jurisdictions also provide private rights of action for competitors or consumers to assert claims of anti-competitive conduct. for example, we have been involved in the following actions.  lawsuits brought by the u.s. department of justice, 18 states, and the district of columbia in two separate actions were resolved through a consent decree that took effect in november 2001 and a final judgment entered in november 2002. these proceedings imposed various constraints on our windows operating system businesses. these include limits on certain contracting practices, mandated disclosure of certain software program interfaces and protocols, and rights for computer manufacturers to limit the visibility of certain windows features in new pcs. some of these rules will expire in november 2007; others will stay in force until november 2009 or later. although we believe we are in full compliance with these rules, if we fail to comply with them, additional restrictions could be imposed on us that would adversely affect our business.  in march 2004, the european commission ordered us to create new versions of windows that do not include certain multimedia technologies to provide our competitors with specifications for how to implement certain proprietary windows communications protocols in their own products. the design of these special versions of windows and the terms on which we make our protocol technology available are closely regulated by the commission. the product design aspect of the commission decision may limit our ability to innovate in windows in the future, diminish the developer appeal of the windows platform and increase our product development costs. the availability of protocol licenses may enable competitors to develop software products that better mimic the functionality of microsoft\u0092s own products which could result in a reduction in sales of our products. pending resolution of microsoft\u0092s appeal, there will remain uncertainty about the legal principles that govern product design and intellectual properties for future releases of microsoft products in europe.  in february 2006, the korean fair trade commission (\u0093kftc\u0094) issued a decision requiring us to offer two versions of windows pc operating systems, one with windows media player and instant messaging software removed and another with those functionalities included but also including promotional links to competing software products. if upheld on appeal, these remedies could adversely affect the utility and competitive position of windows pc operating systems in korea.  government regulatory actions and court decisions may hinder our ability to provide the benefits of our software to consumers and businesses, thereby reducing the attractiveness of our products and the revenues that come from them. new legal actions could be initiated at any time, either by these or other governments or private claimants including with respect to new versions of windows or other microsoft products. the outcome of such legal actions could adversely affect us in a variety of ways, including:  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 our software and services online offerings are subject to government regulation of the internet domestically and internationally in many areas including user privacy, telecommunications, data protection, and online content. the application of these laws and regulations to our business is often unclear and sometimes may conflict. compliance with these regulations may involve significant costs or require changes in business practices that result in reduced revenue. noncompliance could result in penalties being imposed on us or orders that we stop doing the alleged noncompliant activity.  our business depends largely on our ability to attract and retain talented employees.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0our business is based on successfully attracting and retaining talented employees. the market for highly skilled workers and leaders in our   \u00a0 \u00a0  table of contents \u00a0part i\u00a0  item 1a  \u00a0  industry is extremely competitive. we are limited in our ability to recruit internationally by restrictive domestic immigration laws. if we are less successful in our recruiting efforts, or if we are unable to retain key employees, our ability to develop and deliver successful products and services may be adversely affected. effective succession planning is also important to our long-term success. failure to ensure effective transfer of knowledge and smooth transitions involving key employees could hinder our strategic planning and execution.  delays in product development schedules may adversely affect our revenues.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0the development of software products is a complex and time-consuming process. new products and enhancements to existing products can require long development and testing periods. significant delays in new product releases or significant problems in creating new products could adversely affect our revenue.  we make significant investments in new products and services that may not be profitable.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0we have made and will continue to make significant investments in research, development, and marketing for new products, services, and technologies, including windows vista, the 2007 microsoft office system, xbox 360, live search, windows server, zune, and windows live. investments in new technology are inherently speculative. commercial success depends on many factors including innovativeness, developer support, and effective distribution and marketing. we may not achieve significant revenue from new product and service investments for a number of years, if at all. moreover, new products and services may not be profitable, and even if they are profitable, operating margins for new products and businesses may not be as high as the margins we have experienced historically.  adverse economic conditions may harm our business.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0inflation, softness in corporate information technology spending, or other changes in general economic conditions that affect demand for computer hardware or software could adversely affect our revenue or our investment portfolio. if overall market demand for pcs, servers, and other computing devices declines significantly, or consumer or corporate spending for such products declines, our revenue will be adversely affected. in addition, our revenue would be unfavorably impacted if customers reduce their purchases of new software products or upgrades because new offerings such as windows vista and the 2007 microsoft office system are not perceived as providing significant new functionality or other value to prospective purchasers.  we have claims and lawsuits against us that may result in adverse outcomes.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0we are subject to a variety of claims and lawsuits. adverse outcomes in some or all of the claims pending against us may result in significant monetary damages or injunctive relief against us that could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business. although management currently believes that resolving all of these matters, individually or in the aggregate, will not have a material adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows, the litigation and other claims are subject to inherent uncertainties and management\u0092s view of these matters may change in the future. there exists the possibility of a material adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows for the period in which the effect of an unfavorable final outcome becomes probable and reasonably estimable.  we may have additional tax liabilities.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0we are subject to income taxes in both the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions. significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes. in the ordinary course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. we are regularly under audit by tax authorities. although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals. the results of an audit or litigation could have a material effect on our income tax provision, net income or cash flows in the period or periods for which that determination is made.  our consumer hardware products may experience quality or supply problems.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0our hardware products such as the xbox 360 console are highly complex and can have defects in design, manufacture or associated software. we could incur significant expenses, lost revenue, and reputational harm if we fail to detect or effectively address such issues through design, testing or warranty repairs.  we obtain some components of our hardware devices from sole suppliers. if a component delivery from a sole-source supplier is delayed or becomes unavailable or industry shortages occur, we may be unable to obtain replacement supplies on a timely basis, resulting in reduced sales. either component shortages or excess inventory may require us to record charges to cost of revenue. xbox 360 consoles are assembled in asia; disruptions in the supply chain may result in console shortages that would affect our revenues and operating margins.  \u00a0 \u00a0   table of contents \u00a0part i\u00a0  item 1a, 1b  \u00a0 if our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets become impaired we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0under generally accepted accounting principles, we review our amortizable intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually. factors that may be considered a change in circumstances indicating that the carrying value of our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets may not be recoverable include a decline in stock price and market capitalization, reduced future cash flow estimates, and slower growth rates in our industry. we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings in our financial statements during the period in which any impairment of our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets is determined, negatively impacting our results of operations.  we operate a global business that exposes us to additional risks.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0we operate in over 100 countries and a significant part of our revenue comes from international sales. pressure to make our pricing structure uniform might require that we reduce the sales price of our software in the united states and other countries. operations outside the united states may be affected by changes in trade protection laws, policies and measures, and other regulatory requirements affecting trade and investment; changes in regulatory requirements for software; social, political, labor or economic conditions in a specific country or region; and difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations. although we hedge a portion of our international currency exposure, significant fluctuations in exchange rates between the u.s. dollar and foreign currencies may adversely affect our net revenues.  catastrophic events or geo-political conditions may disrupt our business.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0a disruption or failure of our systems or operations in the event of a major earthquake, weather event, cyber-attack, terrorist attack, or other catastrophic event could cause delays in completing sales, providing services or performing other mission-critical functions. our corporate headquarters, a significant portion of our research and development activities, and certain other critical business operations are located in the seattle, washington area, and we have other business operations in the silicon valley area of california, both of which are near major earthquake faults. a catastrophic event that results in the destruction or disruption of any of our critical business or information technology systems could severely affect our ability to conduct normal business operations and, as a result, our operating results could be adversely affected. abrupt political change, terrorist activity, and armed conflict pose a risk of general economic disruption in affected countries or operating costs. these conditions may lend additional uncertainty to the timing and budget for technology investment decisions by our customers.  acquisitions and joint ventures may have an adverse effect on our business.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0we expect to continue making acquisitions or entering into joint ventures as part of our long-term business strategy. these transactions involve significant challenges and risks including that the transaction does not advance our business strategy, that we don\u0092t realize a satisfactory return on the investment we make, or that we experience difficulty in the integration of new employees, business systems, and technology, or diversion of management\u0092s attention from our other businesses. these factors could adversely affect our operating results or financial condition.  improper disclosure of personal data could result in liability and harm our reputation.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0we store and process significant amounts of personally identifiable information. it is possible that our security controls over personal data, our training of employees and vendors on data security, and other practices we follow may not prevent the improper disclosure of personally identifiable information. such disclosure could harm our reputation and subject us to liability under laws that protect personal data, resulting in increased costs or loss of revenue. our software products also enable our customers to store and process personal data. perceptions that our products do not adequately protect the privacy of personal information could inhibit sales of our products.  other risks that may affect our business.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0other factors that may affect our performance may include sales channel disruption, such as the bankruptcy of a major distributor, and our ability to implement operating cost structures that align with revenue growth.   item\u00a01b.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0unresolved staff comments  we have received no written comments regarding our periodic or current reports from the staff of the sec that were issued 180 days or more preceding the end of our fiscal year 2007 that remain unresolved.  \u00a0 \u00a0  table of contents \u00a0part ii\u00a0  item 7  \u00a0 software plus services.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0the ability to combine the power of desktop and server software with the reach of the internet represents an opportunity across every one of our businesses. we believe our software plus services approach will enable us to deliver new experiences to end users and new value to businesses.  expanding our presence on the desktop and

provides the foundation for our efforts to reach the five billion people around the globe who do not have access to pcs and digital technology today.  summary of results for fiscal years 2007, 2006, and 2005  \u00a0 fiscal year 2007 compared to fiscal year 2006  revenue growth was driven primarily by licensing of the 2007 microsoft office system and windows vista, increased revenue associated with sql server, windows server, and visual studio, and increased xbox 360 console sales. foreign currency exchange rates did not have a significant impact on consolidated revenue during the year.  operating income growth was driven primarily by the increased revenue and decreased costs for legal settlements and legal contingencies, partially offset by increased cost of revenue associated with xbox 360 and windows vista, increased osb data centers costs, and increased sales and marketing expenses. in july 2007, we expanded our global xbox 360 warranty coverage to three years from the date of purchase for a general hardware failure indicated by three flashing red lights. as a result, we recorded a $1.06 billion charge for anticipated costs under the warranty policy, inventory write-downs, and product returns. the increase in sales and marketing expenses was primarily driven by increased headcount-related costs and marketing costs related to recent product launches. headcount-related costs increased 15%, driven by a 10% increase in headcount over the past twelve months and an increase in salaries and benefits for existing headcount.  fiscal year 2006 compared to fiscal year 2005  revenue growth was driven primarily by growth in sql server following the launch of sql server 2005 in the second quarter of fiscal year 2006, windows server and other server applications, increased xbox revenue resulting from the xbox 360 launch in november 2005, growth in licensing of windows pc operating systems through oems, and increased licensing of office and other mbd software. foreign currency exchange rates did not have a significant impact on consolidated or operating segment revenue during the fiscal year.  operating income increased primarily reflecting the revenue increase and a decrease in costs for legal settlements and legal contingencies. these changes were partially offset by an increase in cost of revenue primarily related to xbox 360 and an increase in sales and marketing expenses primarily as a result of increased investments in partner marketing and product launch-related spending. headcount-related costs increased 7%, driven by an increase in salaries and benefits for existing headcount and a 16% growth in headcount.  fiscal year 2008 outlook  worldwide macroeconomic factors have a strong correlation to business and consumer demand for our software, services, games, and internet service offerings. we expect a broad continuation in the economic conditions and demand in fiscal year 2008. we also expect continued double digit revenue growth. given our product launches in the second half of fiscal year 2007, we expect revenue growth to be higher in the first half of fiscal year 2008 than in the second half. we estimate worldwide pc shipments will grow between 9% and 11%. we do not expect a significant   \u00a0 \u00a0   table of contents \u00a0part ii\u00a0  item 7  \u00a0  impact from changes in year-over-year foreign currency exchange rates in fiscal year 2008. we expect our operating income growth rate to exceed our revenue growth rate.  segment product revenue/operating income (loss)  in july 2006, we announced a change in our operating segments reflecting previously announced reorganizations. we have five operating segments: client, server and tools, the online services business, the microsoft business division, and the entertainment and devices division. prior fiscal year information has been recast to conform to the way we internally managed and monitored performance at the business group level in fiscal year 2007.  the revenue and operating income/(loss) amounts in this section are presented on a basis consistent with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles (\u0093gaap\u0094) and include certain reconciling items attributable to each of the segments. the segment information appearing in note 18 \u0096 segment information of the notes to financial statements (part ii, item\u00a08) is presented on a basis consistent with the company\u0092s internal management reporting, in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards (\u0093sfas\u0094) no.\u00a0131, disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information. certain corporate-level activity has been excluded from our segment operating results and is analyzed separately.  client  \u00a0 client offerings consist of premium edition and standard windows operating systems. premium offerings are those that include additional functionality and are sold at a price above our standard versions. premium offerings include windows xp professional, xp media center edition, xp tablet pc edition, vista business, vista home premium, and vista ultimate. standard windows operating systems include windows xp home and windows vista home basic. client revenue growth correlates with the growth of purchases of pcs from oems that pre-install versions of windows operating systems because the oem channel accounts for approximately 80% of total client revenue. the differences between unit growth rates and revenue growth rates from year to year are affected by changes in the mix of oem windows operating systems licensed with premium edition operating systems as a percentage of total oem windows operating systems licensed (\u0093oem premium mix\u0094), changes in the geographical mix, and changes in the channel mix of products sold by large, multi-national oems versus those sold by local and regional system builders.  fiscal year 2007 compared to fiscal year 2006  client revenue increased primarily reflecting licensing of windows vista. oem revenue increased $1.46 billion or 13% driven by 13% growth in oem license units while revenue from commercial and retail licensing of windows operating systems increased $422 million or 21%. during the year, the oem premium mix increased 16 percentage points to 68%. based on our estimates, total worldwide pc shipments from all sources grew 10% to 12% driven by demand in both emerging and mature markets.  client operating income increased reflecting the increased revenue and decreased research and development costs, partially offset by increased windows vista product costs and increased sales and marketing expenses for launch-related programs. the decrease in research and development costs reflects the capitalization of certain windows vista software development costs and completion of product development on windows vista. headcount-related costs decreased 3%, driven by a 1% decrease in headcount and a decrease in stock-based compensation expense.  fiscal year 2006 compared to fiscal year 2005  client revenue increased reflecting $1.18 billion or 12% growth in oem revenue driven by 17% growth in oem license units from increased pc unit shipments, partially offset by a $118 million or 6% decrease in revenue from commercial and retail licensing of windows operating systems. during the year, the oem premium mix increased two percentage points to 52%. oem revenue growth included an increase to revenue of $89 million resulting from the alignment of   \u00a0 \u00a0  table of contents \u00a0part ii\u00a0  item 7  \u00a0  our billings associated with oem distributors in our system builder channel with both industry standards and other microsoft channels.  client operating income increased reflecting the increase in oem revenue partially offset by a $224 million increase in sales and marketing expenses, excluding headcount-related costs, mainly driven by increased investments in partner marketing and windows vista pre-launch programs. headcount-related costs increased 6%, driven by a 13% increase in headcount primarily associated with windows vista and further investments in our sales and marketing organization, and an increase in salaries and benefits for existing headcount, partially offset by a decrease in stock-based compensation expense.  server and tools  \u00a0 server and tools offerings consist of server software licenses and client access licenses (\u0093cal\u0094) for windows server, microsoft sql server, and other server products. it also includes developer tools, training, certification, microsoft press, premier and professional product support services, and microsoft consulting services. server and tools concentrates on licensing products, applications, tools, content, and services that make information technology professionals and developers more productive and efficient. the segment uses multiple channels for licensing including pre-installed oem versions, licenses through partners, and licenses directly to end customers. we sell licenses both as one-time licenses and as multi-year volume licenses.  fiscal year 2007 compared to fiscal year 2006  server and server application revenue (including cal revenue) and developer tools, training, and certification revenue increased $1.12 billion or 14%. this increase was primarily driven by increased revenue associated with sql server, windows server, and visual studio. the results reflect broad adoption of windows server products, especially sql server which grew over 20%. consulting, premier, and professional product support services revenue increased $404 million or 24% primarily due to higher demand for premier services in corporate enterprises. foreign currency exchange rates accounted for a $165 million or a two percentage point increase in revenue.  server and tools operating income increased reflecting the increased revenue, partially offset by growth in headcount-related costs and cost of revenue for services. headcount-related costs increased 12%, driven by an 11% increase in headcount and an increase in salaries and benefits for existing headcount, partially offset by a decrease in stock-based compensation expense. cost of revenue increased $243 million or 13% reflecting growth in services provided.  fiscal year 2006 compared to fiscal year 2005   server and tools revenue increased mainly driven by growth in sql server, windows server, and visual studio. sql server 2005 and visual studio 2005 were launched in the second quarter of fiscal year 2006 and produced revenue growth in these product lines. server and server applications revenue (including cal revenue) and developer tools, training and certification revenue increased $1.07 billion or 16% during fiscal year 2006. the results reflect broad adoption of windows server products, especially sql server, which grew over 30% for the year. consulting, premier and professional product support services revenue increased $217 million or 15% primarily due to higher demand for services.  server and tools operating income increased primarily reflecting the increased revenue, partially offset by increased sales and marketing expenses related to supporting long-term strategies and the launches of sql server 2005 and visual studio 2005. headcount-related costs increased 5%, driven by an 11% increase in headcount and an increase in salaries and benefits for existing headcount, partially offset by a decrease in stock-based compensation expense.  \u00a0 \u00a0   table of contents \u00a0part ii\u00a0  item 7  \u00a0 online services business  \u00a0 the online services business (\u0093osb\u0094) provides personal communications services, such as e-mail and instant messaging, online information offerings, such as live search, and the msn portals and channels around the world. osb also provides a variety of online services such as msn internet access, msn premium web services and onecare. we earn revenue primarily from online advertising, from consumers and partners through subscriptions and transactions generated from online paid services, and from msn narrowband internet access subscribers. we have transitioned to adcenter, our own platform, for online delivery of advertising in the u.s. and certain international markets. we continue to launch new online initiatives and expect to do so in the future. in fiscal year 2007, we launched windows live search and live.com in 54 international markets, live local search in the u.s. and u.k., beta versions of msn soapbox (our expansion of the msn video experience), virtual earth\u0099 3d, windows live hotmail, and other offerings.  fiscal year 2007 compared to fiscal year 2006  osb revenue increased driven primarily by advertising revenue which grew $314 million or 21% to $1.84 billion. this increase was primarily due to growth in advertising for search, home page, email, and messaging services. the increase in advertising revenue was partially offset by a $156 million or 31% decrease in access revenue. at june\u00a030, 2007, we estimate that osb had over 310\u00a0million active hotmail accounts and over 280\u00a0million messenger accounts.  osb operating loss increased driven primarily by increased cost of revenue which grew $352 million or 45% and increased headcount-related costs as a result of continued search and advertising platform investments. the increase in cost of revenue was primarily driven by increased data center costs, online content expenses, and royalties. headcount-related costs increased 30%, driven by a 12% increase in headcount and an increase in salaries and benefits for existing headcount.  fiscal year 2006 compared to fiscal year 2005  osb revenue decreased primarily reflecting a $195 million or 28% decline in access revenue, partially offset by a $126 million or 9% increase in advertising revenue and a $23 million or 9% increase in revenue from subscription and transaction services other than access. advertising revenue for fiscal year 2006 was $1.52 billion. the increase in advertising revenue reflects growth in display advertising for portals, channels, email, and messaging services, which was partially offset by a decline in search revenue due to the transition to adcenter. as of june\u00a030, 2006, osb had 2.1\u00a0million access subscribers compared with 2.7\u00a0million at june\u00a030, 2005. in addition, osb had over 261\u00a0million active hotmail accounts and over 243\u00a0million active messenger accounts as of june\u00a030, 2006.  osb operating income decreased due to a $230 million or 39% increase in research and development costs, a $126 million or 22% increase in sales and marketing expenses, and a $67 million or 9% increase in cost of revenue as we continued to invest in adcenter, windows live, and other new platforms. headcount-related costs increased 25%, reflecting a 44% increase in headcount and increased salaries and benefits for existing employees, partially offset by a decrease in stock-based compensation. \u00a0 \u00a0  table of contents \u00a0part ii\u00a0  item 7  \u00a0 microsoft business division  \u00a0 mbd offerings consist of the microsoft office system and microsoft dynamics business solutions.\u00a0microsoft office system products are designed to increase personal, team, and organization productivity through a range of programs, services, and software solutions. growth of revenue from the microsoft office system offerings, which generate over 90% of mbd revenue, depends on our ability to add value to the core office product set and to continue to expand our product offerings in other information worker areas such as enterprise content management, collaboration, unified communications, and business intelligence. microsoft dynamics products provide business solutions for financial management, customer relationship management, supply chain management, and analytics applications for small and mid-size businesses, large organizations, and divisions of global enterprises. we evaluate our results based upon the nature of the end user in two primary parts \u0096 business revenue which includes microsoft office system revenue generated through volume licensing agreements and microsoft dynamics revenue, and consumer revenue which includes revenue from retail packaged product sales, oem revenue, and sales of pre-installed versions of office in japan. fiscal year 2007 compared to fiscal year 2006  mbd revenue increased primarily reflecting licensing of the 2007 microsoft office system. revenue from consumer sales increased $371 million or 11% while revenue from business sales increased $1.54 billion or 14%. the increase in business revenue includes a 21% increase in microsoft dynamics customer billings. foreign currency exchange rates accounted for a $248 million or a two percentage point increase in revenue. mbd operating income increased reflecting the increased revenue, partially offset by increased sales and marketing expenses and cost of revenue primarily associated with the 2007 microsoft office system. the increase in sales and marketing expenses reflects increased headcount-related expenses, increased sales support costs from our enterprise software advisor channel partners, and increased launch-related marketing expenses. headcount-related costs increased 10%, driven by a 6% increase in headcount and an increase in salaries and benefits for existing headcount, partially offset by decreased stock-based compensation expense.  fiscal year 2006 compared to fiscal year 2005  mbd revenue increased reflecting an increase in business sales of $1.01 billion or 10%, partially offset by a decrease in consumer sales of $44 million or 1%. the increase in business sales reflects a 16% increase in microsoft dynamics customer billings.  mbd operating income increased reflecting the increased revenue partially offset by increased sales and marketing expenses related to supporting field sales efforts and increased research and development expenses. headcount-related costs increased 8%, driven by a 14% increase in headcount and an increase in salaries and benefits for existing headcount, partially offset by decreased stock-based compensation expense.  \u00a0 \u00a0   table of contents \u00a0part ii\u00a0  item 7  \u00a0 entertainment and devices division  \u00a0 the entertainment and devices division (\u0093edd\u0094) products include the xbox video game system; pc games; consumer software and hardware products; the zune digital music and entertainment device; mediaroom, our internet protocol television software; and mobile and embedded devices (windows mobile software platform, windows embedded device operating system and windows automotive). the success of video game consoles is determined by console innovation and quality, the portfolio of video game content for the console, online offerings, and the market share of the console. we believe that the functionality of the xbox 360 console, games portfolio, and online offerings are well-positioned relative to recently launched competitive consoles.  fiscal year 2007 compared to fiscal year 2006  edd revenue increased primarily due to increased xbox 360 console sales, zune sales, and increased xbox accessories and video game sales. we shipped 6.6\u00a0million xbox 360 consoles during fiscal year 2007 as compared to 5.0\u00a0million consoles during fiscal year 2006. xbox and pc game revenue increased $650 million or 19% as a result of increased xbox 360 platform sales, partially offset by decreased sales of the first generation xbox console and related accessories and video games. zune, which was launched in november 2006, consumer hardware and software, and tv platforms revenue increased $539 million or 65%. mobile and embedded devices revenue increased $138 million or 28% driven by sales growth in windows mobile software and windows embedded operating systems.  edd operating loss increased primarily due to the $1.06 billion xbox 360 charge recognized in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2007 and zune launch-related expenses. the increase in operating loss was partially offset by increased xbox 360 platform sales and decreased xbox 360 console manufacturing costs. headcount-related costs increased 15%, driven by a 9% increase in headcount and an increase in salaries and benefits for existing headcount, partially offset by a decrease in stock-based compensation expense.  fiscal year 2006 compared to fiscal year 2005  edd revenue increased primarily due to the launch of the xbox 360 console in november 2005, partially offset by a decline in first party xbox game sales primarily resulting from the significant impact of halo 2 in fiscal year 2005. the revenue growth was also attributable to $140 million or 15% growth from our other product lines, primarily as a result of an increase in pc games sales due to significant new game releases, especially \u0093age of empires iii\u0094, and an increase in tv platform revenue due to deployments in fiscal year 2006. mobile and embedded devices revenue increased $115 million or 44% driven by unit volume increases in major product lines, especially windows mobile software sales and windows embedded operating systems.  edd operating loss increased primarily as a result of a $1.64 billion increase in cost of revenue resulting from the number of xbox 360 consoles sold and higher xbox 360 unit costs, partially offset by the revenue growth. the significant impact of halo 2 in fiscal year 2005 also contributed to the increase in fiscal year 2006 operating loss. headcount-related costs increased 8%, driven by a 21% increase in headcount and an increase in salaries and benefits for existing headcount, partially offset by a decrease in stock-based compensation expense.  \u00a0  \u00a0  table of contents \u00a0part ii\u00a0  item 7  \u00a0 corporate-level activity  \u00a0 certain corporate-level results are not allocated to our segments. those results include expenses related to corporate operations associated with broad-based sales and marketing, product support services, human resources, legal, finance, information technology, corporate development and procurement activities, research and development and other costs, and legal settlements and contingencies.  fiscal year 2007 compared to fiscal year 2006  corporate-level expenses increased primarily driven by increased headcount-related costs offset by decreased costs for legal settlements and legal contingencies. headcount-related costs increased 25%, driven by a 19% increase in headcount and an increase in salaries and benefits for existing headcount. we incurred $511 million in legal charges during the twelve months ended june\u00a030, 2007, primarily related to antitrust and unfair competition consumer class actions, intellectual property claims, and an extension payment to sun microsystems, inc. under our limited patent covenant and standstill agreement. we incurred $1.32 billion in legal charges during fiscal year 2006 which included settlement expense of $361 million related to our settlement with realnetworks, inc. as well as other intellectual property and antitrust matters, a \u0080281\u00a0million ($351 million) fine imposed by the european commission in july 2006 related to its 2004 decision in its competition law investigation of microsoft, and an extension payment to sun microsystems, inc.  fiscal year 2006 compared to fiscal year 2005  corporate-level expenses decreased primarily reflecting decreased costs for legal settlements and legal contingencies partially offset by increased headcount-related costs. we incurred $1.32 billion in legal charges during fiscal year 2006 as compared to $2.31 billion in legal charges incurred during fiscal year 2005 primarily related to settlements with novell, inc., gateway, ibm, and other antitrust and competition law matters. headcount-related costs increased 5%, driven by a 23% increase in headcount and an increase in salaries and benefits for existing headcount, partially offset by a decrease in stock-based compensation.  outlook  our outlook for fiscal year 2008 is as follows:  client\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0we expect revenue to grow reflecting improvement in the commercial and retail portion of the business due to increased acceptance of windows vista. we expect pc shipments to grow 9% to 11% for fiscal year 2008. we believe that pc unit growth rates will be higher in the consumer segment than in the business segment and higher in emerging markets than in mature markets.  server and tools\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0we expect continued momentum from recent product launches and to benefit from the upcoming launches of the new versions of sql server, windows server, and visual studio in the second half of fiscal year 2008.  online services business\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0we expect increased growth in online advertising revenue as the portals, channels, and communications services continue to expand globally and the overall internet advertising industry continues to expand. in may 2007, we agreed to acquire aquantive, inc., a digital marketing company, for approximately $6 billion in cash. we expect to complete this transaction in august 2007. this acquisition will enable us to strengthen relationships with advertisers, agencies and publishers by enhancing our advertising platforms and services. the acquisition also provides us with increased depth in building and supporting next generation advertising solutions and environments such as cross media planning and video-on-demand.  microsoft business division\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0we expect revenue to continue to increase in fiscal year 2008 due to increased customer acceptance of the 2007 microsoft office system. we continue to develop plans to grow revenue in new areas such as unified communications, enterprise content management, collaboration tools, business intelligence, and through our existing portfolio of microsoft dynamics products.  \u00a0 \u00a0   table of contents \u00a0part ii\u00a0  item 7  \u00a0 entertainment and devices division\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0we expect revenue to increase due to the increased installed base of the xbox 360 console and from the release of halo 3, a new xbox 360 game. revenue from existing mobility and embedded devices is expected to increase due to unit volume increases of windows mobile software driven by increased market demand for phone-enabled devices and windows embedded operating systems.  operating expenses  cost of revenue  \u00a0 cost of revenue includes manufacturing and distribution costs for products sold and programs licensed, operating costs related to product support service centers and product distribution centers, costs incurred to support and maintain internet-based products and services, warranty costs, inventory write-downs, and costs associated with the delivery of consulting services. cost of revenue increased in fiscal year 2007 primarily driven by the xbox 360 charge, increased windows vista product costs, increased osb data center costs, and costs associated with the growth in consulting services. cost of revenue increased in fiscal year 2006 mainly due to a $1.64 billion increase in edd as a result of an increase in the number of total xbox consoles sold and higher xbox 360 unit costs.  research and development  \u00a0 research and development expenses include payroll, employee benefits, stock-based compensation expense, and other headcount-related costs associated with product development. research and development expenses also include third-party development and programming costs, localization costs incurred to translate software for international markets, and the amortization of purchased software code and services content. research and development costs increased during fiscal year 2007 primarily due to increased headcount-related costs which grew 8%, reflecting a 9% growth in headcount and an increase in salaries and benefits for existing headcount, partially offset by a decrease in stock-based compensation expense. research and development costs increased during fiscal year 2006 primarily due to increased development costs associated with upcoming offerings and corporate research activities. headcount-related costs increased 3% during fiscal year 2006, driven by a 17% increase in headcount and an increase in salaries and benefits for existing headcount, partially offset by a decrease in stock-based compensation expense.  \u00a0 \u00a0  table of contents \u00a0part ii\u00a0  item 7  \u00a0 sales and marketing  \u00a0 sales and marketing expenses include payroll, employee benefits, stock-based compensation expense, and other headcount-related costs associated with sales and marketing personnel and advertising, promotions, trade shows, seminars, and other programs. sales and marketing expenses increased during fiscal year 2007 primarily because of increased headcount-related costs and increased marketing costs related to recent product launches. headcount-related costs increased 22% during fiscal year 2007, driven by an 11% increase in headcount and an increase in salaries and benefits for existing headcount, partially offset by a decrease in stock-based compensation expense. sales and marketing expenses increased during fiscal year 2006 primarily because of increased headcount-related costs, investments in partner marketing and product launch-related spending. headcount-related costs increased 13% during fiscal year 2006, driven by a 20% increase in headcount and an increase in salaries and benefits for existing headcount, partially offset by a decrease in stock-based compensation expense.  general and administrative  \u00a0 general and administrative costs include payroll, employee benefits, stock-based compensation expense and other headcount-related costs associated with finance, legal, facilities, certain human resources, other administrative headcount, and legal and other administrative fees. general and administrative costs decreased during fiscal year 2007 primarily reflecting decreased costs for legal settlements and legal contingencies, partially offset by increased headcount-related costs. during fiscal year 2007, we incurred $511 million of legal charges primarily related to antitrust and unfair competition consumer class actions, intellectual property claims, and extension payment to sun microsystems, inc. as compared to $1.32 billion of legal charges in fiscal year 2006. headcount-related costs increased 15% during fiscal year 2007, driven by a 12% increase in headcount and an increase in salaries and benefits for existing headcount. general and administrative costs decreased in fiscal year 2006 primarily reflecting decreased costs for legal settlements and legal contingencies. during fiscal year 2006, we incurred $1.32 billion of legal charges primarily related to antitrust and unfair competition consumer class actions, intellectual property claims, and an extension payment to sun microsystems, inc. legal charges in fiscal year 2006 also included settlement expense of $361 million related to our settlement with realnetworks, inc. and the \u0080281\u00a0million ($351 million) european commission fine. headcount-related costs increased 7% during fiscal year 2006, driven by an 18% increase in headcount and an increase in salaries for existing headcount. we incurred $2.31 billion in legal charges during fiscal year 2005.  \u00a0 \u00a0   table of contents \u00a0part ii\u00a0  item 7  \u00a0 investment income and other  the components of investment income and other were as follows:  \u00a0 for fiscal year 2007, dividends and interest income declined, reflecting a decline in the average balance of dividend and interest-bearing investments, partly offset by higher interest rates received on our fixed-income investments. for fiscal year 2006, dividends and interest income increased due to higher interest rates received on our fixed-income investments, partially offset by a decline in the average balance of dividend and interest-bearing investments as a result of the $32.64 billion special dividend paid on december\u00a02, 2004, and stock repurchases made throughout fiscal year 2006.  for fiscal year 2007, net gains on investments increased primarily due to lower other-than-temporary impairments and gains on sales of fixed-income investments in the current period as compared to losses in fiscal year 2006, partly offset by fewer gains on the sale of equity investments. other-than-temporary impairments in fiscal year 2007 were not material and were $408 million in fiscal year 2006.\u00a0net gains on investments decreased in fiscal year 2006 primarily due to increased net losses on sales of fixed-income investments, higher other-than-temporary impairments, and fewer net gains on equity investments in fiscal year 2006 as compared to fiscal year 2005. for fiscal year 2006, other-than-temporary impairments were $408 million, as compared to $152 million in fiscal year 2005. the increase in other-than-temporary impairments in fiscal year 2006 was driven by planned sales of certain investments in an unrealized loss position in order to raise funds for the $20 billion tender offer announced on july\u00a020, 2006.  investments are considered to be impaired when a decline in fair value is judged to be other than temporary. we employ a systematic methodology that considers available evidence in evaluating potential impairment of our investments. if the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value, among other factors, we evaluate general market conditions, the duration and extent to which the fair value is less than cost, and our intent and ability to hold the investment. we also consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of and business outlook for the investee, including industry and sector performance, changes in technology, operational and financing cash flow factors, and rating agency actions. once a decline in fair value is determined to be other than temporary, an impairment charge is recorded and a new cost basis in the investment is established.  we lend certain fixed-income and equity securities to increase investment returns. the loaned securities continue to be carried as investments on our balance sheet. collateral and/or security interest is determined based upon the underlying security and the creditworthiness of the borrower. cash collateral is recorded as an asset with a corresponding liability. we anticipate that the magnitude of securities lent under this program will remain relatively consistent during the fiscal year.  we use derivative instruments to manage exposures to interest rates, equity prices, and foreign currency markets and to facilitate portfolio diversification. derivative losses during fiscal 2007 were primarily driven by net losses in time value on foreign currency contracts used to hedge anticipated foreign currency revenues. during fiscal year 2006, we experienced lower net losses on derivatives as compared to fiscal year 2005 primarily due to net gains on non-designated equity derivatives in fiscal 2006 as compared to net losses in fiscal 2005 and higher net gains on commodity positions in fiscal 2006 driven by increases in the related commodity indices. these gains were partially offset by higher net losses in time value on foreign exchange contracts used to hedge anticipated foreign currency revenues and higher net losses on interest rate derivative contracts in fiscal 2006. net derivative losses in fiscal year 2005 were primarily related to losses on equity derivatives, interest rate derivatives, and foreign currency contracts, partly offset by gains related to commodity positions used to provide portfolio diversification. gains and losses arising from derivatives not designated as accounting hedges are in large part economically offset by unrealized losses and gains, respectively, in the underlying securities which are recorded as a component of other comprehensive income. commodity derivatives are held for the purpose of portfolio diversification.  \u00a0 \u00a0  table of contents \u00a0part ii\u00a0  item 7  \u00a0 other, net in fiscal year 2006 includes $195 million of gains that resulted from the restructuring of joint venture relationships between microsoft and nbc related to msnbc cable l.l.c. and msnbc interactive news, l.l.c.  income taxes  our effective tax rate for fiscal years 2007, 2006, and 2005 was 30%, 31%, and 26%, respectively. the fiscal year 2007 rate reflects a recurring effective tax rate of 31% offset by a $195 million reduction resulting from various changes in tax positions taken in prior periods, related primarily to favorable developments in an irs position and multiple foreign audit assessments. during fiscal year 2006, we recorded a tax benefit of $108 million from the resolution of state audits and recorded a charge of \u0080281\u00a0million ($351 million) from the european commission fine which was not tax deductible. the 2005 tax rate was lower from the reversal of previously accrued taxes and from an irs settlement.  financial condition  cash and equivalents and short-term investments totaled $23.41 billion and $34.16 billion as of june\u00a030, 2007 and 2006, respectively. equity and other investments were $10.12 billion and $9.23 billion as of june\u00a030, 2007 and 2006, respectively. our investments consist primarily of fixed-income securities, diversified among industries and individual issuers. our investments are generally liquid and investment grade. the portfolio is invested predominantly in u.s.-dollar-denominated securities, but also includes foreign-denominated securities in order to diversify financial risk. as a result of the special dividend paid in the second quarter of fiscal year 2005 and shares repurchased, our retained deficit, including accumulated other comprehensive income, was $29.46 billion at june\u00a030, 2007. our retained deficit is not expected to impact our future ability to operate or pay dividends given our continuing profitability and strong cash and financial position.  unearned revenue   unearned revenue from volume licensing programs represents customer billings, paid either upfront or annually at the beginning of each billing coverage period, that are accounted for as subscriptions with revenue recognized ratably over the billing coverage period. for certain other licensing arrangements, revenue attributable to undelivered elements, including free post-delivery telephone support and the right to receive unspecified upgrades/enhancements of microsoft internet explorer on a when-and-if-available basis for windows xp and previous pc operating systems, is based on the sales price of those elements when sold separately and is recognized ratably on a straight-line basis over the life cycle of the related product. other unearned revenue includes services, microsoft dynamics business solution products, xbox live subscriptions, advertising, and tv platform for which we have been paid upfront and earn the revenue when we provide the service or software, or otherwise meet the revenue recognition criteria.  the following table outlines the expected recognition of unearned revenue as of june\u00a030, 2007:  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0   table of contents \u00a0part ii\u00a0  item 7  \u00a0 cash flows  fiscal year 2007 compared to fiscal year 2006  cash flow from operations increased $3.39 billion due to an increase in cash received from customers driven by 15% revenue growth, along with a $1.64 billion decrease in cash outflow for other current assets primarily reflecting changes in inventory. cash used for financing increased $3.98 billion. several events occurred during fiscal year 2007 that affected cash used for financing. we issued $6.78 billion of common stock, including $3.25 billion related to 113\u00a0million call options exercised by jpmorgan in december 2006. we also completed our tender offer on august\u00a017, 2006, which was included in the $27.58 billion of common stock repurchases. cash from investing decreased $1.91 billion due to a $3.49 billion decline in securities lending activity where cash collateral is received from the counterparty along with $1.19 billion spent on acquisitions of companies and additions to property and equipment. these impacts were partially offset by a $2.77 billion increase in net cash from combined investment purchases, sales, and maturities.  fiscal year 2006 compared to fiscal year 2005  cash flow from operations decreased $2.20 billion primarily due to increased payments to fund a $987 million increase in xbox 360 inventory and product costs and increased payments to employees resulting from a 16% growth in headcount. these factors were partially offset by increased cash receipts from customers driven by our 11% revenue growth and a $1.74 billion increase in unearned revenue. cash used in financing decreased $20.52 billion driven by a $32.57 billion reduction in cash dividend payments. this impact was partially offset by an $11.15 billion increase in common stock repurchases. net cash from investing decreased $7.02 billion driven primarily by an $8.93 billion decrease in cash from combined purchase, sales, and maturities of investments and a $766 million increase in additions to property and equipment. these factors were partially offset by $3.12 billion of net cash proceeds from our securities lending program.  we have no material long-term debt. stockholders\u0092 equity at june\u00a030, 2007, was $31.10 billion. we will continue to invest in sales, marketing, product support infrastructure, and existing and advanced areas of technology. additions to property and equipment will continue, including new facilities, data centers, and computer systems for research and development, sales and marketing, support, and administrative staff. commitments for constructing new buildings were $821 million on june\u00a030, 2007. we have operating leases for most u.s. and international sales and support offices and certain equipment under which we incurred rental expense totaling $326 million, $276 million, and $299 million in fiscal year 2007, 2006, and 2005, respectively. we have not engaged in any related party transactions or arrangements with unconsolidated entities or other persons that are reasonably likely to materially affect liquidity or the availability of requirements for capital resources. in may 2007, we announced that we had entered into an agreement to purchase aquantive, inc. for approximately $6 billion in cash. we expect to complete this transaction in august 2007.  during fiscal years 2007 and 2006, our board of directors declared the following dividends:  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  table of contents \u00a0part ii\u00a0  item 7  \u00a0 on july\u00a020, 2006, we announced the completion of the repurchase program initially approved by our board of directors on july\u00a020, 2004 to buy back up to $30.00 billion in microsoft common stock. during fiscal year 2006, we repurchased 754\u00a0million shares, or $19.75 billion, of our common stock under this plan. on july\u00a020, 2006, we announced that our board of directors authorized two new share repurchase programs: a $20.00 billion tender offer, which was completed on august\u00a017, 2006; and authorization for up to an additional $20.00 billion ongoing share repurchase program with an expiration of june\u00a030, 2011. under the tender offer, we repurchased approximately 155\u00a0million shares of common stock, or 1.5% of our common shares outstanding, for approximately $3.84 billion at a price per share of $24.75. on august\u00a018, 2006, we announced that the authorization for the $20.00 billion ongoing share repurchase program had been increased by approximately $16.16 billion. as a result, we are authorized to repurchase additional shares in an amount up to $36.16 billion through june\u00a030, 2011. as of june\u00a030, 2007, approximately $15.14 billion remained of the $36.16 billion approved repurchase amount.  we believe existing cash and equivalents and short-term investments, together with funds generated from operations, should be sufficient to meet operating requirements, regular quarterly dividends, and planned share repurchases. our philosophy regarding the maintenance of a balance sheet with a large component of cash and short-term investments, as well as equity and other investments, reflects our views on potential future capital requirements relating to research and development, creation and expansion of sales distribution channels, investments and acquisitions, share dilution management, legal risks, and challenges to our business model. we regularly assess our investment management approach in view of our current and potential future needs.  off-balance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations  we provide indemnifications of varying scope and amount to certain customers against claims of intellectual property infringement made by third parties arising from the use of our products. we evaluate estimated losses for such indemnifications under sfas no.\u00a05, accounting for contingencies, as interpreted by financial accounting standards board (\u0093fasb\u0094) interpretation no.\u00a045, guarantor\u0092s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees, including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others. we consider factors such as the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss. to date, we have not encountered material costs as a result of such obligations and have not accrued any material liabilities related to such indemnifications in our financial statements.  \u00a0 \u00a0   table of contents \u00a0part ii\u00a0  item 7  \u00a0 contractual obligations  the following table summarizes our outstanding contractual obligations as of june\u00a030, 2007:  \u00a0 \u00a0 in may 2007, we entered into an agreement and plan of merger with aquantive, inc. to acquire the company for approximately $6 billion in cash. as part of the agreement and plan of merger, we are required to pay $500 million if certain events occur that result in the merger not being completed. due to the nature of this obligation, this amount has not been accrued for or included in the above schedule. the acquisition is expected to be completed in august 2007.  recently issued accounting standards  in june 2006, the fasb issued interpretation no.\u00a048 (\u0093fin no.\u00a048\u0094), accounting for uncertainty in income taxes \u0096 an interpretation of fasb statement no.\u00a0109, which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise\u0092s financial statements in accordance with fasb statement no.\u00a0109, accounting for income taxes. the interpretation provides a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. under fin no.\u00a048, the company may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position should be measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. fin no.\u00a048 also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure, and transition. fin no.\u00a048 is effective for us beginning july\u00a01, 2007. based on our current assessment, the adoption of fin no.\u00a048 is expected to decrease beginning retained earnings by $200 million to $400 million upon adoption.  in june\u00a02006, the fasb ratified the emerging issues task force (\u0093eitf\u0094)\u00a0consensus on eitf issue no.\u00a006-2, \u0093accounting for sabbatical leave and other similar benefits pursuant to fasb statement no.\u00a043.\u0094 eitf issue no.\u00a006-2 requires companies to accrue the costs of compensated absences under a sabbatical or similar benefit   \u00a0 \u00a0  table of contents \u00a0part ii\u00a0  item 7  \u00a0  arrangement over the requisite service period. eitf issue no.\u00a006-2 is effective for us beginning july\u00a01, 2007. the cumulative effect of the application of this consensus on prior period results should be recognized through a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the year of adoption. elective retrospective application is also permitted. we do not expect the application of this consensus to have a material impact on our financial statements.  in fiscal year 2007, we adopted staff accounting bulletin (\u0093sab\u0094) no.\u00a0108, considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying current year misstatements. sab no.\u00a0108 requires companies to quantify misstatements using both a balance sheet (iron curtain) and an income statement (rollover) approach to evaluate whether either approach results in an error that is material in light of relevant quantitative and qualitative factors, and provides for a one-time cumulative effect transition adjustment. the adoption of sab no.\u00a0108 did not have an impact on our financial statements.  in september 2006, the fasb issued sfas no.\u00a0157, fair value measurements, which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. sfas no.\u00a0157 does not require any new fair value measurements, but provides guidance on how to measure fair value by providing a fair value hierarchy used to classify the source of the information. this statement is effective for us beginning july\u00a01, 2008. we currently are assessing the potential impact that adoption of sfas no.\u00a0157 would have on our financial statements.  in february 2007, the fasb issued sfas no.\u00a0159, the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities. sfas no.\u00a0159 gives us the irrevocable option to carry many financial assets and liabilities at fair values, with changes in fair value recognized in earnings. sfas no.\u00a0159 is effective for us beginning july\u00a01, 2008, although early adoption is permitted. we are currently assessing the potential impact that adoption of sfas no.\u00a0159 will have on our financial statements.  application of critical accounting policies  our financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with u.s. gaap. preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. these estimates and assumptions are affected by management\u0092s application of accounting policies. critical accounting policies for us include revenue recognition, impairment of investment securities, impairment of goodwill, accounting for research and development costs, accounting for legal contingencies, accounting for income taxes, and accounting for stock-based compensation.  we account for the licensing of software in accordance with american institute of certified public accountants statement of position (\u0093sop\u0094) 97-2, software revenue recognition. the application of sop 97-2 requires judgment, including whether a software arrangement includes multiple elements, and if so, whether vendor-specific objective evidence (\u0093vsoe\u0094) of fair value exists for those elements. for some of our products, customers receive certain elements of our products over a period of time. these elements include free post-delivery telephone support and the right to receive unspecified upgrades/enhancements of microsoft internet explorer on a when-and-if-available basis. the fair value of these elements is recognized over the estimated life cycle for the windows xp and previous pc operating systems. for windows vista, there are no significant undelivered elements and accordingly, no license revenue is deferred for windows vista sales. changes to the elements in a software arrangement, the ability to identify vsoe for those elements, the fair value of the respective elements, and changes to a product\u0092s estimated life cycle could materially impact the amount of earned and unearned revenue. judgment is also required to assess whether future releases of certain software represent new products or upgrades and enhancements to existing products.  sfas no.\u00a0115, accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities, and sab topic 5m, accounting for noncurrent marketable equity securities, provide guidance on determining when an investment is other-than-temporarily impaired. investments are reviewed quarterly for indicators of other-than-temporary impairment. this determination requires significant judgment. in making this judgment, we employ a systematic methodology quarterly that considers available quantitative and qualitative evidence in evaluating potential impairment of our investments. if the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value, we evaluate, among other factors, general market conditions, the duration and extent to which the fair value is less than cost, and our intent and ability to hold the investment. we also consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of and business outlook for the investee, including industry and sector performance, changes in technology, operational and financing cash flow factors, and rating agency actions. once a decline in fair value is determined to be other-than-temporary, an impairment charge is   \u00a0 \u00a0   table of contents \u00a0part ii\u00a0  item 7  \u00a0  recorded and a new cost basis in the investment is established. if market, industry, and/or investee conditions deteriorate, we may incur future impairments.  sfas no.\u00a0142, goodwill and other intangible assets, requires that goodwill be tested for impairment at the reporting unit level (operating segment or one level below an operating segment) on an annual basis (july 1 for us) and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. these events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate, legal factors, operating performance indicators, competition or sale or disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit. application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment, including the identification of reporting units, assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units, assignment of goodwill to reporting units, and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit. the fair value of each reporting unit is estimated using a discounted cash flow methodology. this requires significant judgments including estimation of future cash flows, which is dependent on internal forecasts, estimation of the long-term rate of growth for our business, the useful life over which cash flows will occur, and determination of our weighted average cost of capital. changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and/or goodwill impairment for each reporting unit. we allocate goodwill to reporting units based on the reporting unit expected to benefit from the combination. we evaluate our reporting units on an annual basis and, if necessary, reassign goodwill using a relative fair value allocation approach.  we account for research and development costs in accordance with applicable accounting pronouncements, including sfas no.\u00a02, accounting for research and development costs, and sfas no.\u00a086, accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold, leased, or otherwise marketed. sfas no.\u00a086 specifies that costs incurred internally in researching and developing a computer software product should be charged to expense until technological feasibility has been established for the product. once technological feasibility is established, all software costs should be capitalized until the product is available for general release to customers. judgment is required in determining when technological feasibility of a product is established. we have determined that technological feasibility for our software products is reached after all high-risk development issues have been resolved through coding and testing. this is generally shortly before the products are released to manufacturing. we determined that technological feasibility was reached with windows vista and the 2007 microsoft office system during the second quarter of fiscal year 2007 and accordingly, we capitalized approximately $120 million of software development costs. the amortization of these costs will be included in cost of revenue over the estimated life of the products. previously, costs incurred prior to technological feasibility were not material and were expensed as incurred.  the outcomes of legal proceedings and claims brought against us are subject to significant uncertainty. sfas no.\u00a05, accounting for contingencies, requires that an estimated loss from a loss contingency such as a legal proceeding or claim should be accrued by a charge to income if it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. disclosure of a contingency is required if there is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss has been incurred. in determining whether a loss should be accrued we evaluate, among other factors, the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss. changes in these factors could materially impact our results of operations, financial position, or our cash flows.  sfas no.\u00a0109, accounting for income taxes, establishes financial accounting and reporting standards for the effect of income taxes. the objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entity\u0092s financial statements or tax returns. judgment is required in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns. variations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could materially impact our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. accruals for tax contingencies are provided for in accordance with the requirements of sfas no.\u00a05.  we account for stock-based compensation in accordance with sfas no.\u00a0123(r), share-based payment. under the fair value recognition provisions of this statement, share-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period. determining the fair value of share-based awards at the grant date requires judgment, including estimating expected dividends. in addition, judgment is also required in estimating the amount of share-based awards that are expected to be forfeited.   \u00a0 \u00a0  table of contents \u00a0part ii\u00a0  item 7  \u00a0  if actual results differ significantly from these estimates, stock-based compensation expense and our results of operations could be materially impacted.  we account for product warranties in accordance with sfas no.\u00a05, accounting for contingencies. we provide for the estimated costs of hardware and software warranties at the time the related revenue is recognized. for hardware warranty, we estimate the costs based on historical and projected product failure rates, historical and projected repair costs, and knowledge of specific product failures (if any). the specific hardware warranty terms and conditions vary depending upon the product sold and country in which we do business, but generally include technical support, parts, and labor over a period generally ranging from 90\u00a0days to three years. for software, we estimate the costs to provide bug fixes, such as security patches, over the life of the software. we regularly reevaluate our estimates to assess the adequacy of the recorded warranty liabilities and adjust the amounts as necessary.  \u00a0 \u00a0   table of contents \u00a0part ii\u00a0  item 7  \u00a0 statement of management\u0092s responsibility for financial statements  management is responsible for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements and related information that are presented in this report. the consolidated financial statements, which include amounts based on management\u0092s estimates and judgments, have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america.  the company maintains accounting and internal control systems to provide reasonable assurance at reasonable cost that assets are safeguarded against loss from unauthorized use or disposition, and that the financial records are reliable for preparing financial statements and maintaining accountability for assets. these systems are augmented by written policies, an organizational structure providing division of responsibilities, careful selection and training of qualified personnel, and a program of internal audits.  the company engaged deloitte\u00a0& touche llp, independent auditors, to audit and render an opinion on the consolidated financial statements and management\u0092s report on its assessment and the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board (united states).  the board of directors, through its audit committee, consisting solely of independent directors of the company, meets periodically with management, internal auditors and our independent auditors to ensure that each is meeting its responsibilities and to discuss matters concerning internal controls and financial reporting. deloitte\u00a0& touche llp and the internal auditors each have full and free access to the audit committee.  \u00a0 \u00a0  table of contents \u00a0part ii\u00a0  item 7a  \u00a0  item\u00a07a.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk  we are exposed to foreign currency, interest rate, fixed-income, equity, and commodity price risks. a portion of these risks is hedged, but fluctuations could impact our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows. we hedge a portion of anticipated revenue and accounts receivable exposure to foreign currency fluctuations, primarily with option contracts. we monitor our foreign currency exposures daily to maximize the overall effectiveness of our foreign currency hedge positions. principal currencies hedged include the euro, japanese yen, british pound, and canadian dollar. fixed-income securities and interest rate derivatives are subject primarily to interest rate risk. the portfolio is diversified and structured to minimize credit risk. securities held in our equity and other investments portfolio and equity derivatives are subject to price risk, and are generally not hedged. however, we use put-call collars to hedge our price risk on certain equity securities that are held primarily for strategic purposes. commodity derivatives held for the purpose of portfolio diversification are subject to commodity price risk.  we use a value-at-risk (\u0093var\u0094) model to estimate and quantify our market risks. var is the expected loss, for a given confidence level, in fair value of our portfolio due to adverse market movements over a defined time horizon. the var model is not intended to represent actual losses in fair value, but is used as a risk estimation and management tool. the model used for currencies, equities, and commodities is geometric brownian motion, which allows incorporation of optionality with regard to these risk exposures. for interest rate risk, exposures such as key rate durations and spread durations are used in calculations that reflect the principle that fixed-income security prices revert to maturity value over time.  var is calculated by computing the exposures of each holding\u0092s market value to a range of over 1,000 equity, fixed-income, foreign exchange, and commodity risk factors. the exposures are then used to compute the parameters of a distribution of potential changes in the total market value of all holdings, taking into account the weighted historical volatilities of the different rates and prices and the weighted historical correlations among the different rates and prices. the var is then calculated as the total loss that will not be exceeded at the 97.5 percentile confidence level or, alternatively stated, the losses could exceed the var in 25 out of 1,000 cases. several risk factors are not captured in the model, including liquidity risk, operational risk, credit risk, and legal risk.  certain securities in our equity portfolio are held for strategic purposes. we hedge the value of a portion of these securities through the use of derivative contracts such as put-call collars. in these arrangements, we hedge a security\u0092s equity price risk below the purchased put strike and forgo most or all of the benefits of the security\u0092s appreciation above the sold call strike. we also hold equity securities for general investment return purposes. we have incurred material impairment charges related to these securities in previous periods.  the var amounts disclosed below are used as a risk management tool and reflect an estimate of potential reductions in fair value of our portfolio. losses in fair value over the specified holding period can exceed the reported var by significant amounts and can also accumulate over a longer time horizon than the specified holding period used in the var analysis. var amounts are not necessarily reflective of potential accounting losses, including determinations of other-than-temporary losses in fair value in accordance with u.s. gaap.  var numbers are shown separately for interest rate, currency rate, equity price, and commodity price risks. these var numbers include the underlying portfolio positions and related hedges. we use historical data to estimate var. given the reliance on historical data, var is most effective in estimating risk exposures in markets in which there are no fundamental changes or shifts in market conditions. an inherent limitation in var is that the distribution of past changes in market risk factors may not produce accurate predictions of future market risk.  the following table sets forth the one-day var for substantially all of our positions as of and for the years ended june\u00a030, 2007 and 2006:  \u00a0 total one-day var for the combined risk categories was $95 million at june\u00a030, 2007 and $158 million at june\u00a030, 2006. the total var is 39% less at june\u00a030, 2007, and 38% less at june\u00a030, 2006, than the sum of the separate risk categories in the above table due to the diversification benefit of the overall portfolio.  \u00a0 \u00a0   table of contents \u00a0part ii\u00a0  item 8  \u00a0 stockholders\u0092 equity statements  \u00a0 see accompanying notes.  \u00a0 \u00a0   table of contents \u00a0part ii\u00a0  item 8  \u00a0 notes to financial statements  note 1\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0accounting policies  accounting principles  the financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america.  principles of consolidation  the financial statements include the accounts of microsoft corporation and its subsidiaries. intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated. equity investments in which we exercise significant influence but do not control and are not the primary beneficiary are accounted for using the equity method. investments in which we are not able to exercise significant influence over the investee and which do not have readily determinable fair values are accounted for under the cost method.  estimates and assumptions  preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. examples include estimates of loss contingencies, product warranties, product life cycles, product returns, and stock-based compensation forfeiture rates; assumptions such as the elements comprising a software arrangement, including the distinction between upgrades/enhancements and new products; when technological feasibility is achieved for our products; the potential outcome of future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns; estimating the fair value and/or goodwill impairment for our reporting units; and determining when investment impairments are other-than-temporary. actual results and outcomes may differ from management\u0092s estimates and assumptions.  foreign currencies  assets and liabilities recorded in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rate on the balance sheet date. revenue and expenses are translated at average rates of exchange prevailing during the year. translation adjustments resulting from this process are charged or credited to other comprehensive income (\u0093oci\u0094).  revenue recognition  revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the fee is fixed or determinable, and collectibility is probable. we enter into certain arrangements where we are obligated to deliver multiple products and/or services (multiple elements). in these arrangements, we generally allocate the total revenue among the elements based on the sales price of each element when sold separately (vendor-specific objective evidence).  revenue for retail packaged products, products licensed to original equipment manufacturers (\u0093oem\u0094), and perpetual licenses for current products under our open and select volume licensing programs generally is recognized as products are shipped. a portion of the revenue related to certain products, which include all windows xp and previous pc operating systems, is recorded as unearned due to undelivered elements including, in some cases, free post-delivery telephone support and the right to receive unspecified upgrades/enhancements of microsoft internet explorer on a when-and-if-available basis. the amount of revenue allocated to undelivered elements is based on the vendor-specific objective evidence of fair value for those elements using the residual method. under the residual method, the total fair value of the undelivered elements, as indicated by vendor-specific objective evidence, is recorded as unearned, and the difference between the total arrangement fee and the amount recorded as unearned for the undelivered elements is recognized as revenue related to delivered elements. unearned revenue due to undelivered elements is recognized ratably on a straight-line basis over the related product\u0092s life cycle. revenue related to windows vista is not subject to a similar deferral because there are no significant undelivered elements.  revenue from multi-year licensing arrangements are accounted for as subscriptions, with billings recorded as unearned revenue and recognized as revenue ratably over the billing coverage period. certain multi-year licensing arrangements include rights to receive future versions of software product on a when-and-if-available basis under open and select volume licensing programs (software assurance). in addition, other multi-year licensing   \u00a0 \u00a0  table of contents \u00a0part ii\u00a0  item 8  \u00a0  arrangements include a perpetual license for current products combined with rights to receive future versions of software products on a when-and-if-available basis under open, select, and enterprise agreement volume licensing programs. premier support services agreements, msn internet access subscriptions, xbox live, and microsoft developer network subscriptions are also accounted for as subscriptions.  revenue related to our xbox game console and other hardware components is recognized upon shipment of the product to retailers. revenue related to games published by us is recognized when those games have been delivered to retailers. revenue related to games published by third parties for use on the xbox platform is recognized when manufactured for the game publishers. online advertising revenue is recognized as advertisements are displayed. search advertising revenue is recognized when the ad appears in the search results or when the action necessary to earn the revenue has been completed. consulting services revenue is recognized as services are rendered, generally based on the negotiated hourly rate in the consulting arrangement and the number of hours worked during the period. consulting revenue for fixed-price services arrangements is recognized based on percentage of completion.  costs related to insignificant obligations, which include telephone support for developer tools software, pc games, computer hardware, and xbox, are accrued when the related revenue is recognized. provisions are recorded for estimated returns, concessions, warranties, and bad debts.  cost of revenue  cost of revenue includes manufacturing and distribution costs for products sold and programs licensed, operating costs related to product support service centers and product distribution centers, costs incurred to support and maintain internet-based products and services, warranty costs, inventory write-downs, costs associated with the delivery of consulting services, and the amortization of capitalized research and development costs associated with software products that have reached technological feasibility.  research and development  research and development expenses include payroll, employee benefits, stock-based compensation, and other headcount-related costs associated with product development. we have determined that technological feasibility for our software products is reached shortly before the products are released to manufacturing. the amortization of these costs is included in cost of revenue over the estimated life of the products. we determined that technological feasibility was reached with windows vista and the 2007 microsoft office system during the second quarter of fiscal year 2007 and accordingly, we capitalized approximately $120 million of software development costs. previously, costs incurred prior to technological feasibility were not material and were expensed as incurred.  sales and marketing  sales and marketing expenses include payroll, employee benefits, stock-based compensation, and other headcount-related costs associated with sales and marketing personnel and advertising, promotions, tradeshows, seminars, and other marketing-related programs. advertising costs are expensed as incurred. advertising expense was $1.33 billion, $1.23 billion, and $995 million in fiscal years 2007, 2006, and 2005, respectively.  income taxes  income tax expense includes u.s. and international income taxes, plus the provision for u.s. taxes on undistributed earnings of international subsidiaries not deemed to be permanently invested. certain items of income and expense are not reported in tax returns and financial statements in the same year. the tax effect of such temporary differences is reported as deferred income taxes.  financial instruments  we consider all highly liquid interest-earning investments with a maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase to be cash equivalents. the fair value of these investments approximates their carrying value. in general, investments with original maturities of greater than three months and remaining maturities of less than one year are classified as short-term investments. investments with maturities beyond one year may be classified as short-term based on their highly liquid nature and because such marketable securities represent the investment of cash that is available for current operations. all cash equivalents and short-term investments are classified as available for sale and are recorded at market value using the specific identification method. changes in market value are reflected in oci (excluding other-than-temporary impairments).  \u00a0 \u00a0   table of contents \u00a0part ii\u00a0  item 8  \u00a0 equity and other investments may include both debt and equity instruments. debt securities and publicly traded equity securities are classified as available for sale and are recorded at market using the specific identification method. changes in market value are reflected in oci (excluding other-than-temporary impairments). all other investments, excluding those accounted for using the equity method, are recorded at cost.  we lend certain fixed-income and equity securities to enhance investment income. the loaned securities continue to be carried as investments on our balance sheet. collateral and/or security interest is determined based upon the underlying security and the creditworthiness of the borrower. cash collateral is recorded as an asset with a corresponding liability.  investments are considered to be impaired when a decline in fair value is judged to be other-than-temporary. we employ a systematic methodology on a quarterly basis that considers available quantitative and qualitative evidence in evaluating potential impairment of our investments. if the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value, we evaluate, among other factors, general market conditions, the duration and extent to which the fair value is less than cost, and our intent and ability to hold the investment. we also consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of and business outlook for the investee, including industry and sector performance, changes in technology, operational and financing cash flow factors, and rating agency actions. once a decline in fair value is determined to be other-than-temporary, an impairment charge is recorded and a new cost basis in the investment is established.  we use derivative instruments to manage exposures to foreign currency, equity price, interest rate and credit risks, to enhance returns, and to facilitate portfolio diversification. our objectives for holding derivatives include reducing, eliminating, and efficiently managing the economic impact of these exposures as effectively as possible. derivative instruments are recognized as either assets or liabilities and are measured at fair value. the accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation. for a derivative instrument designated as a fair-value hedge, the gain or loss is recognized in earnings in the period of change together with the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item attributed to the risk being hedged. for a derivative instrument designated as a cash-flow hedge, the effective portion of the derivative\u0092s gain or loss is initially reported as a component of oci and is subsequently recognized in earnings when the hedged exposure affects earnings. the ineffective portion of the gain or loss is recognized in earnings. for options designated either as fair-value or cash-flow hedges, changes in the time value are excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and are recognized in earnings. gains and losses from changes in fair values of derivatives that are not designated as hedges for accounting purposes are recognized in earnings.  foreign currency risk.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0certain assets, liabilities, and forecasted transactions are exposed to foreign currency risk. we monitor our foreign currency exposures daily to maximize the overall effectiveness of our foreign currency hedge positions. options are used to hedge a portion of forecasted international revenue for up to three years in the future and are designated as cash-flow hedging instruments under statement of financial accounting standards (\u0093sfas\u0094) no.\u00a0133, accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities. principal currencies hedged include the euro, japanese yen, british pound, and canadian dollar. certain non-u.s. dollar denominated securities are hedged using foreign exchange forward contracts that are designated as fair-value hedging instruments under sfas no.\u00a0133. certain options and forwards not designated as hedging instruments under sfas no.\u00a0133 are also used to hedge the impact of the variability in exchange rates on accounts receivable and collections denominated in certain foreign currencies and to manage other foreign currency exposures.  equities price risk.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0equity investments are subject to market price risk. from time to time, we use and designate options to hedge fair values on certain equity securities. we determine the security, selected for hedging by evaluating market conditions, up-front costs, and other relevant factors. certain options, futures and swap contracts, not designated as hedging instruments under sfas no.\u00a0133, are also used to manage equity exposures.  interest rate risk.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0fixed-income securities are subject to interest rate risk. the fixed-income portfolio is diversified and consists primarily of investment grade securities to minimize credit risk. we use exchange-traded option and futures contracts and over-the-counter swap contracts, not designated as hedging instruments under sfas no.\u00a0133, to hedge interest rate risk.  other derivatives.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0swap contracts, not designated as hedging instruments under sfas no.\u00a0133, are used to manage exposures to credit risks, enhance returns, and to facilitate portfolio diversification. in addition, we may invest in warrants to purchase securities of other companies as a strategic investment. warrants that can be net share settled are deemed derivative financial instruments and are not designated as hedging instruments. \u0093to be   \u00a0 \u00a0  table of contents \u00a0part ii\u00a0  item 8  \u00a0  announced\u0094 forward purchase commitments of mortgage-backed assets are also considered derivatives in cases where physical delivery of the assets in not taken at the earliest available delivery date. all derivative instruments not designated as hedging instruments are recorded at fair value, with changes in value recognized in earnings during the period of change.  allowance for doubtful accounts  the allowance for doubtful accounts reflects our best estimate of probable losses inherent in the accounts receivable balance. we determine the allowance based on known troubled accounts, historical experience, and other currently available evidence. activity in the allowance for doubtful accounts was as follows:  \u00a0 inventories  inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market, using the average cost method. cost includes materials, labor, and manufacturing overhead related to the purchase and production of inventories. we regularly review inventory quantities on hand, future purchase commitments with our suppliers, and the estimated utility of our inventory. if our review indicates a reduction in utility below carrying value, we reduce our inventory to a new cost basis.  property and equipment  property and equipment is stated at cost and depreciated using the straight-line method over the shorter of the estimated life of the asset or the lease term, ranging from one to 15 years. computer software developed or obtained for internal use is depreciated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the software, generally three years or less.  goodwill  goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis as of july\u00a01, and between annual tests if indicators of potential impairment exist, using a fair-value-based approach. no impairment of goodwill has been identified during any of the periods presented.  intangible assets  intangible assets are amortized using the straight-line method over their estimated period of benefit, ranging from one to ten years. we evaluate the recoverability of intangible assets periodically and take into account events or circumstances that warrant revised estimates of useful lives or that indicate that impairment exists. all of our intangible assets are subject to amortization. no material impairments of intangible assets have been identified during any of the periods presented.  product warranty  we provide for the estimated costs of hardware and software warranties at the time the related revenue is recognized. for hardware warranty, we estimate the costs based on historical and projected product failure rates, historical and projected repair costs, and knowledge of specific product failures (if any). the specific hardware warranty terms and conditions vary depending upon the product sold and country in which we do business, but generally include technical support, parts, and labor over a period generally ranging from 90\u00a0days to three years. for software, we estimate the costs to provide bug fixes, such as security patches, over the estimated life of the software. we regularly reevaluate our estimates to assess the adequacy of the recorded warranty liabilities and adjust the amounts as necessary.  \u00a0 \u00a0   table of contents \u00a0part ii\u00a0  item 8  \u00a0 recently issued accounting standards  in june 2006, the fasb issued interpretation no.\u00a048 (\u0093fin no.\u00a048\u0094), accounting for uncertainty in income taxes-an interpretation of fasb statement no.\u00a0109, which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise\u0092s financial statements in accordance with sfas no.\u00a0109, accounting for income taxes. the interpretation provides a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. under fin no.\u00a048, the company may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position should be measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. fin no.\u00a048 also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure, and transition. fin no.\u00a048 is effective for us beginning july\u00a01, 2007. based on our current assessment, the adoption of fin no.\u00a048 is expected to decrease beginning retained earnings by $200 million to $400 million upon adoption.  in june\u00a02006, the fasb ratified the emerging issues task force (\u0093eitf\u0094)\u00a0consensus on eitf issue no.\u00a006-2, \u0093accounting for sabbatical leave and other similar benefits pursuant to fasb statement no.\u00a043.\u0094 eitf issue no.\u00a006-2 requires companies to accrue the costs of compensated absences under a sabbatical or similar benefit arrangement over the requisite service period. eitf issue no.\u00a006-2 is effective for us beginning july\u00a01, 2007. the cumulative effect of the application of this consensus on prior period results should be recognized through a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the year of adoption. elective retrospective application is also permitted. we do not expect the application of this consensus to have a material impact on our financial statements.  in fiscal year 2007, we adopted staff accounting bulletin (\u0093sab\u0094) no.\u00a0108, considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying current year misstatements. sab no.\u00a0108 requires companies to quantify misstatements using both a balance sheet (iron curtain) and an income statement (rollover) approach to evaluate whether either approach results in an error that is material in light of relevant quantitative and qualitative factors, and provides for a one-time cumulative effect transition adjustment. the adoption of sab no.\u00a0108 did not have an impact on our financial statements.  in september 2006, the fasb issued sfas no.\u00a0157, fair value measurements, which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. sfas no.\u00a0157 does not require any new fair value measurements, but provides guidance on how to measure fair value by providing a fair value hierarchy used to classify the source of the information. this statement is effective for us beginning july\u00a01, 2008. we currently are assessing the potential impact that adoption of sfas no.\u00a0157 would have on our financial statements.  in february 2007, the fasb issued sfas no.\u00a0159, the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities. sfas no.\u00a0159 gives us the irrevocable option to carry many financial assets and liabilities at fair values, with changes in fair value recognized in earnings. sfas no.\u00a0159 is effective for us beginning july\u00a01, 2008, although early adoption is permitted. we are currently assessing the potential impact that adoption of sfas no.\u00a0159 will have on our financial statements.  note 2\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0unearned revenue  unearned revenue is comprised of the following items:  volume licensing programs \u0096 represents customer billings for multi-year licensing arrangements, paid either upfront or annually at the beginning of each billing coverage period, which are accounted for as subscriptions with revenue recognized ratably over the billing coverage period.  undelivered elements \u0096 represents free post-delivery telephone support and the right to receive unspecified upgrades/enhancements of microsoft internet explorer on a when-and-if-available basis. this revenue deferral is applicable for windows xp and previous pc operating systems shipped as retail packaged products, products licensed to original equipment manufacturers (\u0093oem\u0094), and perpetual licenses for current products under our open and select volume licensing programs. the amount recorded as unearned is based on the sales price of those elements when sold separately and is recognized ratably on a straight-line basis over the related product\u0092s life cycle. the percentage of revenue recorded as unearned due to undelivered elements ranges from approximately 15% to 25% of the sales price for windows xp home and approximately 5% to 15% of the sales price for windows xp   \u00a0 \u00a0  table of contents \u00a0part ii\u00a0  item 8  \u00a0  professional, depending on the terms and conditions of the license and prices of the elements. product life cycles are currently estimated at three and one-half years for windows operating systems.  other \u0096 represents payments for post-delivery support and consulting services to be performed in the future, online advertising for which the advertisement has yet to be displayed, microsoft dynamics business solutions maintenance and enhancement billings, xbox live and other billings that are accounted for as subscriptions, and other agreements where microsoft is committed to the delivery of future enhancements, products, or services.  the components of unearned revenue were as follows:  \u00a0 unearned revenue by segment was as follows:  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0   table of contents \u00a0part ii\u00a0  item 8  \u00a0 note

losses for less than and greater than 12 months and their related fair values were as follows:  \u00a0 at june\u00a030, 2007, unrealized losses of $186 million consisted of: $161 million related to investment grade fixed-income securities, $7 million related to investments in high yield and emerging market fixed-income securities, $7 million related to domestic equity securities, and $11 million related to international equity securities. at june\u00a030, 2006, unrealized losses of $243 million consisted of: $196 million related to investment grade fixed-income securities, $12 million related to investments in high yield and emerging market fixed-income securities, $2 million related to domestic equity securities, and $33 million related to international equity securities. unrealized losses from fixed-income securities are primarily attributable to changes in interest rates. unrealized losses from domestic and international equities are due to market price movements. management does not believe any unrealized losses represent an other-than-temporary impairment based on our evaluation of available evidence as of june\u00a030, 2007.  common and preferred stock and other investments that are restricted for more than one year or are not publicly traded are recorded at cost. at june\u00a030, 2007, the recorded basis and estimated fair value of these investments was $38 million. at june\u00a030, 2006, the recorded basis and estimated fair value of these investments was $41 million. the estimate of fair value is based on publicly available market information or other estimates determined by management.  \u00a0 \u00a0   table of contents \u00a0part ii\u00a0  item 8  \u00a0 the maturities of debt securities, including fixed-maturity securities, at june\u00a030, 2007 were as follows:  \u00a0 note 4\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0investment income and other  the components of investment income and other were as follows:  \u00a0 net gains on investments include other-than-temporary impairments. these were not material in fiscal year 2007, were $408 million in fiscal year 2006, and were $152 million in fiscal year 2005. the decrease in other-than-temporary impairments in fiscal year 2007 and the increase in fiscal year 2006 were driven by planned sales of certain investments in an unrealized loss position in order to raise funds for the $20 billion tender offer announced on july\u00a020, 2006. realized gains and losses from sales of available-for-sale securities (excluding other-than-temporary impairments) were $851 million and $176 million, respectively, in fiscal year 2007, $1.11 billion and $531 million, respectively, in fiscal year 2006, and $1.38 billion and $376 million, respectively, in fiscal year 2005.  note 5\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0derivatives  for derivative instruments designated as hedges, hedge ineffectiveness, determined in accordance with sfas no.\u00a0133, accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities, did not have a significant impact on earnings for fiscal years 2007, 2006, or 2005. during fiscal year 2007, $219 million in gains on fair value hedges from changes in time value and $361 million in losses on cash flow hedges from changes in time value were excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and included in investment income and other. during fiscal year 2006, $217 million in gains on fair value hedges from changes in time value and $399 million in losses on cash flow hedges from changes in time value were excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and included in investment income and other. during fiscal year 2005, $79 million in gains on fair value hedges from changes in time value and $116 million in losses on cash flow hedges from changes in time value were excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and included in investment income and other.  derivative gains and losses included in oci are reclassified into earnings at the time forecasted revenue or the sale of an equity investment is recognized. during fiscal year 2007, $168 million of derivative gains were reclassified to revenue. during fiscal year 2006, $166 million of derivative gains were reclassified to revenue and $23 million in derivative gains were reclassified to investment income and other. during fiscal year 2005, $57 million of derivative gains were reclassified to revenue and $33 million in derivative gains were reclassified to investment income and other.  we estimate that $124 million of net derivative gains included in oci will be reclassified into earnings within the next 12 months. no significant amounts of gains or losses were reclassified from oci into earnings as a result of forecasted transactions that failed to occur for fiscal years 2007, 2006, and 2005.  \u00a0 \u00a0  table of contents \u00a0part ii\u00a0  item 8  \u00a0 note 6\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0inventories  \u00a0 note 7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0property and

equipment and software range from two to three years, and furniture and equipment range from one to five years. land is not depreciated.  during fiscal years 2007, 2006, and 2005, depreciation expense was $1.17 billion, $863 million, and $723 million, respectively. the majority of depreciation expense in all years related to computer equipment.  note 8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0goodwill  changes in the carrying amount of goodwill for fiscal years 2007 and 2006 by segment were as follows:  \u00a0 we test goodwill for impairment annually on july\u00a01 at the reporting unit level using a fair value approach, in accordance with the provisions of sfas no.\u00a0142, goodwill and other intangible assets. our annual testing resulted in no impairments of goodwill in fiscal years 2007 and 2006. if an event occurs or circumstances change that would   \u00a0 \u00a0   table of contents \u00a0part ii\u00a0  item 8  \u00a0  more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its

primarily paid in cash:  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 as a result of these acquisitions, we recorded $983 million of goodwill, none of which is expected to be deductible for tax purposes. all of the entities were consolidated with microsoft since their respective acquisition dates. the purchase price allocations for these acquisitions are preliminary and subject to revision as more detailed analyses are completed and additional information about fair value of assets and liabilities becomes available. any change in the estimated fair value of the net assets of the acquired companies will change the amount of the purchase price allocable to goodwill. pro forma results of operations have not been presented because the effects of these acquisitions, individually and in aggregate, were not material.  note 9\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0intangible assets  the components of finite-lived intangible assets were as follows:  \u00a0 during fiscal year 2007 and 2006, we recorded additions to intangible assets of $473 million and $189 million, respectively. we estimate that we have no significant residual value related to our intangible assets. the components of finite-lived intangible assets acquired during fiscal years 2007 and 2006 were as follows:  \u00a0 intangible asset additions include $170 million of technology-based intangible assets with a weighted-average life of 4 years, and $84 million of other intangible assets with a weighted-average life of 4.9 years, related to the acquisitions of softricity inc., tellme networks, inc., and the remaining 11 entities acquired.  \u00a0

in tax positions taken in prior periods, related primarily to favorable developments in an irs position and multiple foreign audit assessments. the 2006 other reconciling item includes the impact of the $351 million non-deductible european commission fine. the 2005 other reconciling items include a $179 million repatriation tax benefit under the american jobs creation act of 2004.  the components of the deferred tax assets and liabilities were as follows:  \u00a0 deferred income tax balances reflect the effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases and are stated at enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when taxes are actually paid or recovered.  we have not provided deferred u.s. income taxes or foreign withholding taxes on temporary differences of approximately $6.10 billion resulting from earnings for certain non-u.s. subsidiaries which are permanently reinvested outside the united states. the amount of unrecognized deferred tax liability associated with these temporary differences is approximately $1.77 million.  the american jobs creation act of 2004 (the \u0093act\u0094) was enacted in october 2004. the act creates a temporary incentive for u.s. corporations to repatriate foreign subsidiary earnings by providing an elective 85% dividends received deduction for certain dividends from controlled foreign corporations. under these provisions, we repatriated approximately $780 million in dividends subject to the elective 85% dividends received deduction and we recorded a corresponding tax provision benefit of $179 million from the reversal of previously provided u.s. deferred tax liabilities on these unremitted foreign subsidiary earnings in 2005. the dividend was paid in june 2006.  income taxes paid were $5.24 billion in fiscal year 2007, $4.78 billion in fiscal year 2006, and $4.33 billion in fiscal year 2005.  tax contingencies.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0we are subject to income taxes in the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions. significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and recording the related assets and liabilities. in the ordinary course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. we are regularly under audit by tax authorities. accruals for tax contingencies are provided for in accordance with the requirements of sfas no.\u00a05, accounting for contingencies.  \u00a0 \u00a0  table of contents \u00a0part ii\u00a0  item 8  \u00a0 although we believe we have appropriate support for the positions taken on our tax returns, we have recorded a liability for our best estimate of the probable loss on certain of these positions, the non-current portion of which is included in other long-term liabilities. we believe that our accruals for tax liabilities are adequate for all open years, based on our assessment of many factors including past experience and interpretations of tax law applied to the facts of each matter, which matters result primarily from inter-company transfer pricing, restructuring of foreign operations, tax benefits from the foreign sales corporation and extra territorial income tax rules, the amount of research and experimentation tax credits claimed, state income taxes, and certain other matters. although we believe our recorded assets and liabilities are reasonable, tax regulations are subject to interpretation and tax litigation is inherently uncertain; therefore our assessments can involve both a series of complex judgments about future events and rely heavily on estimates and assumptions. although we believe that the estimates and assumptions supporting our assessments are reasonable, the final determination of tax audit settlements and any related litigation could be materially different than that which is reflected in historical income tax provisions and recorded assets and liabilities. if we were to settle an audit or a matter under litigation, it could have a material effect on our income tax provision, net income, or cash flows in the period or periods for which that determination is made. due to the complexity involved we are not able to estimate the range of reasonably possible losses in excess of amounts recorded.  the internal revenue service (\u0093irs\u0094) has completed and closed its audits of our consolidated federal income tax returns through 1999. the irs is currently conducting audits of our consolidated federal income tax return for tax years 2000 through 2006.  note 11\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0other long-term liabilities  \u00a0 note 12\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0stockholders\u0092 equity  shares of common stock outstanding were as follows:  \u00a0

and authorization for up to an additional $20.00 billion ongoing share repurchase program with an expiration of june\u00a030, 2011. under the tender offer, we repurchased approximately 155\u00a0million shares of common stock, or 1.5% of our common shares outstanding, for approximately $3.84 billion at a price per share of $24.75. on august\u00a018, 2006, we announced that the

share-based payment, using the modified prospective application transition method. because the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no.\u00a0123, stock-based compensation, and sfas no.\u00a0123(r) were materially consistent under our equity plans, the adoption of sfas no.\u00a0123(r) did not have a significant impact on our financial position or our results of operations. prior to our adoption of sfas no.\u00a0123(r), benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation costs were reported as operating cash flows. sfas no.\u00a0123(r) requires excess tax benefits be reported as a financing cash inflow rather than as a reduction of taxes paid.  the stock-based compensation and related income tax benefits were as follows:  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0   table of

canceled without delivery of shares generally become available for issuance under the plans. the options transferred to jpmorgan chase bank (\u0093jpmorgan\u0094) (see below) in fiscal year 2004 have been removed from our plans; the options transferred to jpmorgan that expired without being exercised are not available for grant under any of our plans. we issue new shares to satisfy stock option exercises.  on november\u00a09, 2004, our shareholders approved amendments to the stock plans that allowed our board of directors to adjust eligible options, unvested stock awards, and shared performance stock awards to maintain their pre-dividend value after the $3.00 special dividend. additional awards were granted for options, stock awards, and shared performance stock awards by the ratio of post- and pre-special dividend stock price as of the ex-dividend date. strike prices for options were decreased by the same ratio. stock-based compensation was not affected by this adjustment. as a result of this approval and payment of the $3.00 special dividend on december\u00a02, 2004, an adjustment to the prices and number of shares of existing awards was made resulting in a total of 96\u00a0million options and 7\u00a0million stock awards being issued to adjust the outstanding awards. in addition, the target shared performance stock awards were increased by 4\u00a0million shares.  stock awards and shared performance stock awards.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0stock awards are grants that entitle the holder to shares of common stock as the award vests. our stock awards generally vest over a five-year period.  shared performance stock awards (\u0093spsas\u0094) are a form of stock award in which the number of shares ultimately received depends on our business performance against specified performance targets. the performance period for spsas issued in fiscal years 2004, 2005, and 2006 was july\u00a01, 2003 through june\u00a030, 2006 (january\u00a01, 2004 through june\u00a030, 2006 for certain executive officers). following the end of the performance period, the compensation committee of the board of directors determined that the number of shares of stock awards to be issued was 37.0\u00a0million, based on the actual performance against metrics established for the performance period. one-third of the awards vested in fiscal year 2007. an additional one-third of the awards will vest over each of the following two years. because the spsas covered a three-year period, spsas issued in fiscal year 2005 and 2006 were given only to newly hired and promoted employees eligible to receive spsas.  the company granted spsas for fiscal year 2007 with a performance period of july\u00a01, 2006 through june\u00a030, 2007. at the end of the performance period, the number of shares of stock subject to the award is determined by multiplying the target award by a percentage ranging from 0% to 150%. the percentage is determined based on performance against metrics for the performance period, as determined by the compensation committee of the board of directors in its sole discretion. an additional 15% of the total stock and stock awards will be available as   \u00a0 \u00a0  table of contents \u00a0part ii\u00a0  item 8  \u00a0  additional awards to participants based on individual performance. one-quarter of the shares of stock subject to each award will vest following the end of the performance period, and an additional one-quarter of the shares will vest over each of the following three years.  we measure the fair value of sas and spsas based upon the market price of the underlying common stock as of the date of grant, reduced by the present value of estimated future dividends. sas and spsas are amortized over their applicable vesting period (generally three to five years) using the straight-line method. the fair value of each award grant is estimated on the date of grant using the following assumptions:  \u00a0 during fiscal year 2007, the following activity occurred under our existing plans:  \u00a0 as of june\u00a030, 2007, there were $2.22 billion and $392 million of total unrecognized compensation costs related to sas and spsas, respectively. these costs are expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 3.4 years and 2.1 years, respectively.  spsas granted in fiscal year 2007 include adjustments for estimated performance against performance targets.  during the 12 months ended june\u00a030, 2006 and june\u00a030, 2005, the following activity occurred under our plans:  \u00a0 stock options.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0in fiscal year 2004, we began granting employees stock awards rather than stock options as part of our equity compensation plans. since then, stock options issued to employees have been issued primarily in conjunction with business acquisitions. nonqualified stock options were granted to our directors under our non-employee director stock plan. nonqualified and incentive stock options were granted to our officers and employees under our employee stock plans. options granted between 1995 and 2001 generally vest over four and   \u00a0 \u00a0   table of contents \u00a0part ii\u00a0  item 8  \u00a0  one-half years and expire seven years from the date of grant, while certain options vest either over four and one-half years or over seven and one-half years and expire ten years from the date of grant. options granted after 2001 vest over four and one-half years and expire ten years from the date of grant. approximately 3\u00a0million stock options were granted in conjunction with business acquisitions during fiscal years 2007 and 2006, respectively. no stock options were granted during the year ended june\u00a030, 2005.  during fiscal year 2004, we completed an employee stock option transfer program whereby employees could elect to transfer all of their vested and unvested options with a strike price of $33.00 or higher to jpmorgan. the options transferred to jpmorgan were amended and restated upon transfer to contain terms and conditions typical of equity option transactions entered into between sophisticated financial counterparties at arm\u0092s length using standard terms and definitions for equity derivatives. as a result of this program, we recorded additional stock-based compensation expense of $2.21 billion ($1.48 billion after-tax or $0.14 per diluted share) which was recorded in the second quarter of fiscal year 2004. in december 2006, jp morgan chase bank (\u0093jpmorgan\u0094) exercised approximately 113\u00a0million call options for $3.25 billion at an average price per share of $28.80. the call options were among 345\u00a0million options acquired by jpmorgan in fiscal year 2004 through our employee stock option transfer program. the other approximately 232\u00a0million options expired unexercised.  employee stock options outstanding were as follows:  \u00a0 included in the options outstanding balance are approximately 5\u00a0million options that were granted in conjunction with business acquisitions. while these options are included in the options outstanding balance, they are excluded from the weighted average exercise prices presented. these options have an exercise price range of $0 to $150.93 and a weighted average exercise price of $10.35.  during fiscal years 2007, 2006, and 2005 the following activity occurred under our plans:  \u00a0 cash received and income tax benefits from stock option exercises were $6.35 billion and $286 million, respectively, for fiscal year 2007.  note 15\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0earnings per share  basic earnings per share is computed on the basis of the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. diluted earnings per share is computed on the basis of the weighted average number of shares of common stock plus the effect of dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period using   \u00a0 \u00a0  table of contents \u00a0part ii\u00a0  item 8  \u00a0  the treasury stock method. dilutive potential common shares include outstanding stock options, stock awards, and shared performance stock awards. the components of basic and diluted earnings per share are as follows:  \u00a0 \u00a0 for the years ended june\u00a030, 2007, 2006, and 2005, 199\u00a0million, 649\u00a0million, and 854\u00a0million shares, respectively, were attributable to outstanding stock options and were excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per share because the exercise prices of the stock options were greater than or equal to the average price of the common shares, and therefore their inclusion would have been anti-dilutive. for the year ended june\u00a030, 2007, 4\u00a0million shared performance stock awards, out of the 14\u00a0million targeted amount outstanding, have been excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per share because the number of shares ultimately issued is contingent on our performance against metrics established for the performance period, as discussed in note 14 \u0096 employee stock and savings plans.  note 16\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0commitments and guarantees  we have committed $821 million for constructing new buildings.  we have operating leases for most u.s. and international sales and support offices and certain equipment. rental expense for operating leases was $326 million, $276 million, and $299 million, in fiscal years 2007, 2006, and 2005, respectively. future minimum rental commitments under noncancellable leases are as follows:  \u00a0 in connection with various operating leases, we issued residual value guarantees, which provide that if we do not purchase the leased property from the lessor at the end of the lease term, then we are liable to the lessor for an amount equal to the shortage (if any) between the proceeds from the sale of the property and an agreed value. as of june\u00a030, 2006, the maximum amount of the residual value guarantees was approximately $271 million. during 2007, we exercised a provision in the operating lease agreements to purchase the outstanding portion of certain operating leases for approximately $41 million and are no longer subject to the residual value guarantees.  we provide indemnifications of varying scope and size to certain customers against claims of intellectual property infringement made by third parties arising from the use of our products. in addition, we also provide indemnification   \u00a0 \u00a0   table of contents \u00a0part ii\u00a0  item 8  \u00a0  against credit risk in several geographical locations to our volume license resellers in case the resellers fail to collect from the end user. due to the nature of the indemnification provided to our resellers, we cannot estimate the fair value, nor determine the total nominal amount of the indemnification. we evaluate estimated losses for such indemnifications under sfas no.\u00a05, accounting for contingencies, as interpreted by fin no.\u00a045, guarantor\u0092s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees, including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others. we consider such factors as the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss. to date, we have not encountered material costs as a result of such obligations and have not accrued any liabilities related to such indemnifications in our financial statements. we provide for the estimated costs of hardware and software warranties at the time the related revenue is recognized. for hardware warranty, we estimate the costs based on historical and projected product failure rates, historical and projected repair costs, and knowledge of specific product failures (if any). the specific hardware warranty terms and conditions vary depending upon the product sold and country in which we do business, but generally include technical support, parts, and labor over a period generally ranging from 90\u00a0days to three years. for software warranty, we estimate the costs to provide bug fixes, such as security patches, over the estimated life of the software. we regularly reevaluate our estimates to assess the adequacy of the recorded warranty liabilities and adjust the amounts as necessary.  in july 2007, we expanded our global xbox 360 warranty coverage to three years from the date of purchase for a general hardware failure indicated by three flashing red lights. the basic xbox 360 console warranty remains in place with a warranty period of one year from the date of purchase in most geographies.  the changes in our aggregate product warranty liabilities, which are included in other current liabilities and other long term-liabilities on our balance sheets, were as follows:  \u00a0 \u00a0 note 17\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0contingencies  government competition law matters.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0in march\u00a02004, the european commission issued a decision in its competition law investigation of us. the commission concluded that we infringed european competition law by refusing to license to our competitors certain protocol technology in the windows server operating systems and by including streaming media playback features in windows desktop operating systems. the commission ordered us to license the protocol technology to our competitors and to develop and make available a version of the windows desktop operating system that does not include specified media playback software. the commission also fined us \u0080497\u00a0million ($605 million). we appealed the decision to the court of first instance. in july 2006, the european commission determined that we had not complied with the technical documentation requirements of the 2004 decision, and fined us \u0080281\u00a0million ($351 million). we have appealed this fine to the court of first instance. we have expensed and paid both fines, pending resolution of the appeals. in march\u00a02007, the european commission announced a new statement of objections.\u00a0the new statement of objections claims that the pricing terms we proposed for licensing certain server protocol technology as required by\u00a0the march 2004 decision are \u0093not   \u00a0 \u00a0  table of contents \u00a0part ii\u00a0  item 8  \u00a0  reasonable.\u0094 the statement of objections\u00a0threatens to impose new fines of up to \u0080500,000 ($675,000) per day from december 2005 to june 2006, up to \u00802\u00a0million ($3\u00a0million) per day from june to july 2006, and up to \u00803\u00a0million ($4\u00a0million) per day beginning august 2006.\u00a0the maximum amount of the potential fine as of june\u00a030, 2007 is $1.58\u00a0billion.\u00a0we have submitted a written response to the statement of objections and are seeking to determine a reasonable royalty rate with the commission.  in december 2005, the korean fair trade commission (\u0093kftc\u0094) ruled that we abused a market dominant position and engaged in unfair trade practices under the korean fair trade act. the kftc stated we violated the act by building instant messaging and media player features into the windows pc operating system and streaming media technologies into the windows server operating system. the kftc imposed a fine of approximately $34 million which we have expensed and paid. the kftc\u0092s order issued in february 2006 held that our integration of these media and messaging features into the windows pc and server operating systems was an abuse of monopoly power and unlawful tying in violation of the korean fair trade act. the order required us to develop and distribute in korea versions of windows xp and its successors that do not include windows media player or windows messenger functionality. we also may distribute a second modified version of windows that contains the media and messenger features, as long as it includes promotional links to certain competing media players and instant messengers. we have appealed the kftc\u0092s decision to the seoul high court. in may\u00a02006, the kftc denied our motion for reconsideration of its ruling, but also dropped the element of its ruling that prohibited us from including media player or instant messaging functionality in any product other than the windows client operating system for which we have a 50% or greater market share. in other ongoing investigations, various foreign governments and several state attorneys general have requested information from us concerning competition, privacy, and security issues.  antitrust, unfair competition, and overcharge class actions.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0a large number of antitrust and unfair competition class action lawsuits have been filed against us in various state and federal courts on behalf of various classes of direct and indirect purchasers of our pc operating system and certain other software products. we obtained dismissals of damages claims of indirect purchasers under federal law and in 15 states. courts refused to certify classes in two additional states. we have reached agreements to settle all claims in 20 states.  under the settlements, generally class members can obtain vouchers that entitle them to be reimbursed for purchases of a wide variety of platform-neutral computer hardware and software. the total value of vouchers that we may issue varies by state. we will make available to certain schools a percentage of those vouchers that are not issued or claimed (one-half to two-thirds depending on the state). the total value of vouchers we ultimately issue will depend on the number of class members who make claims and are issued vouchers. the maximum value of vouchers to be issued is approximately $2.7 billion. the actual costs of these settlements will be less than that maximum amount, depending on the number of class members and schools that are issued and redeem vouchers.  the settlements in all states but iowa have received final court approval. settlements in arkansas and wisconsin received final court approval in march 2007. the iowa case settled in february 2007 and the court gave its preliminary approval of the settlement in april 2007. the cases in mississippi have not been settled. we estimate the total cost to resolve all of these cases will range between $1.7 billion and $1.9 billion. the actual cost depends on factors such as the quantity and mix of products for which claims will be made, the number of eligible class members who ultimately use the vouchers, the nature of hardware and software that is acquired using the vouchers, and the cost of administering the claims. at june\u00a030, 2007, we have recorded a liability related to these claims of approximately $1.2 billion, which reflects our estimated exposure of $1.7 billion less payments made to date of approximately $500 million, mostly for administrative expenses and legal fees.  other antitrust litigation and claims.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0in november 2004, novell, inc. filed a complaint in u.s. district court in utah, now consolidated with other cases in maryland, asserting antitrust and unfair competition claims against us related to novell\u0092s ownership of wordperfect and other productivity applications during the period between june 1994 and march 1996. in june\u00a02005, the trial court granted our motion to dismiss four of six claims of the complaint. an appeal of that ruling is now pending and the case is effectively stayed during the appeal.  patent and intellectual property claims.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0we are vigorously defending more than 45 patent infringement cases. in the case of eolas technologies, inc. and university of california v. microsoft, filed in u.s. district court in illinois in 1999, the plaintiffs alleged infringement by the browser functionality of windows. in january 2004, the trial court entered final judgment of $565 million, and entered an injunction against distribution of any new infringing products, but stayed execution of the judgment and the injunction pending our appeal. we appealed and in march 2005 the   \u00a0 \u00a0   table of contents \u00a0part ii\u00a0  item 8  \u00a0  u.s. court of appeals for the federal circuit reversed the decision and vacated the judgment, based on certain evidentiary rulings of the trial court. the appellate court also reversed the trial court\u0092s decision that the inventors had not engaged in inequitable conduct. trial has been postponed indefinitely while the parties seek to settle the matter. a settlement is not expected to have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.  microsoft and alcatel-lucent matters.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0microsoft and alcatel-lucent are parties to a number of legal proceedings relating to certain patents of each of the companies. some of these actions began before the merger of alcatel and lucent in 2006. for simplicity, we refer to the post-merger entity of alcatel-lucent throughout the following discussion.  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 the actual costs to resolve these cases will depend upon many factors such as the outcome of post-trial motions, any appeals, and the results of the remaining trials.  in z4 technologies, inc. v. microsoft, filed in u.s. district court in texas in september 2004, the plaintiff alleged that microsoft windows and office product activation functionality violates its patent rights. in april 2006, the jury rendered a $115 million verdict against us. in august 2006, the trial court increased damages by $25 million pursuant to the jury\u0092s finding of willful infringement and awarded z4 $2 million in attorneys\u0092 fees. we have appealed the verdict.  in veritas operating corporation v. microsoft, filed in u.s. district court in washington in may 2006, a subsidiary of symantec filed an action asserting trade secret misappropriation, breach of contract, and patent infringement relating to certain storage technologies.  adverse outcomes in some or all of the matters described in this section may result in significant monetary damages or injunctive relief against us that would adversely affect distribution of our operating system or application products. we may enter into material settlements because of these risks.  other.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0we are also subject to a variety of other claims and suits that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of our business. although management currently believes that resolving claims against us, individually or in aggregate, will not have a material adverse impact on our financial position, our results of operations, or our cash flows, these matters are subject to inherent uncertainties and management\u0092s view of these matters may change in the future.  \u00a0 \u00a0  table of contents \u00a0part ii\u00a0  item 8  \u00a0 as of june\u00a030, 2007, we had accrued aggregate liabilities of approximately $800 million in other current liabilities and approximately $800 million in other long-term liabilities for all of the contingent matters described in this note. while we intend to vigorously defend these matters, there exists the possibility of adverse outcomes that we estimate could be up to $4.15 billion in aggregate beyond recorded amounts. were an unfavorable final outcome to occur, there exists the possibility of a material adverse impact on the company\u0092s financial position and on the results of operations for the period in which the effect becomes reasonably estimable  note 18\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0segment information  segment revenue and operating income/(loss) was as follows:  \u00a0 \u00a0 sfas no.\u00a0131, disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information, establishes standards for reporting information about operating segments. this standard requires segmentation based on our internal organization and reporting of revenue and operating income based upon internal accounting methods. our financial reporting systems present various data for management to operate the business, including internal profit and loss statements prepared on a basis not consistent with u.s. gaap. in july 2006 we announced a change in our operating segments from seven to five reflecting previously announced reorganizations. amounts for fiscal years 2006 and 2005 have been recast to conform to the current management view. the segments are designed to allocate resources internally and provide a framework to determine management responsibility. operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise about which separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker, or decision making group, in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance. our chief operating decision maker is our chief executive officer. our five segments are client; server and tools; online services business; microsoft business division; and entertainment and devices division.  \u00a0 \u00a0   table of contents \u00a0part ii\u00a0  item 8  \u00a0 the types of products and services provided by each segment are summarized below:  client \u0096 windows vista, including home, home premium, ultimate, business, and enterprise starter edition; windows xp professional and home; media center edition; tablet pc edition; and other standard windows operating systems.  server and tools \u0096 windows server operating system; microsoft sql server; microsoft enterprise services; product support services; visual studio; system center products; forefront security products; biz talk server; msdn; and technet, among others.  online services business \u0096 msn search; mappoint; msn internet access; msn premium web services (consisting of msn internet software subscription, msn hotmail plus, msn bill pay, and msn radio plus); windows live; and msn mobile services.  microsoft business division \u0096 microsoft office; microsoft project; microsoft visio; microsoft office sharepoint server; microsoft exchange server; microsoft exchange hosted services; microsoft office live meeting; microsoft office communication server; microsoft office communicator; microsoft tellme service; microsoft dynamics ax; microsoft dynamics crm; microsoft dynamics gp; microsoft dynamics nav; microsoft dynamics sl; microsoft dynamics retail management system; microsoft partner program; and microsoft office accounting. entertainment and devices division \u0096 xbox 360 console and games; xbox live; zune; mediaroom; numerous consumer software and hardware products; windows mobile software platform; windows embedded device operating system; and windows automotive.  because of our integrated business structure, operating costs included in one segment may benefit other segments, and therefore these segments are not designed to measure operating income or loss directly related to the products included in each segment. inter-segment cost commissions are estimated by management and used to compensate or charge each segment for such shared costs and to incent shared efforts. management will continually evaluate the alignment of product development organizations, sales organizations, and inter-segment commissions for segment reporting purposes, which may result in changes to segment allocations in future periods.  assets are not allocated to segments for internal reporting presentations. a portion of amortization and depreciation is included with various other costs in an overhead allocation to each segment and it is impracticable for us to separately identify the amount of amortization and depreciation by segment that is included in the measure of segment profit or loss.  reconciling amounts include adjustments to conform with u.s. gaap and corporate-level activity not specifically attributed to a segment. significant internal accounting policies that differ from u.s. gaap relate to revenue recognition, income statement classification, period-end cut-off timing, and accelerated amortization for depreciation, stock awards, and performance-based stock awards. in addition, certain revenue and expenses are excluded from segments or included in corporate-level activity including certain legal settlements and accruals for legal contingencies.  \u00a0 \u00a0  table of contents \u00a0part ii\u00a0  item 8  \u00a0 significant reconciling items were as follows:  \u00a0 \u00a0 no sales to an individual customer accounted for more than 10% of fiscal year 2007 revenue. sales to dell and its subsidiaries accounted for approximately 11% and 10% of fiscal year 2006 and 2005 revenue, respectively. these sales were made primarily through our oem and volume licensing channels and cover a broad array of products including windows pc operating systems, microsoft office, and server products.  revenue, classified by the major geographic areas in which our customers are located, were as follows:  \u00a0 \u00a0 long-lived assets, classified by the geographic location of the controlling statutory company in which that company operates, were as

consolidated statements of income, cash flows, and stockholders\u0092 equity for each of the three years in the period ended june\u00a030, 2007.\u00a0these financial statements are the responsibility of the company\u0092s management.\u00a0our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.  we conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board (united states).\u00a0those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.\u00a0an audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.\u00a0an audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.\u00a0we believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.  in our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of microsoft corporation and subsidiaries as of june\u00a030, 2007 and 2006, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended june\u00a030, 2007, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted

in the united states of america. internal control over financial reporting includes maintaining records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect our transactions; providing reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary for preparation of our financial statements; providing reasonable assurance that receipts and expenditures of company assets are made in accordance with management authorization; and providing reasonable assurance that unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of company assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements would be prevented or detected on a timely basis. because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting is not intended to provide absolute assurance that a misstatement of our financial statements would be prevented or detected.  management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in internal control \u0096 integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission. based on this evaluation, management concluded that the company\u0092s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of june\u00a030, 2007. there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended june\u00a030, 2007 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. deloitte\u00a0& touche llp has audited this assessment of our internal control over financial reporting; their report is included in item\u00a09a.  \u00a0 \u00a0  table of contents \u00a0part ii\u00a0  item 9a  \u00a0  report of independent registered public accounting firm  to the board of directors and stockholders of microsoft corporation:  we have audited management\u0092s assessment, included in the accompanying report of management on internal control over financial reporting, that microsoft corporation and subsidiaries (the \u0093company\u0094) maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of june\u00a030, 2007, based on criteria established in internal control-integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission. the company\u0092s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. our responsibility is to express an opinion on management\u0092s assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the company\u0092s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.  we conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board (united states).\u00a0those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\u00a0our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, evaluating management\u0092s assessment, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.\u00a0we believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinions.  a company\u0092s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company's principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the company's board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.\u00a0a company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1)\u00a0pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2)\u00a0provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3)\u00a0provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.  because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.\u00a0also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.  in our opinion, management\u0092s assessment that the company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of june\u00a030, 2007, is fairly stated, in all material respects, based on the criteria established in internal control-integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission.\u00a0also in our opinion, the company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of june\u00a030, 2007, based on the criteria established in internal control-integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission.  we have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board (united states), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended june\u00a030, 2007 of the company and our report dated august\u00a03, 2007 expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.  /s/\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0deloitte\u00a0& touche llp  seattle, washington  august\u00a03, 2007  \u00a0 \u00a0   ", "table": [{}, {}, {}, {}, {"0": [["in

our interoperability initiatives. in response to competition, we continue to develop versions of our products with basic functionality that are sold at lower prices than the standard versions. these competitive pressures may result in decreased sales volumes, price reductions, and/or increased operating costs, such as for marketing and sales incentives, resulting in lower revenue, gross margins, and operating income.  we may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property rights.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0protecting our global intellectual property rights and combating unlicensed copying and use of software and other intellectual property is difficult. while piracy adversely affects u.s. revenue, the impact on revenue from outside the u.s. is more significant, particularly in countries where laws are less protective of intellectual property rights. as a result, our revenue in these markets likely will grow slower than the underlying pc market. similarly, the absence of harmonized patent laws makes it more difficult to ensure consistent respect for patent rights. throughout the world, we actively educate consumers about the benefits of licensing genuine products and obtaining indemnification benefits for intellectual property risks, and we educate lawmakers about the advantages of a business climate where intellectual property rights are protected. however, continued educational and enforcement efforts may fail to enhance revenue. reductions in the legal protection for software intellectual property rights could adversely affect revenue.  third parties may claim we infringe their intellectual property rights.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0from time to time we receive notices from others claiming we infringe their intellectual property rights. the number of these claims may grow. to resolve these claims we may enter into royalty and licensing agreements on less favorable terms, stop selling or redesign affected products, or pay damages to satisfy indemnification commitments with our customers. such agreements may cause operating margins to decline. we have made and expect to continue making significant expenditures to settle claims related to the use of technology and intellectual property rights as part of our strategy to manage this risk.  we may not be able to protect our source code from copying if there is an unauthorized disclosure of source code.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0source code, the detailed program commands for our operating systems and other software programs, is critical to our business. although we license portions of our application and operating system source code to a number of licensees, we take significant measures to protect the secrecy of large portions of our source code. if an unauthorized disclosure of a significant portion of our source code occurs, we could potentially lose future trade secret protection for that source code. this could make it easier for third parties to compete with our products by copying functionality, which could adversely affect our revenue and operating margins. unauthorized disclosure of source code also could increase the security risks described in the next paragraph.  security vulnerabilities in our products and services could lead to reduced revenues or to liability claims.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0maintaining the security of computers and computer networks is a critical issue for us and our customers. hackers develop and deploy viruses, worms, and other malicious software programs that attack our products and gain access to our networks and data centers. although this is an industry-wide problem that affects computers across all platforms, it affects our products in particular because hackers tend to focus their efforts on the most popular operating systems and programs and we expect them to continue to do so. we devote significant resources to address security vulnerabilities through:  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 the cost of these steps could reduce our operating margins. despite these efforts, actual or perceived security vulnerabilities in our products could lead some customers to seek to return products, to reduce or delay future  \u00a0 16  table of contents   \u00a0  part i  item 1a  \u00a0  \u00a0  purchases, or to use competing products. customers may also increase their expenditures on protecting their existing computer systems from attack, which could delay adoption of new technologies. any of these actions by customers could adversely affect our revenue. in addition, if third parties gain access to our networks or data centers they could obtain and exploit confidential business information and harm our competitive position. finally, actual or perceived vulnerabilities may lead to claims against us. although our license agreements typically contain provisions that eliminate or limit our exposure to such liability, there is no assurance these provisions will withstand all legal challenges.  improper disclosure of personal data could result in liability and harm our reputation.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0we store and process large amounts of personally identifiable information as we sell software, provide support and offer cloud-based services to customers. it is possible that our security controls over personal data, our training of employees and vendors on data security, and other practices we follow may not prevent the improper disclosure of personally identifiable information. improper disclosure of this information could harm our reputation, lead to legal exposure to customers, or subject us to liability under laws that protect personal data, resulting in increased costs or loss of revenue. our software products and services also enable our customers to store and process personal data. perceptions that our products or services do not adequately protect the privacy of personal information could inhibit sales of our products or services.  we may experience outages, data loss and disruptions of our online services if we fail to maintain an adequate operations infrastructure.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0our increasing user traffic and complexity of our products and services demand more computing power. we have spent and expect to continue to spend substantial amounts to purchase or lease data centers and equipment and to upgrade our technology and network infrastructure to handle increased traffic on our web sites and in our data centers, and to introduce new products and services and support existing services such as bing, exchange online, sharepoint online, xbox live, windows live, and microsoft office web apps. we also are growing our business of providing a platform and back-end hosting for services provided by third-party businesses to their end customers. maintaining and expanding this infrastructure is expensive and complex. inefficiencies or operational failures, including temporary or permanent loss of customer data, could diminish the quality of our products, services, and user experience resulting in contractual liability, claims by customers and other third parties, damage to our reputation and loss of current and potential users, subscribers, and advertisers, each of which may harm our operating results and financial condition.  we are subject to government litigation and regulatory activity that affects how we design and market our products.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0as a leading global software maker, we receive close scrutiny from government agencies under u.s. and foreign competition laws. some jurisdictions also provide private rights of action for competitors or consumers to assert claims of anti-competitive conduct. for example, we have been involved in the following actions.  lawsuits brought by the u.s. department of justice, 18 states, and the district of columbia in two separate actions were resolved through a consent decree that took effect in 2001 and a final judgment entered in 2002. these proceedings imposed various constraints on our windows operating system businesses. these constraints include limits on certain contracting practices, mandated disclosure of certain software program interfaces and protocols, and rights for computer manufacturers to limit the visibility of certain windows features in new pcs. we believe we are in full compliance with these rules. however, if we fail to comply with them, additional restrictions could be imposed on us that would adversely affect our business.  the european commission closely scrutinizes the design of high-volume microsoft products and the terms on which we make certain technologies used in these products, such as file formats, programming interfaces, and protocols, available to other companies. in 2004, the commission ordered us to create new versions of windows that do not include certain multimedia technologies and to provide our competitors with specifications for how to implement certain proprietary windows communications protocols in their own products. in 2009, the commission accepted a set of commitments offered by microsoft to address the commission\u0092s concerns relating to competition in web browsing software. the commission\u0092s impact on product design may limit our ability to innovate in windows or other products in the future, diminish the developer appeal of the windows platform, and increase our product development costs. the availability of licenses related to protocols and file formats may enable competitors to develop software products that better mimic the functionality of our own products which could result in decreased sales of our\u00a0products.  \u00a0 17  table of contents   \u00a0  part i  item 1a  \u00a0  \u00a0 government regulatory actions and court decisions such as these may hinder our ability to provide the benefits of our software to consumers and businesses, thereby reducing the attractiveness of our products and the revenues that come from them. new actions could be initiated at any time, either by these or other governments or private claimants, including with respect to new versions of windows or other microsoft products. the outcome of such actions, or steps taken to avoid them, could adversely affect us in a variety of ways, including:  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 our software and services online offerings are subject to government regulation of the internet domestically and internationally in many areas, including user privacy, telecommunications, data protection, and online content. the application of these laws and regulations to our business is often unclear and sometimes may conflict. compliance with these regulations may involve significant costs or require changes in business practices that result in reduced revenue. noncompliance could result in penalties being imposed on us or orders that we stop the alleged noncompliant activity.  our business depends on our ability to attract and retain talented employees.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0our business is based on successfully attracting and retaining talented employees. the market for highly skilled workers and leaders in our industry is extremely competitive. we are limited in our ability to recruit internationally by restrictive domestic immigration laws. if we are less successful in our recruiting efforts, or if we are unable to retain key employees, our ability to develop and deliver successful products and services may be adversely affected. effective succession planning is also important to our long-term success. failure to ensure effective transfer of knowledge and smooth transitions involving key employees could hinder our strategic planning and execution.  delays in product development schedules may adversely affect our revenues.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0the development of software products is a complex and time-consuming process. new products and enhancements to existing products can require long development and testing periods. our increasing focus on cloud-based software plus services also presents new and complex development issues. significant delays in new product or service releases or significant problems in creating new products or services could adversely affect our revenue.  we make significant investments in new products and services that may not be profitable.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0our growth depends on our ability to innovate by offering new, and adding value to our existing, software and service offerings. we will continue to make significant investments in research, development, and marketing for new products, services, and technologies, including the windows pc operating system, the microsoft office system, xbox 360, bing, windows server, zune, windows live, the windows azure services platform, and other cloud-based services offerings. investments in new technology are speculative. commercial success depends on many factors, including innovativeness, developer support, and effective distribution and marketing. our degree of success with windows phone, for example, will impact our ability to grow share of the smartphone operating system market. it will also be an important factor in supporting our strategy of delivering value to end users seamlessly over pc, phone, and tv device classes. if customers do not perceive our latest offerings as providing significant new functionality or other value, they may reduce their purchases of new software products or upgrades, unfavorably impacting revenue. we may not achieve significant revenue from new product and service investments for a number of years, if at all. moreover, new products and services may not be profitable, and even if they are profitable, operating margins for new products and businesses may not be as high as the margins we have experienced historically.  adverse economic conditions may harm our business.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0unfavorable changes in economic conditions, including inflation, recession, or other changes in economic conditions, may result in lower information technology spending and adversely affect our revenue. if demand for pcs, servers, and other computing devices declines, or consumer or business spending for those products declines, our revenue will be adversely affected.\u00a0our product distribution  \u00a0 18  table of contents   \u00a0  part i  item 1a  \u00a0  \u00a0  system also relies on an extensive partner network. the impact of economic conditions on our partners, such as the bankruptcy of a major distributor, could result in sales channel disruption. challenging economic conditions also may impair the ability of our customers to pay for products and services they have purchased. as a result, reserves for doubtful accounts and write-offs of accounts receivable may increase. we maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings, types, and maturities. these investments are subject to general credit, liquidity, market, and interest rate risks, which may be exacerbated by unusual events that have affected global financial markets. if global credit and equity markets experience prolonged periods of decline, our investment portfolio may be adversely impacted and we could determine that more of our investments have experienced an other-than-temporary decline in fair value, requiring impairment charges that could adversely impact our financial results.  we have claims and lawsuits against us that may result in adverse outcomes.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0we are subject to a variety of claims and lawsuits. adverse outcomes in some or all of these claims may result in significant monetary damages or injunctive relief that could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business. although management currently believes resolving all of these matters, individually or in the aggregate, will not have a material adverse impact on our financial statements, the litigation and other claims are subject to inherent uncertainties and management\u0092s view of these matters may change in the future. a material adverse impact on our financial statements also could occur for the period in which the effect of an unfavorable final outcome becomes probable and reasonably estimable.  we may have additional tax liabilities.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0we are subject to income taxes in the united states and many foreign jurisdictions. significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes. in the ordinary course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. we regularly are under audit by tax authorities. although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals. the results of an audit or litigation could have a material effect on our financial statements in the period or periods for which that determination is made.  we earn a significant amount of our operating income from outside the u.s., and any repatriation of funds currently held in foreign jurisdictions may result in higher effective tax rates for the company. in addition, there have been proposals to change u.s. tax laws that would significantly impact how u.s. multinational corporations are taxed on foreign earnings.\u00a0although we cannot predict whether or in what form this proposed legislation will pass, if enacted it could have a material adverse impact on our tax expense and cash flow.  our vertically-integrated hardware and software products may experience quality or supply problems.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0our hardware products such as the xbox 360 console are highly complex and can have defects in design, manufacture, or associated software. we could incur significant expenses, lost revenue, and reputational harm if we fail to detect or effectively address such issues through design, testing, or warranty repairs. we obtain some components of our hardware devices from sole suppliers. if a component delivery from a sole-source supplier is delayed or becomes unavailable or industry shortages occur, we may be unable to obtain timely replacement supplies, resulting in reduced sales. either component shortages or excess or obsolete inventory may increase our cost of revenue. xbox 360 consoles are assembled in asia; disruptions in the supply chain may result in console shortages that would affect our revenues and operating margins. these same risks would apply to any other vertically-integrated hardware and software products we may offer.  if our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets become impaired we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states (\u0093u.s. gaap\u0094), we review our amortizable intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually. factors that may be considered a change in circumstances, indicating that the carrying value of our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets may not be recoverable, include a decline in stock price and market capitalization, reduced future cash flow estimates, and slower growth rates in our industry. we may be required to record a significant charge in our financial statements during the period in which any impairment of our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets is determined, negatively impacting our results of operations.  we operate a global business that exposes us to additional risks.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0we operate in over 100 countries and a significant part of our revenue comes from international sales. pressure to make our pricing structure uniform might require that we reduce the sales price of our software in the united states and other countries. operations outside  \u00a0 19  table of contents   \u00a0  part ii  item 7  \u00a0  \u00a0 in addition, we continue to invest in research and development in existing and new lines of business, including cloud computing, search, online solutions, business solutions, mobile computing, communication, entertainment, and other areas that we believe may contribute to our long-term growth. we also invest in research and development of advanced technologies for future software products. we believe that delivering innovative and high-value solutions through our integrated platform is the key to meeting customer needs and to our future growth.  this long-term focus on investment in research and development has enabled us to lay a foundation for future growth by delivering innovative products, creating opportunities for partners, and improving customer satisfaction. our focus in fiscal year 2011 is to build on this foundation and to continue to execute well in key areas through ongoing innovation on our integrated software platform, by responding effectively to customer and partner needs, and by focusing internally on product excellence, business efficacy, and accountability across the company.  summary of results for fiscal years 2010, 2009, and 2008  \u00a0  fiscal year 2010 compared with fiscal year 2009  revenue increased mainly due to strong sales of windows 7, which was released during fiscal year 2010, and pc market improvement. operating income increased reflecting the change in revenue, offset in part by higher operating expenses.  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 diluted earnings per share increased reflecting increased net income and the repurchase of 380\u00a0million shares during fiscal year 2010.  fiscal year 2009 compared with fiscal year 2008  revenue declined across most segments primarily driven by weakness in the global pc market and the unfavorable economic environment. primary factors contributing to the decline include the following:  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 23  table of contents   \u00a0  part ii  item 7  \u00a0  \u00a0 the above declines were partially offset by increased server and server application revenue, reflecting recognition of deferred revenue from previously signed agreements and continued adoption of the windows server platform and applications through sql server, enterprise cal suites, and system center products. foreign currency exchange rates had a favorable impact of $486 million on revenue.  operating income decreased primarily reflecting decreased revenue. operating expenses were flat with decreased general and administrative and sales and marketing expenses offset by increased headcount-related expenses, cost of revenue, and employee severance charges.  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 in january 2009, we announced and implemented a resource management program to reduce discretionary operating expenses, employee headcount, and capital expenditures. as part of this program, we announced the elimination of up to 5,000 positions in research and development, marketing, sales, finance, legal, human resources, and information technology by june\u00a030, 2010. during fiscal year 2009, we recorded employee severance charges of $330 million for the expected reduction in employee headcount.  diluted earnings per share declined primarily reflecting decreased net income, partially offset by share repurchases during the prior 12 months. we repurchased 318\u00a0million shares during fiscal year 2009.  segment product revenue/operating income (loss)  the revenue and operating income (loss) amounts in this section are presented on a basis consistent with accounting principles generally accepted in the u.s. (\u0093u.s. gaap\u0094) and include certain reconciling items attributable to each of the segments. segment information appearing in note 22 \u0096 segment information and geographic data of the notes to financial statements (part ii, item\u00a08 of this form 10-k) is presented on a basis consistent with our current internal management reporting. certain corporate-level activity has been excluded from segment operating results and is analyzed separately. we have recast certain prior period amounts within this md&a to conform to the way we internally managed and monitored segment performance during the current fiscal year, including moving windows live from online services division to windows\u00a0& windows live division, and razorfish from online services division to corporate. razorfish was sold during the second quarter of fiscal year 2010.  windows\u00a0& windows live division  \u00a0  \u00a0 24  table of contents   \u00a0  part ii  item 7  \u00a0  \u00a0 windows\u00a0& windows live division (\u0093windows division\u0094) offerings consist of premium and standard edition windows operating systems and online software and services through windows live. premium windows operating systems are those that include additional functionality and are sold at a price above our standard editions. premium editions include windows 7 home premium, windows 7 professional, windows 7 ultimate, windows 7 enterprise, windows vista business, windows vista home premium, windows vista ultimate, and windows vista enterprise. standard editions include windows 7 starter, windows 7 home basic, windows vista starter, windows vista home basic, and windows xp home. windows live primarily generates revenue from online advertising.  windows division revenue growth is largely correlated to the growth of pc purchases from original equipment manufacturers (\u0093oems\u0094) that pre-install versions of windows operating systems because the oem channel accounts for approximately 80% of total windows division revenue. the remaining approximately 20% of windows division revenue (\u0093other revenue\u0094) is generated by commercial and retail sales of windows and online advertising from windows live.  fiscal year 2010 compared with fiscal year 2009  windows division revenue increased primarily as a result of strong sales of windows 7 and pc market improvement. we estimate total pc shipments from all sources grew approximately 16% to 18%. oem revenue increased $2.6 billion or 22%, while oem license units increased 21%. the oem revenue increase was driven by pc market growth, higher windows attach rates across consumer and business segments, the restoration of normal oem inventory levels, and the mix of versions of windows licensed, offset in part by pc market changes, including stronger growth of emerging markets versus developed markets and of consumer pcs versus business pcs. fiscal year 2009 oem revenue reflects a $273 million windows 7 deferral, as discussed under overview and outlook above. this amount was subsequently recognized in fiscal year 2010. other revenue increased $912 million or 29% driven primarily by windows 7 retail sales.  windows division operating income increased as a result of increased revenue, offset in part by higher operating expenses. cost of revenue increased $296 million or 22%, primarily driven by royalties and other product costs. sales and marketing expenses increased $256 million or 11% reflecting increased advertising and marketing of windows 7.  fiscal year 2009 compared with fiscal year 2008  windows division revenue decreased primarily as a result of pc market weakness, especially pcs sold to businesses. oem revenue decreased $2.3 billion or 16% while oem license units declined 2%. based on our estimates, total worldwide pc shipments from all sources experienced a decline of approximately 1% to growth of approximately 2%, driven by changes in demand in emerging and developed markets.  windows division operating income decreased primarily reflecting decreased revenue and increased sales and marketing expenses. sales and marketing expenses increased $100 million or 5%, primarily reflecting increased advertising and marketing.  server and tools  \u00a0  server and tools licenses products, applications, tools, content, and delivers enterprise services, all of which are designed to make information

agreements, approximately 30% is purchased through transactional volume licensing programs, retail packaged product and licenses sold to oems, and the remainder comes from enterprise services.  fiscal year 2010 compared with fiscal year 2009  server and tools revenue increased mainly reflecting growth in product revenue. product revenue increased $652 million or 6%, driven primarily by growth in windows server, sql server and enterprise cal suites revenue, reflecting increased revenue from annuity volume licensing agreements and continued adoption of windows platform applications, offset in part by a decline in developer tools revenue. enterprise services revenue was relatively flat, with growth in premier product support services nearly offset by decreased consulting services.  server and tools operating income increased due mainly to revenue growth and reduced research and development expenses, offset in part by increased cost of revenue. research and development expenses decreased $38 million or 2%, primarily driven by reduced third-party development and programming costs and headcount-related expenses, offset in part by increased hosting, localization and lab costs. cost of revenue increased $25 million.  fiscal year 2009 compared with fiscal year 2008  server and tools revenue increased reflecting growth in both product and services revenue. product revenue increased $741 million or 7%, primarily driven by growth in sql server, enterprise cal suites, and system center revenue. this growth reflects recognition of deferred revenue from previously signed

billion, reflecting higher search and display advertising revenue, offset in part by decreased advertiser and publisher tools revenue. access revenue decreased $57 million or 31%, reflecting continued migration of subscribers to broadband or other competitively-priced service providers.  osd operating loss increased due to increased operating expenses, offset in part by increased revenue. cost of revenue increased $565 million, primarily driven by higher online traffic acquisition costs and yahoo! reimbursement and implementation costs. general and administrative expenses increased $136 million. sales and marketing expenses increased $56 million or 5% due mainly to increased marketing of bing, offset in part by decreased headcount-related expenses.  fiscal year 2009 compared with

dynamics products provide business solutions for financial management, customer relationship management, supply chain management, and analytics applications for small and mid-size businesses, large organizations, and divisions of global enterprises. we evaluate our results based upon the nature of the end user in two primary parts: business revenue, which includes microsoft office system revenue generated through volume licensing agreements and microsoft dynamics revenue; and consumer revenue, which includes revenue from retail packaged product sales and oem revenue.  \u00a0 27  table of contents   \u00a0  part ii  item 7  \u00a0  \u00a0 fiscal year 2010 compared with fiscal year 2009  mbd revenue decreased primarily as a result of the net deferral of $254 million of revenue related to eligible sales of the 2007 microsoft office system with a guarantee to be upgraded to the 2010 microsoft office system at minimal or no cost (the \u0093office 2010 deferral\u0094). consumer revenue decreased $166 million or 5%, primarily due to the office 2010 deferral, offset in part by growth in the pc market and sales of the 2010 microsoft office system, which was launched during the fourth quarter. business revenue decreased $102 million or 1%, primarily reflecting a decline in licensing of the 2007 microsoft office system to transactional business customers, offset in part by growth in multi-year volume licensing agreement revenue and licensing of the 2010 microsoft office system to transactional business customers. microsoft dynamics revenue was flat.  mbd operating income increased due mainly to decreased operating expenses, offset in part by decreased revenue. sales and marketing expenses decreased $266 million or 6%, primarily driven by a decrease in corporate marketing activities. research and development expenses decreased $187 million or 11%, primarily as a result of capitalization of certain microsoft office system software development costs and lower headcount-related expenses. general and administrative expenses decreased $53 million or 18% primarily due to expenses in the prior year associated with the acquisition of fast search\u00a0& transfer asa (\u0093fast\u0094) and lower headcount-related expenses. these decreases were offset in part by a $126 million or 11% increase in cost of revenue, primarily driven by increased traffic acquisition costs and increased costs of providing services.  fiscal year 2009 compared with fiscal year 2008  mbd revenue was flat reflecting increased business revenue offset by decreased consumer revenue. business revenue increased $458\u00a0million or 3%, primarily reflecting growth in volume licensing agreement revenue and included a 7% decrease in microsoft dynamics customer billings. the growth in volume licensing agreement revenue primarily reflects recognition of deferred revenue from previously signed agreements. consumer revenue decreased $447 million or 12%, primarily as a result of pc market weakness, a shift to lower-priced products, and pricing promotions on the 2007 microsoft office system.  mbd revenue included a favorable foreign currency exchange impact of $378 million.  mbd operating income decreased reflecting increased cost of revenue and research and development expenses, partially offset by decreased sales and marketing expenses. cost of revenue increased $134

compared with fiscal year 2008  general and administrative expenses decreased primarily reflecting decreased costs for legal settlements and legal contingencies. we incurred legal charges of $283 million in fiscal year 2009, as compared with $1.8 billion during fiscal year 2008. the fiscal year 2008 legal costs were primarily related to the european commission fine of $1.4 billion (\u0080899 million).  employee severance  in january 2009, we announced and implemented a resource management program to reduce employee headcount. we completed this program in fiscal year 2010, reducing our overall headcount by approximately 5,300 in various functions, including research and development, marketing, sales, finance, legal, human resources, and information technology. during fiscal years 2010 and 2009, we recorded employee severance expense of $59 million and $330 million, respectively.  other income (expense) and income taxes  other income (expense)  the components of other income (expense) were as follows:  \u00a0 \u00a0 we use derivative instruments to manage risks related to foreign currencies, equity prices, interest rates, and credit; to enhance investment returns; and to facilitate portfolio diversification. gains and losses from changes in fair values of derivatives that are not designated as hedges are recognized in other income (expense). these are generally offset by unrealized gains and losses in the underlying securities in the investment portfolio and are recorded as a component of other comprehensive income.  fiscal year 2010 compared with fiscal year 2009  dividends and interest income increased primarily due to higher average portfolio investment balances, offset in part by lower yields on our fixed-income investments. interest expense increased due to our issuance of long term debt in may 2009. net recognized gains on investments increased primarily due to lower other-than-temporary impairments, offset in part by lower gains on sales of investments in the current period. other-than-temporary impairments were $69 million during fiscal year 2010, as compared with $862 million during fiscal year 2009 and decreased primarily due to improvements in market conditions. net losses on derivatives decreased due to gains on equity and interest rate derivatives as compared to losses in the prior period and lower losses on commodity and foreign currency contracts in the current period. net gains from foreign currency remeasurements were insignificant in fiscal year 2010 compared to net losses of $509 million in the prior year, which had resulted from the strengthening of the u.s. dollar in the prior year. for fiscal year 2010, other includes a gain on the divestiture of razorfish.  \u00a0 32  table of contents   \u00a0  part ii  item 7  \u00a0  \u00a0 fiscal year 2009 compared with fiscal year 2008  dividends and interest income decreased primarily reflecting lower interest rates on our fixed-income investments. interest expense decreased due to lower average collateral balances on loaned securities and related rates. net recognized losses on investments increased primarily due to higher other-than-temporary impairments that were partially offset by gains on sales of certain equity investments held in our strategic investments portfolio. other-than- temporary impairments were $862 million during fiscal year 2009, as compared with $312 million during fiscal year 2008 and increased primarily due to declines in equity values as a result of deterioration in equity markets. net losses on derivatives increased primarily due to losses on equity, commodity, and interest rate derivatives in fiscal year 2009 as compared with gains in the prior period. net losses on foreign currency remeasurements increased due to the strengthening of the u.s. dollar, particularly in the first half of the fiscal year 2009.  income taxes  fiscal year 2010 compared with fiscal year 2009  our effective tax rates in fiscal years 2010 and 2009 were 25% and 27%, respectively. the fiscal year 2010 rate reflects a higher mix of foreign earnings taxed at lower rates.  fiscal year 2009 compared with fiscal year 2008  our effective tax rates in fiscal years 2009 and 2008 were 27% and 26%, respectively. while the fiscal year 2009 rate reflects a higher mix of foreign earnings taxed at lower rates, the rate increased from the prior year because the fiscal year 2008 rate reflects the resolution of tax positions relating to our agreement with the internal revenue service (\u0093irs\u0094) settling the 2000-2003 examination, partially offset by the european commission fine which was not tax deductible. as a result of the settlement and the impact on subsequent years, we paid the irs approximately $4.1 billion during fiscal year 2009.  financial condition  cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments totaled $36.8 billion as of june\u00a030, 2010, compared with $31.4 billion as of june\u00a030, 2009. equity and other investments were $7.8 billion as of june\u00a030, 2010, compared with $4.9 billion as of june\u00a030, 2009. our short-term investments are primarily to facilitate liquidity and for capital preservation. they consist predominantly of investment grade fixed-income securities, diversified among industries and individual issuers. the investments are predominantly u.s. dollar-denominated securities, but also include foreign currency-denominated securities in order to diversify risk.  in general, and where applicable, we use quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities to determine fair value.\u00a0this pricing methodology applies to our level 1 investments, such as exchange-traded mutual funds, domestic and international equities, and u.s. treasuries.\u00a0if quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities are not available to determine fair value, then we use quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities or inputs other than the quoted prices that are observable either directly or indirectly. this pricing methodology applies to our level 2 investments such as corporate notes and bonds, foreign government bonds, mortgage-backed securities, and agency securities.\u00a0level 3 investments are valued using internally developed models with unobservable inputs.\u00a0assets and liabilities measured using unobservable inputs are an immaterial portion of our portfolio.  a majority of our investments are priced by pricing vendors and are generally level 1 or level 2 investments as these vendors either provide a quoted market price in an active market or use observable inputs for their pricing without applying significant adjustments.\u00a0broker pricing is used mainly when a quoted price is not available, the investment is not priced by our pricing vendors, or when a broker price is more reflective of fair values in the market in which the investment trades. our broker-priced investments are generally labeled as level 2 investments because the broker prices these investments based on similar assets without applying significant adjustments.\u00a0in addition, all  \u00a0 33  table of contents   \u00a0  part ii  item 7  \u00a0  \u00a0  of our broker-priced investments have a sufficient level of trading volume to demonstrate that the fair values used are appropriate for these investments. our fair value processes include controls that are designed to ensure appropriate fair values are recorded. these\u00a0controls include model validation, review of key model inputs, analysis of period-over-period fluctuations, and independent recalculation of prices where appropriate.  while we own certain mortgage-backed and asset-backed fixed-income securities, our portfolio as of june\u00a030, 2010 does not contain direct exposure to subprime mortgages or structured vehicles that derive their value from subprime collateral. the majority of the mortgage-backed securities are collateralized by prime residential mortgages and carry a 100% principal and interest guarantee, primarily from federal national mortgage association, federal home loan mortgage corporation, and government national mortgage association.  we lend certain fixed-income and equity securities to increase investment returns. the loaned securities continue to be carried as investments on our balance sheet. cash and/or security interests are received as collateral for the loaned securities with the amount determined based upon the underlying security lent and the creditworthiness of the borrower. cash received is recorded as an asset with a corresponding liability.  debt  in september 2008, our board of directors authorized debt financings of up to $6.0 billion. as of june\u00a030, 2010, we had $6.0 billion of issued and outstanding debt comprised of $1.0 billion of commercial paper and $5.0 billion of long-term debt including $1.25 billion of convertible debt.  short-term debt  as of june\u00a030, 2010, our $1.0 billion of commercial paper issued and outstanding had a weighted average interest rate, including issuance costs, of 0.20% and maturities of 22 to 216 days. in november 2009, we replaced our $2.0 billion and $1.0 billion credit facilities with a $2.25 billion 364-day credit facility, which expires on november\u00a05, 2010. this facility serves as a back-up for our commercial paper program. in june 2010, we reduced the size of our credit facility from $2.25 billion to $1.0 billion due to the reduction in commercial paper outstanding. as of june\u00a030, 2010, we were in compliance with the financial covenant in the credit facility agreement, which requires a coverage ratio be maintained of at least three times earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization to interest expense. no amounts were drawn against the credit facility during any of the periods presented.  long-term debt  notes  as of june\u00a030, 2010, we had issued and outstanding $3.75 billion of debt securities as follows: $2.0 billion aggregate principal amount of 2.95% notes due 2014, $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of 4.20% notes due 2019, and $750 million aggregate principal amount of 5.20% notes due 2039 (collectively \u0093the notes\u0094). interest on the notes is payable semi-annually on june\u00a01 and december\u00a01 of each year to holders of record on the preceding may\u00a015 and november\u00a015.\u00a0the notes are senior unsecured obligations and rank equally with our other unsecured and unsubordinated debt outstanding.  convertible debt  in june 2010, we issued $1.25 billion of zero coupon convertible unsecured debt due on june\u00a015, 2013 in a private placement offering. proceeds from the offering were $1.24 billion, net of fees and expenses which were capitalized. the majority of the proceeds were used to repay outstanding commercial paper, leaving $1.0 billion of commercial paper outstanding as of june\u00a030, 2010. each $1,000 principal amount of notes is convertible into 29.94 shares of microsoft common stock at a conversion price of $33.40 per share.  \u00a0 34  table of contents   \u00a0  part ii  item 7  \u00a0  \u00a0 prior to march\u00a015, 2013, the notes will be convertible, only in certain circumstances, into cash and, if applicable, cash, shares of microsoft\u0092s common stock or a combination thereof, at our election. on or after march\u00a015, 2013, the notes will be convertible at any time. upon conversion, we will pay cash up to the aggregate principal amount of the notes and pay or deliver cash, shares of our common stock or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock, at our election.  because the convertible debt may be wholly or partially settled in cash, we are required to separately account for the liability and equity components of the notes in a manner that reflects our nonconvertible debt borrowing rate when interest costs are recognized in subsequent periods. the net proceeds of $1.24 billion were allocated between debt for $1.18 billion and stockholders\u0092 equity for $58 million, with the portion in stockholders\u0092 equity representing the fair value of the option to convert the debt.  in connection with the issuance of the notes, we entered into capped call transactions with certain option counterparties who are initial purchasers of the notes or their affiliates. the capped call transactions are expected to reduce potential dilution of earnings per share upon conversion of the notes. under the capped call transactions, we purchased from the option counterparties capped call options that in the aggregate relate to the total number of shares of our common stock underlying the notes, with a strike price equal to the conversion price of the notes and with a cap price initially equal to $37.16. the purchased capped calls were valued at $40 million and were charged to stockholders\u0092 equity.  unearned revenue  unearned revenue at june\u00a030, 2010 comprised mainly unearned revenue from volume licensing programs. unearned revenue from volume licensing programs represents customer billings for multi-year licensing arrangements paid for either at inception of the agreement or annually at the beginning of each billing coverage period and accounted for as subscriptions with revenue recognized ratably over the billing coverage period. unearned revenue at june\u00a030, 2010 also included payments for: post-delivery support and consulting services to be performed in the future, xbox live subscriptions; unspecified upgrades/enhancements of microsoft internet explorer on a when-and-if-available basis for windows xp; microsoft dynamics business solutions products; technology guarantee programs, including the 2010 microsoft office technology guarantee program; and other offerings for which we have been paid in advance and earn the revenue when we provide the service or software, or otherwise meet the revenue recognition criteria.  the following table outlines the expected future recognition of unearned revenue as of june\u00a030, 2010:  \u00a0 cash flows  fiscal year 2010 compared with fiscal year 2009  cash flow from operations increased $5.0 billion, primarily due to payment of $4.1 billion to the internal revenue service in the prior year as a result of our settlement of the 2000-2003 audit examination along with increased cash received from customers in the current year. cash used for financing increased $5.8 billion, primarily due to a $5.6 billion decrease in net cash proceeds from issuance and repayments of short-term and long-term debt. financing activities also included a $1.9 billion increase in cash used for common stock repurchases, which was offset in part  \u00a0 35  table of contents   \u00a0  part ii  item 7  \u00a0  \u00a0  by a $1.7 billion increase in cash received from common stock issued. cash used for investing decreased $4.5 billion due to a $3.3 billion decrease in cash used for combined investment purchases, sales, and maturities along with a $1.1 billion decrease in additions to property and equipment.  fiscal year 2009 compared with fiscal year 2008  cash flow from operations decreased $2.6 billion due to payment of approximately $4.1 billion to the irs in connection with our settlement of the 2000-2003 audit examination. this impact was partially offset by the fiscal year 2008 payment of the $1.4 billion (\u0080899 million) european commission fine. cash used for financing decreased $5.5 billion primarily due to $5.7 billion of net cash proceeds from issuance of short-term and long-term debt in fiscal year 2009. financing activities also included a $3.2 billion decrease in common stock repurchased, which was offset by a $2.9 billion decline in common stock issued. cash used for investing increased $11.2 billion due to a $15.9 billion rise in purchases of investments along with a $1.7 billion decrease in cash from investment sales and maturities. these impacts were partially offset by a $7.2 billion decrease in cash paid for acquisition of companies, including the purchase of aquantive in fiscal year 2008.  share repurchases  on september\u00a022, 2008, we announced the completion of the two repurchase programs approved by our board of directors during the first quarter of fiscal year 2007 (the \u00932007 programs\u0094) to buy back up to $40.0 billion of microsoft common stock. on september\u00a022, 2008, we also announced that our board of directors approved a new share repurchase program authorizing up to $40.0 billion in share repurchases with an expiration date of september\u00a030, 2013 (the \u00932008 program\u0094). as of june\u00a030, 2010, approximately $23.7 billion remained of the $40.0 billion approved repurchase amount. the repurchase program may be suspended or discontinued at any time without notice.  during the periods reported, we repurchased with cash resources: 380\u00a0million shares for $10.8 billion during fiscal year 2010; 318\u00a0million shares for $8.2 billion during fiscal year 2009; and 402\u00a0million shares for $12.4 billion during fiscal year 2008. all shares repurchased in fiscal year 2010 were repurchased under the 2008 program, while all shares repurchased in fiscal year 2008 were repurchased under the 2007 programs. of the shares repurchased in fiscal year 2009, 101\u00a0million shares were repurchased for $2.7 billion under the 2007 programs, while the remainder were repurchased under the 2008 program.  dividends  during fiscal years 2010 and 2009, our board of directors declared the following dividends:  \u00a0  off-balance sheet arrangements  we provide indemnifications of varying scope and size to certain customers against claims of intellectual property infringement made by third parties arising from the use of our products and certain other matters. in evaluating  \u00a0 36  table of contents   \u00a0  part ii  item 7  \u00a0  \u00a0  estimated losses on these indemnifications, we consider factors such as the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and our ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss. to date, we have not encountered significant costs as a result of these obligations and have not accrued any liabilities related to these indemnifications in our financial statements.  contractual obligations  the following table summarizes the payments due by fiscal year for our outstanding contractual obligations as of june\u00a030, 2010. we expect to fund these commitments with existing cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and cash flows from operations.  \u00a0 \u00a0 other planned uses of capital  we will continue to invest in sales, marketing, product support infrastructure, and existing and advanced areas of technology. additions to property and equipment will continue, including new facilities, data centers, and computer systems for research and development, sales and marketing, support, and administrative staff. we have operating leases for most u.s. and international sales and support offices and certain equipment. we have not engaged in any related party transactions or arrangements with unconsolidated entities or other persons that are reasonably likely to materially affect liquidity or the availability of capital resources.  we believe existing cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, together with funds generated from operations, should be sufficient to meet operating requirements, regular quarterly dividends, debt repayment schedules, and share repurchases. our philosophy regarding the maintenance of a balance sheet with a large component of cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, and equity and other investments, reflects our views on potential future capital requirements relating to research and development, creation and expansion of sales distribution channels, investments and acquisitions, share dilution management, legal risks, and challenges to our business model. we regularly assess our investment management approach in view of our current and potential future needs.  \u00a0  37  table of contents   \u00a0  part ii  item 7  \u00a0  \u00a0 as a result of the special dividend paid in the second quarter of fiscal year 2005 and shares repurchased, our retained deficit, including accumulated other comprehensive income, was $16.7 billion at june\u00a030, 2010. our retained deficit is not expected to affect our future ability to operate, pay dividends, or repay our debt given our continuing profitability and strong cash and financial position.  recent legislation  in march 2010, the patient protection and affordable care act and the health care and education reconciliation act of 2010 were signed into law in the united states. this legislation expands health care coverage to many uninsured individuals and expands coverage to those already insured. the changes required by this legislation will largely be funded through tax increases to both insurers and the insured. we do not expect any near term impact on our financial results as a result of the legislation. one provision that will impact certain companies significantly is the elimination of the tax deductibility of the medicare part d subsidy. this provision does not affect us because we do not provide retiree health benefits.  recently issued accounting standards  recently adopted accounting pronouncements  in january 2010, the financial accounting standards board (\u0093fasb\u0094) issued guidance to amend the disclosure requirements related to recurring and nonrecurring fair value measurements.\u00a0the guidance requires new disclosures on the transfers of assets and liabilities between level 1 (quoted prices in active market for identical assets or liabilities) and level 2 (significant other observable inputs) of the fair value measurement hierarchy, including the reasons and the timing of the transfers.\u00a0additionally, the guidance requires a roll forward of activities on purchases, sales, issuance, and settlements of the assets and liabilities measured using significant unobservable inputs (level 3 fair value measurements). the guidance became effective for us with the reporting period beginning january\u00a01, 2010, except for the disclosure on the roll forward activities for level 3 fair value measurements, which will become effective for us with the reporting period beginning july\u00a01, 2011.\u00a0other than requiring additional disclosures, adoption of this new guidance did not have a material impact on our financial statements.  on july\u00a01, 2009, we adopted guidance issued by the fasb on business combinations. the guidance retains the fundamental requirements that the acquisition method of accounting (previously referred to as the purchase method of accounting) be used for all business combinations, but requires a number of changes, including changes in the way assets and liabilities are recognized and measured as a result of business combinations. it also requires the capitalization of in-process research and development at fair value and requires the expensing of acquisition-related costs as incurred. we have applied this guidance to business combinations completed since july\u00a01, 2009.  on july\u00a01, 2009, we adopted guidance issued by the fasb that changes the accounting and reporting for non-controlling interests. non-controlling interests are to be reported as a component of equity separate from the parent\u0092s equity, and purchases or sales of equity interests that do not result in a change in control are to be accounted for as equity transactions. in addition, net income attributable to a non-controlling interest is to be included in net income and, upon a loss of control, the interest sold, as well as any interest retained, is to be recorded at fair value with any gain or loss recognized in net income. adoption of the new guidance did not have a material impact on our financial statements.  on july\u00a01, 2009, we adopted guidance on fair value measurement for nonfinancial assets and liabilities, except for items that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis (at least annually). adoption of the new guidance did not have a material impact on our financial statements.  recent accounting pronouncements not yet adopted  in october 2009, the fasb issued guidance on revenue recognition that will become effective for us beginning july\u00a01, 2010. under the new guidance on arrangements that include software elements, tangible products that have software components that are essential to the functionality of the tangible product will no longer be within the scope  \u00a0 38  table of contents   \u00a0  part ii  item 7  \u00a0  \u00a0  of the software revenue recognition guidance, and software-enabled products will now be subject to other relevant revenue recognition guidance. additionally, the fasb issued guidance on revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables that are outside the scope of the software revenue recognition guidance. under the new guidance, when vendor specific objective evidence or third party evidence for deliverables in an arrangement cannot be determined, a best estimate of the selling price is required to separate deliverables and allocate arrangement consideration using the relative selling price method. the new guidance includes new disclosure requirements on how the application of the relative selling price method affects the timing and amount of revenue recognition. we believe adoption of this new guidance will not have a material impact on our financial statements.  in june 2009, the fasb issued guidance on the consolidation of variable interest entities, which is effective for us beginning july\u00a01, 2010. the new guidance requires revised evaluations of whether entities represent variable interest entities, ongoing assessments of control over such entities, and additional disclosures for variable interests. we believe adoption of this new guidance will not have a material impact on our financial statements.  application of critical accounting policies  our financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states (\u0093u.s. gaap\u0094). preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. these estimates and assumptions are affected by management\u0092s application of accounting policies. critical accounting policies for us include revenue recognition, impairment of investment securities, goodwill, research and development costs, contingencies, income taxes, stock-based compensation, and product warranties.  revenue recognition  software revenue recognition requires judgment, including whether a software arrangement includes multiple elements, and if so, whether vendor-specific objective evidence (\u0093vsoe\u0094) of fair value exists for those elements. a portion of revenue may be recorded as unearned due to undelivered elements. the amount of revenue allocated to undelivered elements is based on the vsoe of fair value for those elements using the residual method or relative fair value method, and the deferred revenue is recognized as the elements are delivered. changes to the elements in a software arrangement, the ability to identify vsoe for those elements, the fair value of the respective elements, and changes to a product\u0092s estimated life cycle could materially impact the amount of earned and unearned revenue. judgment is also required to assess whether future releases of certain software represent new products or upgrades and enhancements to existing products.  a portion of the revenue related to windows xp is recorded as unearned due to the right to receive unspecified upgrades/enhancements of microsoft internet explorer on a when-and-if-available basis. revenue related to windows vista and windows 7 is not subject to a similar deferral because there are no significant undelivered elements. 2007 microsoft office system revenue is subject to deferral as a result of the 2010 microsoft office system technology guarantee program, which started march\u00a05, 2010. this program allows customers who purchased certain versions of the 2007 microsoft office system to receive an upgrade to the corresponding version of the 2010 microsoft office system at minimal or no cost when the product becomes generally available. accordingly, estimated revenue related to the undelivered 2010 microsoft office system is deferred until the product is delivered.  impairment of investment securities  investments are reviewed quarterly for indicators of other-than-temporary impairment. this determination requires significant judgment. in making this judgment, we employ a systematic methodology quarterly that considers available quantitative and qualitative evidence in evaluating potential impairment of our investments. if the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value, we evaluate, among other factors, general market conditions, credit quality of debt instrument issuers, the duration and extent to which the fair value is less than cost, and for equity securities, our intent and ability to hold, or plans to sell, the investment. for fixed income securities, we also evaluate whether we have plans to sell the security or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery.  \u00a0 39  table of contents   \u00a0  part ii  item 7  \u00a0  \u00a0  we also consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of and business outlook for the investee, including industry and sector performance, changes in technology, and operational and financing cash flow factors. once a decline in fair value is determined to be other-than-temporary, an impairment charge is recorded to other income (expense) and a new cost basis in the investment is established. if market, industry, and/or investee conditions deteriorate, we may incur future impairments.  goodwill  goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level (operating segment or one level below an operating segment) on an annual basis (may 1 for us) and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. these events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate, legal factors, operating performance indicators, competition, or sale or disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit. application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment, including the identification of reporting units, assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units, assignment of goodwill to reporting units, and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit. the fair value of each reporting unit is estimated using a discounted cash flow methodology. this analysis requires significant judgments, including estimation of future cash flows, which is dependent on internal forecasts, estimation of the long-term rate of growth for our business, estimation of the useful life over which cash flows will occur, and determination of our weighted average cost of capital. changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and goodwill impairment for each reporting unit. we allocate goodwill to reporting units based on the reporting unit expected to benefit from the business combination. we evaluate our reporting units on an annual basis and, if necessary, reassign goodwill using a relative fair value allocation approach.  in addition to the impairment test performed on may\u00a01, 2010, we performed an interim impairment analysis of our online services division goodwill balance during the first quarter of fiscal year 2010 in connection with the disposal of razorfish. no impairment of goodwill was identified.  research and development costs  costs incurred internally in researching and developing a computer software product are charged to expense until technological feasibility has been established for the product. once technological feasibility is established, all software costs are capitalized until the product is available for general release to customers. judgment is required in determining when technological feasibility of a product is established. we have determined that technological feasibility for our software products is reached after all high-risk development issues have been resolved through coding and testing. generally, this occurs shortly before the products are released to manufacturing. the amortization of these costs is included in cost of revenue over the estimated life of the products.  legal and other contingencies  the outcomes of legal proceedings and claims brought against us are subject to significant uncertainty. an estimated loss from a loss contingency such as a legal proceeding or claim is accrued by a charge to income if it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. disclosure of a contingency is required if there is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss has been incurred. in determining whether a loss should be accrued we evaluate, among other factors, the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss. changes in these factors could materially impact our financial statements.  income taxes  the objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entity\u0092s financial statements or tax returns. we recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax  \u00a0 40  table of contents   \u00a0  part ii  item 7  \u00a0  \u00a0  position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position should be measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. accounting literature also provides guidance on derecognition of income tax assets and liabilities, classification of current and deferred income tax assets and liabilities, accounting for interest and penalties associated with tax positions, and income tax disclosures. judgment is required in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns. variations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could materially impact our financial statements.  stock-based compensation  stock-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period. determining the fair value of stock-based awards at the grant date requires judgment, including estimating expected dividends. in addition, judgment is also required in estimating the amount of stock-based awards that are expected to be forfeited. if actual results differ significantly from these estimates, stock-based compensation expense and our results of operations could be impacted.  product warranties  we provide for the estimated costs of hardware and software warranties at the time the related revenue is recognized. for hardware warranty, we estimate the costs based on historical and projected product failure rates, historical and projected repair costs, and knowledge of specific product failures (if any). the specific hardware warranty terms and conditions vary depending upon the product sold and country in which we do business, but generally include parts and labor over a period generally ranging from 90\u00a0days to three years. for software warranty, we estimate the costs to provide bug fixes, such as security patches, over the life of the software. we regularly reevaluate our estimates to assess the adequacy of the recorded warranty liabilities and adjust the amounts as necessary.  \u00a0 41  table of contents   \u00a0  part ii  item 7  \u00a0  \u00a0 statement of management\u0092s responsibility for financial statements  management is responsible for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements and related information that are presented in this report. the consolidated financial statements, which include amounts based on management\u0092s estimates and judgments, have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america.  the company designs and maintains accounting and internal control systems to provide reasonable assurance at reasonable cost that assets are safeguarded against loss from unauthorized use or disposition, and that the financial records are reliable for preparing financial statements and maintaining accountability for assets. these systems are augmented by written policies, an organizational structure providing division of responsibilities, careful selection and training of qualified personnel, and a program of internal audits.  the company engaged deloitte\u00a0& touche llp, an independent registered public accounting firm, to audit and render an opinion on the consolidated financial statements and internal control over financial reporting in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board (united states).  the board of directors, through its audit committee, consisting solely of independent directors of the company, meets periodically with management, internal auditors, and our independent registered public accounting firm to ensure that each is meeting its responsibilities and to discuss matters concerning internal controls and financial reporting. deloitte\u00a0& touche llp and the internal auditors each have full and free access to the audit committee.  \u00a0  42  table of contents   \u00a0  part ii  item 7a  \u00a0  \u00a0 item\u00a07a.\u00a0quantative and qualitative disclosures about market risk  risks  we are

and return to correlate with these indices.  commodity.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0we use broad-based commodity exposures to enhance portfolio returns and facilitate portfolio diversification. our investment portfolio has exposure to a variety of commodities, including precious metals, energy, and grain. we manage these exposures relative to global commodity indices and expect their economic risk and return to correlate with these indices.  value-at-risk  we use a value-at-risk (\u0093var\u0094) model to estimate and quantify our market risks. var is the expected loss, for a given confidence level, in the fair value of our portfolio due to adverse market movements over a defined time horizon. the var model is not intended to represent actual losses in fair value, including determinations of other-than-temporary losses in fair value in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states (\u0093u.s. gaap\u0094), but is used as a risk estimation and management tool. the distribution of the potential changes in total market value of all holdings is computed based on the historical volatilities and correlations among foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, equity prices, and commodity prices, assuming normal market conditions.  the var is calculated as the total loss that will not be exceeded at the 97.5 percentile confidence level or, alternatively stated, the losses could exceed the var in 25 out of 1,000 cases. several risk factors are not captured in the model, including liquidity risk, operational risk, and legal risk.  the following table sets forth the one-day var for substantially all of our positions as of june\u00a030, 2010 and 2009 and for the year ended june\u00a030, 2010:  \u00a0  total one-day var for the combined risk categories was $235 million at june\u00a030, 2010 and $211 million at june\u00a030, 2009. the total var is 26% less at june\u00a030, 2010, and 25% less at june\u00a030, 2009, than the sum of the separate risk categories in the above table due to the diversification benefit of the combination of risks.  \u00a0 43  table of contents   \u00a0  part ii  item 8  \u00a0  \u00a0 cash

 table of contents   \u00a0  part ii  item 8  \u00a0  \u00a0 notes to financial statements  note 1 - accounting policies  accounting principles  the financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america.  principles of consolidation  the financial statements include the accounts of microsoft corporation and its subsidiaries. intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated. equity investments through which we exercise significant influence over but do not control the investee and are not the primary beneficiary of the investee\u0092s activities are accounted for using the equity method. investments through which we are not able to exercise significant influence over the investee and which do not have readily determinable fair values are accounted for under the cost method.  estimates and assumptions  preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. examples include: estimates of loss contingencies, product warranties, product life cycles, product returns, and stock-based compensation forfeiture rates; assumptions such as the elements comprising a software arrangement, including the distinction between upgrades/enhancements and new products; when technological feasibility is achieved for our products; the potential outcome of future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns; estimating the fair value and/or goodwill impairment for our reporting units; and determining when investment impairments are other-than-temporary. actual results and outcomes may differ from management\u0092s estimates and assumptions.  foreign currencies  assets and liabilities recorded in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rate on the balance sheet date. revenue and expenses are translated at average rates of exchange prevailing during the year. translation adjustments resulting from this process are recorded to other comprehensive income (\u0093oci\u0094).  revenue recognition  revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the fee is fixed or determinable, and collectibility is probable.  revenue for retail packaged products, products licensed to original equipment manufacturers (\u0093oems\u0094), and perpetual licenses under certain volume licensing programs generally is recognized as products are shipped or made available. a portion of the revenue related to windows xp is deferred due to the right to receive unspecified upgrades/enhancements of microsoft internet explorer on a when-and-if-available basis. the amount of revenue allocated to the unspecified upgrade/enhancement rights for microsoft internet explorer is based on the vendor-specific objective evidence of fair value for those elements using the residual method or relative fair value method and the deferred revenue is recognized ratably on a straight-line basis over the windows xp life cycle. revenue related to windows vista and windows 7 is not subject to a similar deferral because there are no significant undelivered elements. revenue for products under the technology guarantee programs, which provide free or significantly discounted rights to use upcoming new versions of a software product if an end user licenses existing versions of the product during the eligibility period, is allocated between existing product and the new product, and revenue allocated to the new product is deferred until that version is delivered. the revenue allocation is based on vendor-specific objective evidence of fair value of both products.  \u00a0 48  table of contents   \u00a0  part ii  item 8  \u00a0  \u00a0 certain multi-year licensing arrangements include a perpetual license for current products combined with rights to receive future versions of software products on a when-and-if-available basis (\u0093software assurance\u0094) and are accounted for as subscriptions, with billings recorded as unearned revenue and recognized as revenue ratably over the billing coverage period. revenue from certain arrangements that allow for the use of a product or service over a period of time without taking possession of software are also accounted for as subscriptions.  revenue related to our xbox 360 gaming and entertainment console, games published by us, and other hardware components is generally recognized when ownership is transferred to the retailers. revenue related to games published by third parties for use on the xbox 360 platform is recognized when games are manufactured by the game publishers. display advertising revenue is recognized as advertisements are displayed. search advertising revenue is recognized when the ad appears in the search results or when the action necessary to earn the revenue has been completed. consulting services revenue is recognized as services are rendered, generally based on the negotiated hourly rate in the consulting arrangement and the number of hours worked during the period. consulting revenue for fixed-price services arrangements is recognized as services are provided.  revenue generally is recognized net of any taxes collected from customers and subsequently remitted to governmental authorities.  cost of revenue  cost of revenue includes; manufacturing and distribution costs for products sold and programs licensed; operating costs related to product support service centers and product distribution centers; costs incurred to include software on pcs sold by oems, to drive traffic to our web sites and to acquire online advertising space (\u0093traffic acquisition costs\u0094); costs incurred to support and maintain internet-based products and services; warranty costs; inventory valuation adjustments; costs associated with the delivery of consulting services; and the amortization of capitalized research and development costs. capitalized research and development costs are amortized over the estimated lives of the products.  product warranty  we provide for the estimated costs of fulfilling our obligations under hardware and software warranties at the time the related revenue is recognized. for hardware warranties, we estimate the costs based on historical and projected product failure rates, historical and projected repair costs, and knowledge of specific product failures (if any). the specific hardware warranty terms and conditions vary depending upon the product sold and the country in which we do business, but generally include parts and labor over a period generally ranging from 90\u00a0days to three years. for software warranties, we estimate the costs to provide bug fixes, such as security patches, over the estimated life of the software. we regularly reevaluate our estimates to assess the adequacy of the recorded warranty liabilities and adjust the amounts as necessary.  research and development  research and development expenses include payroll, employee benefits, stock-based compensation expense, and other headcount-related expenses associated with product development. research and development expenses also include third-party development and programming costs, localization costs incurred to translate software for international markets, and the amortization of purchased software code and services content. such costs related to software development are included in research and development expense until the point that technological feasibility is reached, which for our software products, is generally shortly before the products are released to manufacturing. once technological feasibility is reached, such costs are capitalized and amortized to cost of revenue over the estimated lives of the products.  \u00a0 49  table of contents   \u00a0  part ii  item 8  \u00a0  \u00a0 sales and marketing  sales and marketing expenses include payroll, employee benefits, stock-based compensation, and other headcount-related expenses associated with sales and marketing personnel, and the costs of advertising, promotions, trade shows, seminars, and other programs. advertising costs are expensed as incurred. advertising expense was $1.6 billion, $1.4 billion, and $1.2 billion in fiscal years 2010, 2009, and 2008, respectively.  employee severance  we record employee severance when a specific plan has been approved by management, the plan has been communicated to employees, and it is unlikely that significant changes will be made to the plan.  stock-based compensation  we measure stock-based compensation cost at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and recognize it as expense over the applicable vesting period of the stock award (generally four to five years) using the straight-line method.  employee stock purchase plan  shares of our common stock may be purchased by employees at three-month intervals at 90% of the fair market value of the stock on the last day of each three-month period. compensation expense for the employee stock purchase plan is measured as the discount the employee is entitled to upon purchase and is recognized in the period of purchase.  income taxes  income tax expense includes u.s. and international income taxes, the provision for u.s. taxes on undistributed earnings of international subsidiaries not deemed to be permanently invested and interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions. certain income and expenses are not reported in tax returns and financial statements in the same year. the tax effect of such temporary differences is reported as deferred income taxes.  fair value measurements  we account for certain assets and liabilities at fair value. the hierarchy below lists three levels of fair value based on the extent to which inputs used in measuring fair value are observable in the market.\u00a0we categorize each of our fair value measurements in one of these three levels based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. these levels are:  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 50  table of contents   \u00a0  part ii  item 8  \u00a0  \u00a0 \u00a0 we measure certain assets, including our cost and equity method investments, at fair value on a nonrecurring basis when they are deemed to be other-than-temporarily impaired. the fair values of these investments are determined based on valuation techniques using the best information available, and may include quoted market prices, market comparables, and discounted cash flow projections.  our current financial liabilities, including our short-term debt, have fair values that approximate their carrying values. our long-term financial liabilities consist of long-term debt which is recorded on the balance sheet at issuance price less unamortized discount.  financial instruments  we consider all highly liquid interest-earning investments with a maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase to be cash equivalents. the fair values of these investments approximate their carrying values. in general, investments with original maturities of greater than three months and remaining maturities of less than one year are classified as short-term investments. investments with maturities beyond one year may be classified as short-term based on their highly liquid nature and because such marketable securities represent the investment of cash that is available for current operations. all cash equivalents and short-term investments are classified as available-for-sale and realized gains and losses are recorded using the specific identification method. changes in market value, excluding other-than-temporary impairments, are reflected in oci.  equity and other investments classified as long-term include both debt and equity instruments. debt and publicly-traded equity securities are classified as available-for-sale and realized gains and losses are recorded using the specific identification method. changes in market value, excluding other-than-temporary impairments, are reflected in oci. common and preferred stock and other investments that are restricted for more than one year or are not publicly traded are recorded at cost or using the equity method.  we lend certain fixed-income and equity securities to increase investment returns. the loaned securities continue to be carried as investments on our balance sheet. cash and/or security interests are received as collateral for the loan securities with the amount determined based upon the underlying security lent and the creditworthiness of the borrower. cash received is recorded as an asset with a corresponding liability.  investments are considered to be impaired when a decline in fair value is judged to be other-than-temporary. fair value is calculated based on publicly available market information or other estimates determined by management. we employ a systematic methodology on a quarterly basis that considers available quantitative and qualitative evidence in evaluating potential impairment of our investments. if the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value, we evaluate, among other factors, general market conditions, credit quality of debt instrument issuers, the duration and extent to which the fair value is less than cost, and for equity securities, our intent and ability to hold, or plans to sell,  \u00a0 51  table of contents   \u00a0  part ii  item 8  \u00a0  \u00a0  the investment. for fixed income securities, we also evaluate whether we have plans to sell the security or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery. we also consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of and business outlook for the investee, including industry and sector performance, changes in technology, and operational and financing cash flow factors. once a decline in fair value is determined to be other-than-temporary, an impairment charge is recorded to other income (expense) and a new cost basis in the investment is established.  derivative instruments are recognized as either assets or liabilities and are measured at fair value. the accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation.  for a derivative instrument designated as a fair-value hedge, the gain (loss) is recognized in earnings in the period of change together with the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item attributed to the risk being hedged. for options designated as fair-value hedges, changes in the time value are excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and are recognized in earnings.  for derivative instruments designated as cash-flow hedges, the effective portion of the derivative\u0092s gain (loss) is initially reported as a component of oci and is subsequently recognized in earnings when the hedged exposure is recognized in earnings. for options designated as cash-flow hedges, changes in the time value are excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and are recognized in earnings. gains (losses) on derivatives representing either hedge components excluded from the assessment of effectiveness or hedge ineffectiveness are recognized in earnings.  for derivative instruments that are not designated as hedges, gains (losses) from changes in fair values are primarily recognized in other income (expense). other than those derivatives entered into for investment purposes, such as commodity contracts, the gains (losses) are generally economically offset by unrealized gains (losses) in the underlying available-for-sale securities, which are recorded as a component of oci until the securities are sold or other-than-temporarily impaired, at which time the amounts are moved from oci into other income (expense).  allowance for doubtful accounts  the allowance for doubtful accounts reflects our best estimate of probable losses inherent in the accounts receivable balance. we determine the allowance based on known troubled accounts, historical experience, and other currently available evidence. activity in the allowance for doubtful accounts was as follows:  \u00a0 inventories  inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market, using the average cost method. cost includes materials, labor, and manufacturing overhead related to the purchase and production of inventories. we regularly review inventory quantities on hand, future purchase commitments with our suppliers, and the estimated utility of our inventory. if our review indicates a reduction in utility below carrying value, we reduce our inventory to a new cost basis through a charge to cost of revenue.  \u00a0 52  table of contents   \u00a0  part ii  item 8  \u00a0  \u00a0 property and equipment  property and equipment is stated at cost and depreciated using the straight-line method over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the asset or the lease term. the estimated useful lives of our property and equipment are generally as follows: computer software developed or acquired for internal use, three years; computer equipment, two to three years; buildings and improvements, five to 15 years; leasehold improvements, two to 10 years; and furniture and equipment, one to five years. land is not depreciated.  goodwill  goodwill is tested for impairment using a fair-value-based approach on an annual basis (may 1 for us) and between annual tests if indicators of potential impairment exist.  intangible assets  all of our intangible assets are subject to amortization and are amortized using the straight-line method over their estimated period of benefit, ranging from one to 10 years. we evaluate the recoverability of intangible assets periodically by taking into account events or circumstances that may warrant revised estimates of useful lives or that indicate the asset may be impaired.  recently issued accounting standards  recently adopted accounting pronouncements  in january 2010, the financial accounting standards board (\u0093fasb\u0094) issued guidance to amend the disclosure requirements related to recurring and nonrecurring fair value measurements.\u00a0the guidance requires new disclosures on the transfers of assets and liabilities between level 1 (quoted prices in active market for identical assets or liabilities) and level 2 (significant other observable inputs) of the fair value measurement hierarchy, including the reasons and the timing of the transfers.\u00a0additionally, the guidance requires a roll forward of activities on purchases, sales, issuance, and settlements of the assets and liabilities measured using significant unobservable inputs (level 3 fair value measurements). the guidance became effective for us with the reporting period beginning january\u00a01, 2010, except for the disclosure on the roll forward activities for level 3 fair value measurements, which will become effective for us with the reporting period beginning july\u00a01, 2011. other than requiring additional disclosures, adoption of this new guidance did not have a material impact on our financial statements. see note 6 \u0096 fair value measurements.  on july\u00a01, 2009, we adopted guidance issued by the fasb on business combinations. the guidance retains the fundamental requirements that the acquisition method of accounting (previously referred to as the purchase method of accounting) be used for all business combinations, but requires a number of changes, including changes in the way assets and liabilities are recognized and measured as a result of business combinations. it also requires the capitalization of in-process research and development at fair value and requires the expensing of acquisition-related costs as incurred. we have applied this guidance to business combinations completed since july\u00a01, 2009.  on july\u00a01, 2009, we adopted guidance issued by the fasb that changes the accounting and reporting for non-controlling interests. non-controlling interests are to be reported as a component of equity separate from the parent\u0092s equity, and purchases or sales of equity interests that do not result in a change in control are to be accounted for as equity transactions. in addition, net income attributable to a non-controlling interest is to be included in net income and, upon a loss of control, the interest sold, as well as any interest retained, is to be recorded at fair value with any gain or loss recognized in net income. adoption of the new guidance did not have a material impact on our financial statements.  on july\u00a01, 2009, we adopted guidance on fair value measurement for nonfinancial assets and liabilities, except for items that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis (at least annually). adoption of the new guidance did not have a material impact on our financial statements.  \u00a0 53  table of contents   \u00a0  part ii  item 8  \u00a0  \u00a0 recent accounting pronouncements not yet adopted  in october 2009, the fasb issued guidance on revenue recognition that will become effective for us beginning july\u00a01, 2010. under the new guidance on arrangements that include software elements, tangible products that have software components that are essential to the functionality of the tangible product will no longer be within the scope of the software revenue recognition guidance, and software-enabled products will now be subject to other relevant revenue recognition guidance. additionally, the fasb issued guidance on revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables that are outside the scope of the software revenue recognition guidance. under the new guidance, when vendor specific objective evidence or third party evidence for deliverables in an arrangement cannot be determined, a best estimate of the selling price is required to separate deliverables and allocate arrangement consideration using the relative selling price method. the new guidance includes new disclosure requirements on how the application of the relative selling price method affects the timing and amount of revenue recognition. we believe adoption of this new guidance will not have a material impact on our financial statements.  in june 2009, the fasb issued guidance on the consolidation of variable interest entities, which is effective for us beginning july\u00a01, 2010. the new guidance requires revised evaluations of whether entities represent variable interest entities, ongoing assessments of control over such entities, and additional disclosures for variable interests. we believe adoption of this new guidance will not have a material impact on our financial statements.  note 2 - earnings per share  basic earnings per share is computed based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. diluted earnings per share is computed based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock plus the effect of dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period using the treasury stock method. dilutive potential common shares include outstanding stock options, stock awards, and shared performance stock awards. the components of basic and diluted earnings per share are as follows:  \u00a0  for fiscal years 2010, 2009, and 2008, 28\u00a0million, 342\u00a0million, and 91\u00a0million shares, respectively, were attributable to outstanding stock-based awards and were excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per share because their inclusion would have been anti-dilutive.  in june 2010, we issued $1.25 billion of zero-coupon debt securities that are convertible into shares of our common stock if certain conditions are met.\u00a0shares of common stock into which the debt could convert were excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per share because their inclusion would have been anti-dilutive. see also note\u00a012\u00a0\u0096 debt.  \u00a0 54  table of contents   \u00a0  part ii  item 8  \u00a0  \u00a0 note 3 - other income (expense)  the components of other income (expense) were as follows:  \u00a0 other-than-temporary impairments, which are included in net recognized gains (losses) on investments in the table above, were $69 million, $862 million, and $312 million in fiscal years 2010, 2009, and 2008, respectively. realized gains and losses from sales of available-for-sale securities (excluding other-than-temporary impairments) were $605 million and $188 million, respectively, in fiscal year 2010, $1.6 billion and $897 million, respectively, in fiscal year 2009, and $751 million and $93 million, respectively, in fiscal year 2008.  note 4 - investments  investment components  the components of investments, including associated derivatives, were as follows:  \u00a0 \u00a0 55  table of contents   \u00a0  part ii  item 8  \u00a0  \u00a0 unrealized losses on investments  investments with continuous unrealized losses for less than 12 months and 12 months or greater and their related fair values were as follows:  \u00a0 \u00a0 56  table of contents   \u00a0  part ii  item 8  \u00a0  \u00a0 unrealized losses from fixed-income securities are primarily attributable to changes in interest rates. unrealized losses from domestic and international equities are due to market price movements. management does not believe any remaining unrealized losses represent other-than-temporary impairments based on our evaluation of available evidence as of june\u00a030, 2010.  at june\u00a030, 2010 and 2009, the recorded bases and estimated fair values of common and preferred stock and other investments that are restricted for more than one year or are not publicly traded were $216 million and $204 million, respectively.  debt investment maturities  \u00a0 note 5 - derivatives  we use derivative instruments to manage risks related to foreign currencies, equity prices, interest rates, and credit; to enhance investment returns; and to facilitate portfolio diversification. our objectives for holding derivatives include reducing, eliminating, and efficiently managing the economic impact of these exposures as effectively as possible. our derivative programs include strategies that both qualify and do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment. all notional amounts presented below are measured in u.s. currency equivalents.  foreign currency  certain forecasted transactions, assets, and liabilities are exposed to foreign currency risk. we monitor our foreign currency exposures daily to maximize the economic effectiveness of our foreign currency hedge positions. option and forward contracts are used to hedge a portion of forecasted international revenue for up to three years in the future and are designated as cash-flow hedging instruments. principal currencies hedged include the euro, japanese yen, british pound, and canadian dollar. as of june\u00a030, 2010 and 2009, the total notional amounts of these foreign exchange contracts sold were $9.3 billion and $7.2 billion, respectively.\u00a0foreign currency risks related to certain non-u.s. dollar denominated securities are hedged using foreign exchange forward contracts that are designated as fair-value hedging instruments. as of june\u00a030, 2010 and 2009, the total notional amounts of these foreign exchange contracts sold were $523 million and $3.5 billion, respectively.\u00a0certain options and forwards not designated as hedging instruments are also used to manage the variability in exchange rates on accounts receivable, cash, and intercompany positions, and to manage other foreign currency exposures.\u00a0as of june\u00a030, 2010, the total notional amounts of these foreign exchange contracts purchased and sold were $7.8 billion and $5.3 billion, respectively. as of june\u00a030, 2009, the total notional amounts of these foreign exchange contracts purchased and sold were $3.2 billion and $3.6 billion, respectively.  equity  securities held in our equity and other investments portfolio are subject to market price risk.\u00a0market price risk is managed relative to broad-based global and domestic equity indices using certain convertible preferred investments, options, futures, and swap contracts not designated as hedging instruments. from time to time, to hedge our price risk, we may use and designate equity derivatives as hedging instruments, including puts, calls, swaps, and forwards.\u00a0as of june\u00a030, 2010, the total notional amounts of designated and non-designated equity contracts purchased and sold were $918 million and $472 million, respectively. as of june\u00a030, 2009, the total notional amounts of designated and non-designated equity contracts purchased and sold were immaterial.  \u00a0 57  table of contents   \u00a0  part ii  item 8  \u00a0  \u00a0 interest rate  securities held in our fixed-income portfolio are subject to different interest rate risks based on their maturities. we manage the average maturity of our fixed-income portfolio to achieve economic returns that correlate to certain broad-based fixed-income indices using exchange-traded option and futures contracts and over-the-counter swap and option contracts, none of which are designated as hedging instruments. as of june\u00a030, 2010, the total notional amounts of fixed-interest rate contracts purchased and sold were $3.1 billion and $1.8 billion, respectively. as of june\u00a030, 2009, the total notional amounts of fixed-interest rate contracts purchased and sold were $2.7 billion and $456 million, respectively. in addition, we use \u0093to be announced\u0094 forward purchase commitments of mortgage-backed assets to gain exposure to agency mortgage-backed securities.\u00a0these meet the definition of a derivative instrument in cases where physical delivery of the assets is not taken at the earliest available delivery date. as of june\u00a030, 2010 and 2009, the total notional derivative amount of mortgage contracts purchased were immaterial and $1.3 billion, respectively.  credit  our fixed-income portfolio is diversified and consists primarily of investment-grade securities. we use credit default swap contracts, not designated as hedging instruments, to manage credit exposures relative to broad-based indices and to facilitate portfolio diversification. we use credit default swaps as they are a low cost method of managing exposure to individual credit risks or groups of credit risks. as of june\u00a030, 2010 and 2009, the total notional amounts of credit contracts purchased and sold were immaterial.  commodity  we use broad-based commodity exposures to enhance portfolio returns and to facilitate portfolio diversification. we use swap, futures and option contracts, not designated as hedging instruments, to generate and manage exposures to broad-based commodity indices. we use derivatives on commodities as they can be low-cost alternatives to the purchase and storage of a variety of commodities, including, but not limited to, precious metals, energy, and grain. as of june\u00a030, 2010, the total notional amounts of commodity contracts purchased and sold were $1.1 billion and $376 million, respectively. as of june\u00a030, 2009, the total notional amounts of commodity contracts purchased and sold were $543 million and $33 million, respectively.  credit-risk-related contingent features  certain of our counterparty agreements for derivative instruments contain provisions that require our issued and outstanding long-term unsecured debt to maintain an investment grade credit rating and require us to maintain a minimum liquidity of $1.0 billion. to the extent we fail to meet these requirements, we will be required to post collateral, similar to the standard convention related to over-the-counter derivatives. as of june\u00a030, 2010, our long-term unsecured debt rating was aaa, and cash investments were in excess of $1.0 billion. as a result, no collateral is required to be posted.  \u00a0 58  table of contents   \u00a0  part ii  item 8  \u00a0  \u00a0 fair values of derivative instruments  following are the gross fair values of derivative instruments held at june\u00a030, 2010 and 2009, excluding the impact of netting derivative assets and liabilities when a legally enforceable master netting agreement exists and fair value adjustments related to our own credit risk and counterparty credit risk:  \u00a0

\u00a0 cash-flow hedges  we recognized the following gains (losses) related to foreign exchange contracts designated as cash flow hedges (our only cash flow hedges during the period):  \u00a0  we estimate that $496 million of net derivative gains included in oci will be reclassified into earnings within the next 12 months. no significant amounts of gains (losses) were reclassified from oci into earnings as a result of forecasted transactions that failed to occur during fiscal year 2010.  non-designated derivatives  gains (losses) from changes in fair values of derivatives that are not designated as hedges are primarily recognized in other income (expense). these amounts are shown in the table below, with the exception of gains (losses) on derivatives presented in income statement line items other than other income (expense), which were immaterial for the fiscal years 2010 and 2009. other than those derivatives entered into for investment purposes, such as commodity contracts, the gains (losses) below are generally economically offset by unrealized gains (losses) in the underlying available-for-sale securities.  \u00a0 \u00a0 61  table of contents   \u00a0  part ii  item 8  \u00a0  \u00a0 note 6 - fair value measurements  assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis  the following tables present the fair value of our financial instruments that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis:  \u00a0  \u00a0 \u00a0 62  table of contents   \u00a0  part ii  item 8  \u00a0  \u00a0 the table below reconciles the total net fair value of assets above to the balance sheet presentation of these same assets in note 4 \u0096 investments for june\u00a030, 2010 and 2009.  \u00a0 changes in financial instruments measured at level 3 fair value on a recurring basis  the following tables present the changes during the fiscal years 2010 and 2009 in our level 3 financial instruments that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis. the majority of these instruments consist of investment securities classified as available-for-sale with changes in fair value included in oci.  \u00a0  \u00a0 63  table of contents   \u00a0  part ii  item 8  \u00a0  \u00a0 assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis  during fiscal years 2010 and 2009, impairment charges of $5 million and $86 million, respectively, were recognized for certain investments measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis, as the decline in their respective fair values below their cost was determined to be other than temporary in all instances. at june\u00a030, 2010 and 2009, the fair values of the common and preferred stocks that we held that were required to be measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis were $0 and $164 million, respectively.  note 7 - inventories  the components of inventories were as follows:  \u00a0 note 8 - property and equipment  the components of property and equipment were as follows:  \u00a0 during fiscal years 2010, 2009, and 2008, depreciation expense was $1.8 billion, $1.7 billion, and $1.4 billion, respectively.  note 9 - business combinations  during fiscal year 2010, we acquired five entities for total consideration of $267 million, substantially all of which was paid in cash. during this period, we also sold three entities for total consideration of $600 million, including razorfish in the second quarter of fiscal year 2010. these entities have been included in or removed from our consolidated results of operations since their acquisition or sale dates, respectively. pro forma results of operations have not been presented because the effects of these business combinations, individually and in the aggregate, were not material to our consolidated results of operations.  \u00a0 64  table of contents   \u00a0  part ii  item 8  \u00a0  \u00a0 note 10 - goodwill  changes in the carrying amount of goodwill for fiscal years 2010 and 2009 by segment were as follows:  \u00a0 none of the amounts recorded as goodwill are expected to be deductible for tax purposes. the measurement period for purchase price allocations ends as soon as information on the facts and circumstances becomes available, but will not exceed 12 months. adjustments in the purchase price allocation may require a recasting of the amounts allocated to goodwill retroactive to the period in which the acquisition occurred. any change in the goodwill amounts resulting from foreign currency translations are presented as \u0093other\u0094 in the above table. also included within \u0093other\u0094 for fiscal year 2010 is $285 million of goodwill associated with business dispositions. see also note 9 \u0096 business combinations.  we test goodwill for impairment annually on may\u00a01 at the reporting unit level using a fair value approach. no impairment of goodwill was identified as of may\u00a01, 2010. in connection with the disposal of razorfish, we performed an interim impairment analysis of our online services division goodwill balance during the first quarter of fiscal year 2010. no impairment of goodwill was identified.  note 11 - intangible assets  the components of intangible assets, all of which are finite-lived, were as follows:  \u00a0 we estimate that we have no significant residual value related to our intangible assets. no material impairments of intangible assets were identified during any of the periods presented.  \u00a0 65  table of contents   \u00a0  part ii  item 8  \u00a0  \u00a0 the components of intangible assets acquired during fiscal years 2010 and 2009 were as follows:  \u00a0 intangible assets amortization expense was $707 million, $591 million, and $472 million for fiscal years 2010, 2009, and 2008, respectively. the following table outlines the estimated future amortization expense related to intangible assets held at june\u00a030, 2010:  \u00a0 note 12 - debt  in september 2008, our board of directors authorized debt financings of up to $6.0 billion. as of june\u00a030, 2010, we had $6.0 billion of issued and outstanding debt comprised of $1.0 billion of commercial paper and $5.0 billion of long-term debt, including $1.25 billion of convertible debt. cash paid for interest on our debt for fiscal year 2010 was $145 million. no cash was paid for interest on our debt for fiscal years 2009 and 2008.  short-term debt  as of june\u00a030, 2010, our $1.0 billion of commercial paper issued and outstanding had a weighted average interest rate, including issuance costs, of 0.20% and maturities of 22 to 216 days. the estimated fair value of this commercial paper approximates its carrying value.  in november 2009, we replaced our $2.0 billion and $1.0 billion credit facilities with a $2.25 billion 364-day credit facility, which expires on november\u00a05, 2010. this facility serves as a back-up for our commercial paper program. in june 2010, we reduced the size of our credit facility from $2.25 billion to $1.0 billion due to the reduction in commercial paper outstanding. as of june\u00a030, 2010, we were in compliance with the financial covenant in the credit facility agreement, which requires a coverage ratio be maintained of at least three times earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization to interest expense.\u00a0no amounts were drawn against the credit facility during any of the periods presented.  long-term debt  notes  as of june\u00a030, 2010, we had issued and outstanding $3.75 billion of debt securities as illustrated in the table below (collectively \u0093the notes\u0094). interest on the notes is payable semi-annually on june\u00a01 and december\u00a01 of each year, to holders of record on the preceding may\u00a015 and november\u00a015.\u00a0the notes are senior unsecured obligations and rank equally with our other unsecured and unsubordinated debt outstanding.  \u00a0 66  table of contents   \u00a0  part ii  item 8  \u00a0  \u00a0 convertible debt  in june 2010, we issued $1.25 billion of zero coupon convertible unsecured debt due on june\u00a015, 2013 in a private placement offering. proceeds from the offering were $1.24 billion, net of fees and expenses which were capitalized. the majority of the proceeds were used to repay outstanding commercial paper, leaving $1.0 billion of commercial paper outstanding as of june\u00a030, 2010. each $1,000 principal amount of notes is convertible into 29.94 shares of microsoft common stock at a conversion price of $33.40 per share.  prior to march\u00a015, 2013, the notes will be convertible, only in certain circumstances, into cash and, if applicable, cash, shares of microsoft\u0092s common stock or a combination thereof, at our election. on or after march\u00a015, 2013, the notes will be convertible at any time. upon conversion, we will pay cash up to the aggregate principal amount of the notes and pay or deliver cash, shares of our common stock or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock, at our election.  because the convertible debt may be wholly or partially settled in cash, we are required to separately account for the liability and equity components of the notes in a manner that reflects our nonconvertible debt borrowing rate when interest costs are recognized in subsequent periods. the net proceeds of $1.24 billion were allocated between debt for $1.18 billion and stockholders\u0092 equity for $58 million with the portion in stockholders\u0092 equity representing the fair value of the option to convert the debt.  in connection with the issuance of the notes, we entered into capped call transactions with certain option counterparties who are initial purchasers of the notes or their affiliates. the capped call transactions are expected to reduce potential dilution of earnings per share upon conversion of the notes. under the capped call transactions, we purchased from the option counterparties capped call options that in the aggregate relate to the total number of shares of our common stock underlying the notes, with a strike price equal to the conversion price of the notes and with a cap price equal to $37.16. the purchased capped calls were valued at $40 million and recorded to stockholders\u0092 equity.  as of june\u00a030, 2010, the total carrying value and estimated fair value of our long-term debt, including convertible debt, were $4.94 billion and $5.21 billion, respectively. the estimate of fair value is based on quoted prices for our publicly-traded debt as of june\u00a030, 2010, as applicable. the effective interest yields of the notes due in 2014, 2019, and 2039 were 3.00%, 4.29%, and 5.22%, respectively, at june\u00a030, 2010. the effective interest yield of the convertible debt due in 2013 is 1.85% at june\u00a030, 2010 and the coupon interest rate is zero percent.  the components of long-term debt as of june\u00a030, 2010 were as follows:  \u00a0 maturities of long-term debt for the next five years are as follows:  \u00a0 \u00a0 67  table of contents   \u00a0  part ii  item 8  \u00a0  \u00a0 note 13 - income taxes  the components of the provision for income taxes were as follows:  \u00a0 u.s. and international components of income before income taxes were as follows:  \u00a0 the items accounting for the difference between income taxes computed at the federal statutory rate and the provision for income taxes were as follows:  \u00a0 in general, other reconciling items consist of interest, u.s. state income taxes, domestic production deductions, and research credits. in fiscal years 2010, 2009 and 2008, there were no individually significant other reconciling items.  \u00a0 68  table of contents   \u00a0  part ii  item 8  \u00a0  \u00a0 the components of the deferred income tax assets and liabilities were as follows:  \u00a0 deferred income tax balances reflect the effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases and are stated at enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when the taxes are actually paid or recovered.  we have not provided deferred u.s. income taxes or foreign withholding taxes on temporary differences of approximately $29.5 billion resulting from earnings for certain non-u.s. subsidiaries which are permanently reinvested outside the u.s. the unrecognized deferred tax liability associated with these temporary differences is approximately $9.2 billion.  income taxes paid were $4.1 billion, $6.6 billion, and $5.4 billion in fiscal years 2010, 2009, and 2008, respectively.  uncertain tax positions  as of june\u00a030, 2010, we had $6.5 billion of unrecognized tax benefits of which $5.6 billion, if recognized, would affect our effective tax rate. as of june\u00a030, 2009, we had $5.4 billion of unrecognized tax benefits of which $4.4 billion, if recognized, would affect our effective tax rate.  interest on unrecognized tax benefits was $193 million, $230 million, and $121 million in fiscal years 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. as of june\u00a030, 2010, 2009 and 2008, we had accrued interest related to uncertain tax positions of $747 million, $554 million, and $324 million, respectively, net of federal income tax benefits.  \u00a0 69  table of contents   \u00a0  part ii  item 8  \u00a0  \u00a0 the aggregate changes in the balance of unrecognized tax benefits were as follows:  \u00a0 we are under audit by the irs for the tax years 2004-2006.\u00a0we do not believe it is reasonably possible that the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits will significantly increase or decrease within the next 12 months as we do not believe the examination will be concluded within the next 12 months.  we are subject to income tax in many jurisdictions outside the u.s., and certain jurisdictions are under audit by local tax authorities. the resolutions of these audits are not expected to be material to our financial statements.  note 14 - unearned revenue  unearned revenue comprises mainly unearned revenue from volume licensing programs, as well as payments for undelivered elements and for other offerings for which we earn the revenue when we provide the service or software or otherwise meet the revenue recognition criteria.  volume licensing programs  unearned revenue from volume licensing programs represents customer billings for multi-year licensing arrangements paid either at inception of the agreement or annually at the beginning of each billing coverage period and accounted for as subscriptions with revenue recognized ratably over the billing coverage period.  undelivered elements  undelivered elements consist mainly of payments for unspecified upgrades or enhancements of microsoft internet explorer on a when-and-if-available basis for windows xp, and technology guarantee programs.  other  also included in unearned revenue are payments for post-delivery support and consulting services to be performed in the future; xbox live subscriptions; microsoft dynamics business solutions products; and other offerings for which we have been paid in advance and earn the revenue when we provide the service or software, or otherwise meet the revenue recognition criteria.  the components of unearned revenue were as follows:  \u00a0 \u00a0 70  table of contents   \u00a0  part ii  item 8  \u00a0  \u00a0 unearned revenue by segment was as follows:  \u00a0 note 15 - other long-term liabilities  \u00a0 note 16 - commitments and guarantees  construction and operating leases  we have committed $347 million for constructing new buildings, building improvements and leasehold improvements as of june\u00a030, 2010.  we have operating leases for most u.s. and international sales and support offices and certain equipment. rental expense for facilities operating leases was $530 million, $475 million, and $398 million, in fiscal years 2010, 2009, and 2008, respectively. future minimum rental commitments under noncancellable facilities operating leases in place as of june\u00a030, 2010 are as follows:  \u00a0 indemnifications  we provide indemnifications of varying scope and size to certain customers against claims of intellectual property infringement made by third parties arising from the use of our products and certain other matters. we evaluate estimated losses for these indemnifications, and we consider such factors as the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss. to date, we have not encountered significant costs as a result of these obligations and have not accrued any liabilities related to these indemnifications in our financial statements.  \u00a0 71  table of contents   \u00a0  part ii  item 8  \u00a0  \u00a0 yahoo! commercial agreement  on december\u00a04, 2009, we entered into a definitive agreement with yahoo! whereby microsoft will provide the exclusive algorithmic and paid search platform for yahoo! web sites. the transaction received clearance, without restrictions, from both the u.s. department of justice and the european commission during the third fiscal quarter of 2010. the term of the agreement is 10 years subject to termination provisions after five years based on performance.  microsoft provided yahoo! country level revenue per search guarantees for a period of 18 months after implementation of the bing search platform. these guarantees are calculated, paid, and trued-up in three six-month periods thereafter, and are intended to insure yahoo! against any persistent drop in revenue per search from pre-implementation levels. this is a rate guarantee not a guarantee of search volume. we estimate the total cost of the revenue per search guarantees during the guarantee period could range between zero and $150 million; however, no amount has been recorded for the revenue per search guarantees as we do not believe that such liability exists at this time.  microsoft also agreed to reimburse yahoo! for certain transition expenses incurred both before and after the effective date of the agreement.  finally, microsoft also agreed to reimburse yahoo! for certain costs of running algorithmic and paid search services prior to migration to microsoft\u0092s platform.  product warranty  the changes in our aggregate product warranty liabilities, which are included in other current liabilities and other long term-liabilities on our balance sheets, were as follows:  \u00a0 note 17 - contingencies  government competition law matters  in march\u00a02004, the european commission issued a competition law decision that, among other things, ordered us to license certain windows server protocol technology to our competitors. in march\u00a02007, the european commission issued a statement of objections claiming that the pricing terms we proposed for licensing the technology as required by\u00a0the march 2004 decision were \u0093not reasonable.\u0094 following additional steps we took to address these concerns, the commission announced on october\u00a022, 2007 that we were in compliance with the march 2004 decision and that no further penalty should accrue after that date. on february\u00a027, 2008, the commission issued a fine of $1.4 billion (\u0080899 million) relating to the period prior to october\u00a022, 2007. in may 2008, we filed an application with the european court of first instance to annul the february\u00a02008 fine. we paid the $1.4 billion (\u0080899 million) fine in june 2008, pending the outcome of the appeal.  in january 2008, the commission opened a competition law investigation that relates primarily to interoperability with respect to our microsoft office family of products. this investigation resulted from complaints filed with the commission by a trade association of microsoft\u0092s competitors. microsoft has made a number of proposals to address the commission\u0092s competition law concerns in this area. the commission announced on december\u00a016, 2009 that it welcomed these proposals and that it will take them into account in assessing this matter. during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2010, the trade association withdrew its complaint that was the basis of the investigation.  \u00a0 72  table of contents   \u00a0  part ii  item 8  \u00a0  \u00a0 we are also subject to a consent decree and final judgment (\u0093final judgments\u0094) that resolved lawsuits brought by the u.s. department of justice, 18 states, and the district of columbia in two separate actions. the final judgments imposed various constraints on our windows operating system businesses. the final judgments are scheduled to expire in may 2011.  in other ongoing investigations, various foreign governments and several state attorneys general have requested information from us concerning competition, privacy, and security issues.  antitrust, unfair competition, and overcharge class actions   a large number of antitrust and unfair competition class action lawsuits were filed against us in various state, federal, and canadian courts on behalf of various classes of direct and indirect purchasers of our pc operating system and certain other software products. we obtained dismissals of damages claims of indirect purchasers under federal law and in 15 states. courts refused to certify classes in two additional states. we have reached agreements to settle all claims that have been made to date in 19 states and the district of columbia.  the settlements in all states have received final court approval. under the settlements, generally class members can obtain vouchers that entitle them to be reimbursed for purchases of a wide variety of platform-neutral computer hardware and software. the total value of vouchers that we may issue varies by state. we will make available to certain schools a percentage of those vouchers that are not issued or claimed (one-half to two-thirds depending on the state). the total value of vouchers we ultimately issue will depend on the number of class members who make claims and are issued vouchers. the maximum value of vouchers to be issued is approximately $2.7 billion. the actual costs of these settlements will be less than that maximum amount, depending on the number of class members and schools that are issued and redeem vouchers. we estimate the total cost to resolve all of the state overcharge class action cases will range between $1.9 billion and $2.0 billion. at june\u00a030, 2010, we have recorded a liability related to these claims of approximately $651 million, which reflects our estimated exposure of $1.9 billion less payments made to date of approximately $1.2 billion mostly for vouchers, legal fees, and administrative expenses.  the three cases pending in british columbia, ontario, and quebec, canada have not been settled. in march 2010, the court in the british columbia case certified it as a class action. we have appealed this ruling. the other two actions have been stayed.  other antitrust litigation and claims  in november 2004, novell, inc. filed a complaint in u.s. district court for the district of utah (later transferred to federal court in maryland), asserting antitrust and unfair competition claims against us related to novell\u0092s ownership of wordperfect and other productivity applications during the period between june 1994 and march 1996. in june 2005, the trial court granted our motion to dismiss four of six claims of the complaint. on march\u00a030, 2010, the trial court granted summary judgment in favor of microsoft as to all remaining claims. novell has appealed that ruling.  patent and intellectual property claims   in 2003, we filed an action in u.s. district court in california seeking a declaratory judgment that we do not infringe certain alcatel-lucent patents (although this action began before the merger of alcatel and lucent in 2006, for simplicity we refer to the post-merger entity of alcatel-lucent). in april 2008, a jury returned a verdict in alcatel-lucent\u0092s favor in a trial on a consolidated group of one video and three user interface patents. the jury concluded that we had infringed two user interface patents and awarded $367 million in damages. in june 2008, the trial judge increased the amount of damages to $512 million to include $145 million of interest. we appealed that award to the federal circuit. in december 2008, we entered into a settlement agreement resolving all other litigation pending between microsoft and alcatel-lucent, leaving approximately $500 million remaining in dispute. in september\u00a02009, the united states court of appeals for the federal circuit affirmed the liability award but vacated the verdict and remanded the case to the trial court for a re-trial of the damages ruling, indicating the damages previously awarded were too high. trial on the remanded damages claim has been set for the first week of december 2010.  \u00a0 73  table of contents   \u00a0  part ii  item 8  \u00a0  \u00a0 in october 2003, uniloc usa inc., a subsidiary of a singapore-based security technology company, filed a patent infringement suit in u.s. district court in rhode island, claiming that product activation technology in windows xp and certain other microsoft programs violated a uniloc patent. after we obtained a favorable summary judgment that we did not infringe any of the claims of this patent, the court of appeals vacated the trial court decision and remanded the case for trial. in april 2009, the jury returned a $388 million verdict against us, including a finding of willful infringement. in september\u00a02009, the district court judge overturned the jury verdict, ruling that the evidence did not support the jury\u0092s finding that microsoft infringed the patent. uniloc has appealed.  in march 2007, i4i limited partnership sued microsoft in u.s. district court in texas claiming that certain custom xml technology in word 2003 and 2007 infringed i4i\u0092s patent. in may 2009, a jury returned a verdict against us, finding damages of $200 million and that we willfully infringed the patent. in august 2009, the court denied our post-trial motions and awarded enhanced damages of $40 million and prejudgment interest of $37\u00a0million. the court also issued a permanent injunction prohibiting additional distribution of the allegedly infringing technology. we appealed and the appellate court stayed the injunction pending our appeal. on december\u00a022, 2009, the court of appeals rejected our appeal and affirmed the trial court\u0092s judgment and injunction, except that the court of appeals modified the effective date of the injunction to january\u00a011, 2010. on april\u00a01, 2010, the court of appeals denied our request for a rehearing. we intend to seek review by the u.s. supreme court.  in 2007, virnetx inc. brought suit in u.s. district court in texas claiming that various microsoft products including windows client and server operating systems software and communications software infringe two patents related to technology for securely communicating over the internet.\u00a0this case was tried by a jury in march 2010.\u00a0the jury returned a verdict that microsoft willfully infringed both patents, and found damages of approximately $106\u00a0million.\u00a0in march 2010, virnetx filed a new lawsuit in the eastern district of texas alleging that additional microsoft products and services including windows 7 and windows server 2008 r2 infringe the same two patents. the parties have reached an agreement to settle both lawsuits.  there are over 50 other patent infringement cases pending against microsoft, 10 of which are set for trial in fiscal year 2010.  other  we also are subject to a variety of other claims and suits that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of our business. although management currently believes that resolving claims against us, individually or in aggregate, will not have a material adverse impact on our financial statements, these matters are subject to inherent uncertainties and management\u0092s view of these matters may change in the future.  as of june\u00a030, 2010, we had accrued aggregate liabilities of approximately $1.0 billion in other current liabilities and approximately $236 million in other long-term liabilities for all of the contingent matters described in this note. while we intend to vigorously defend these matters, there exists the possibility of adverse outcomes that we estimate could reach approximately $800 million in aggregate beyond recorded amounts. were unfavorable final outcomes to occur, there exists the possibility of a material adverse impact on our financial statements for the period in which the effects become reasonably estimable.  note 18 - stockholders\u0092 equity  shares outstanding  shares of common stock outstanding were as follows:  \u00a0 \u00a0 74  table of contents   \u00a0  part ii  item 8  \u00a0  \u00a0 share repurchases  on september\u00a022, 2008, we announced the completion of the two repurchase programs approved by our board of directors during the first quarter of fiscal year 2007 to buy back up to $40.0 billion of microsoft common stock. on september\u00a022, 2008, we also announced that our board of directors approved a new share repurchase program authorizing up to $40.0 billion in share repurchases with an expiration date of september\u00a030, 2013. as of june\u00a030, 2010, approximately $23.7 billion remained of the $40.0 billion approved repurchase amount. the repurchase program may be suspended or discontinued at any time without prior notice.  we repurchased the following shares of common stock under the above-described repurchase plans using cash resources:  \u00a0 \u00a0 dividends  in fiscal year 2010, our board of directors declared the following dividends:  \u00a0  the dividend declared on june\u00a016, 2010 will be paid after the filing date of this report on form 10-k and was included in other current liabilities as of june\u00a030, 2010.  in fiscal year 2009, our board of directors declared the following dividends:  \u00a0  the dividend declared on june\u00a010, 2009 was included in other current liabilities as of june\u00a030, 2009.  \u00a0 75  table of contents   \u00a0  part ii  item 8  \u00a0  \u00a0 cumulative effects of changes in accounting principle  on july\u00a01, 2007, we adopted guidance on accounting for uncertainty in income taxes, which provides a financial statement recognition threshold and measurement attribute for a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. upon adoption, we recognized a $395 million charge to our beginning retained deficit as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle.  on july\u00a01, 2007, we adopted accounting guidance which requires companies to accrue the costs of compensated absences under a sabbatical or similar benefit arrangement over the requisite service period. upon adoption, we recognized a $17 million charge to our beginning retained deficit as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle.  note 19 - other comprehensive income  the activity in other comprehensive income and related income tax effects were as follows:  \u00a0 the components of accumulated other comprehensive income were as follows:  \u00a0 note 20 - employee stock and savings plans  stock-based

stock purchase plan for all eligible employees. shares of our common stock may be purchased by employees at three-month intervals at 90% of the fair market value on the last day of each three-month period. employees may purchase shares having a value not exceeding 15% of their gross compensation during an offering period. employees purchased the following shares during the periods presented:  \u00a0  at june\u00a030, 2010, 64\u00a0million shares of our common stock were reserved for future issuance through the employee stock purchase plan.  stock plans  we have stock plans for directors and for officers, employees, consultants, and advisors. at june\u00a030, 2010, an aggregate of 690\u00a0million shares were authorized for future grant under our stock plans, which cover stock options, stock awards, and shared performance stock awards. awards that expire or are canceled without delivery of shares generally become available for issuance under the plans. we issue new shares to satisfy exercises and vestings of awards granted under all of our stock plans.  stock awards  stock awards (\u0093sas\u0094) are grants that entitle the holder to shares of microsoft common stock as the award vests. our sas generally vest over a five-year period.  shared performance stock awards  shared performance stock awards (\u0093spsas\u0094) are a form of sa in which the number of shares ultimately received depends on our business performance against specified performance targets.  we granted spsas for fiscal years 2010, 2009, and 2008 with performance periods of july\u00a01, 2009 through june\u00a030, 2010,\u00a0july\u00a01, 2008 through june\u00a030, 2009, and july\u00a01, 2007 through june\u00a030, 2008, respectively. in september following the end of each performance period, the number of shares of stock subject to the award is determined by multiplying the target award by a percentage ranging from 0% to 150%. the percentage is based on performance metrics for the performance period, as determined by the compensation committee of the board of directors in its sole discretion. an additional number of shares, approximately 12% of the total target spsas, are available as additional awards to participants based on individual performance. one-quarter of the shares of stock subject to each award vest following the end of the performance period, and an additional one-quarter of the shares vest on each of the following three anniversaries of the grant date.  executive officer incentive plan  in fiscal year 2009, the compensation committee approved a new executive officer incentive plan (\u0093eoip\u0094) for executive officers of the company.\u00a0the eoip replaced the annual cash bonus opportunity and equity award plans for executive officers.\u00a0under the eoip, the compensation committee makes awards of performance-based compensation for specified performance periods.\u00a0for fiscal years 2010 and 2009, executive officers were eligible to receive annual awards comprised of cash and sas from an incentive pool equal to a percentage of the company\u0092s operating income. for fiscal year 2010 it was 0.45% of operating income, and for fiscal year 2009 it was 0.35% of operating income. following approval of the awards, 20% of the award is payable to the executive officers in cash, and the remaining 80% is converted into an sa for shares of microsoft common stock. the sa portion of the award vests one-quarter immediately after the award is approved following fiscal year-end,\u00a0and one-quarter on august\u00a031 of each of the following three years.  \u00a0 77  table of contents   \u00a0  part ii  item 8  \u00a0  \u00a0 we grant awards from the incentive pool to the executive officers in september following the end of the fiscal year based on the officer\u0092s performance during the prior fiscal year period. each executive officer receives a fixed percentage of the pool ranging between 0% and 150% of a target based on an assessment of the executive officer\u0092s performance during the fiscal year. the number of shares subject to the sa portion of the award is determined by dividing the value of the award by the closing price of microsoft common stock on august\u00a031 of each year.  activity for all stock plans  the fair value of each award is estimated on the date of grant using the following assumptions:  \u00a0  during fiscal year 2010, the following activity occurred under our existing plans:  \u00a0 as of june\u00a030, 2010, there was $4.2 billion and $482 million of total unrecognized compensation costs related to sas and spsas, respectively. these costs are expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 3.4 years and 2.4 years, respectively.  during fiscal year 2009 and 2008, the following activity occurred under our stock plans:  \u00a0  \u00a0 78  table of contents   \u00a0  part ii  item 8  \u00a0  \u00a0 stock options  in fiscal year 2004, we began granting employees and non-employee directors sas rather than non-qualified and incentive stock options as part of our equity compensation plans. since then, stock options issued to employees have been issued primarily in conjunction with business acquisitions. options granted between 1995 and 2001 generally vest over four and one-half years and expire seven years from the date of grant, while certain options vest either over four and one-half years or over seven and one-half years and expire 10 years from the date of grant. options granted after 2001 vest over four and one-half years and expire 10 years from the date of grant. we granted one million, one\u00a0million, and 10\u00a0million stock options in conjunction with business acquisitions during fiscal years 2010, 2009, and 2008, respectively.  employee stock options activity was as follows:  \u00a0  options outstanding as of june\u00a030, 2010 include approximately three\u00a0million options that were granted in conjunction with business acquisitions. while these options are included in the options outstanding balance, they are excluded from the weighted average exercise price. these options have an exercise price range of $0.01 to $150.93 and a weighted average exercise price of $7.49.  during fiscal years 2010, 2009, and 2008, the following activity occurred under our stock plans:  \u00a0  cash received from option exercises for fiscal years 2010, 2009, and 2008, was $1.8 billion, $88 million, and $3.0 billion, respectively. the actual tax benefit realized for the tax deductions from option exercises totaled $126 million, $12 million, and $365 million for fiscal years 2010, 2009, and 2008, respectively.  savings plan  we have a savings plan in the united states that qualifies under section\u00a0401(k) of the internal revenue code, and a number of savings plans in international locations. participating u.s. employees may contribute up to 50% of their salary, but not more than statutory limits. we contribute fifty cents for each dollar a participant contributes in this plan, with a maximum contribution of 3% of a participant\u0092s earnings. matching contributions for all plans were $275 million, $262 million, and $238 million in fiscal years 2010, 2009, and 2008, respectively, and were expensed as contributed. matching contributions are invested proportionate to each participant\u0092s voluntary contributions in the investment options provided under the plan. investment options in the u.s. plan include microsoft common stock, but neither participant nor our matching contributions are required to be invested in microsoft common stock.  \u00a0 79  table of contents   \u00a0  part ii  item 8  \u00a0  \u00a0 note 21 - employee severance  in january 2009, we announced and implemented a resource management program to reduce discretionary operating expenses, employee headcount, and capital expenditures. as part of this program, we announced the elimination of 5,000 positions in research and development, marketing, sales, finance, legal, human resources, and information technology. as of september\u00a030, 2009, we had reduced our overall number of positions by approximately 5,000 and headcount by approximately 4,600.  in november 2009, we identified an additional 800 positions for elimination based on our efforts to manage our expenses. severance expense of approximately $52 million associated with these additional eliminations was reflected in our financial statements. we have now completed this program and reduced our overall headcount by approximately 5,300.  the changes in our employee severance liabilities related to our resource management efforts were as follows:  \u00a0 note 22 - segment information and geographic data  in its operation of the business, management, including our chief operating decision maker, the company\u0092s chief executive officer, reviews certain financial information, including segmented internal profit and loss statements prepared on a basis not consistent with accounting principles generally accepted in the u.s. (\u0093u.s. gaap\u0094). our five segments are windows\u00a0& windows live division; server and tools; online services division; microsoft business division; and entertainment and devices division. we have recast certain prior period amounts within this note to conform to the way we internally managed and monitored segment performance during the current fiscal year, including moving windows live from online services division to windows\u00a0& windows live division and razorfish from online services division to corporate. razorfish was sold during the second quarter of fiscal year 2010.  segment revenue and operating income (loss) were as follows:  \u00a0 \u00a0 80  table of contents   \u00a0  part ii  item 8  \u00a0  \u00a0 the types of products and services provided by each segment are summarized below:  windows\u00a0& windows live division \u0096 windows\u00a0& windows live division offerings consist of windows operating systems, including windows 7, and online software and services through windows live. windows live primarily generates revenue from online advertising.  server and tools \u0096 server and tools product and service offerings consist of windows server, microsoft sql server, windows azure and other cloud and server offerings. server and tools also offers enterprise services, which comprise premier product support services and microsoft consulting services.  online services division \u0096 online services division consists of an online advertising platform with offerings for both publishers and advertisers, online information offerings, such as bing, and the msn portals and channels around the world.  microsoft business division \u0096 microsoft business division offerings include microsoft office, sharepoint, and microsoft dynamics business solutions. entertainment and devices division \u0096 entertainment and devices division offerings include the xbox 360 platform, the zune digital music and entertainment platform, pc software games, online games and services, mediaroom (our internet protocol television software), windows phone, windows embedded device platforms, application software for apple\u0092s macintosh computers, and microsoft pc hardware products.  due to the integrated structure of our business, certain costs incurred by one segment may benefit other segments. the costs that are identifiable are allocated to the segments that benefit to incent cross-collaboration among our segments so that one segment is not solely burdened by the cost of a mutually beneficial activity. each allocation is measured differently based on the specific facts and circumstances of the costs being allocated. these cost allocations were not material in any period presented.  \u00a0 81  table of contents   \u00a0  part ii  item 8  \u00a0  \u00a0 in addition, certain costs incurred at a corporate level that are identifiable and that benefit our segments are allocated to them. these allocated costs include costs of: field selling; employee benefits; shared facilities services; and customer service and support. each allocation is measured differently based on the specific facts and circumstances of the costs being allocated. certain other corporate-level activity is not allocated to our segments, including costs of: broad-based sales and marketing; product support services; human resources; legal; finance; information technology; corporate development and procurement activities; research and development; legal settlements and contingencies; and employee severance.  assets are not allocated to segments for internal reporting presentations. a portion of amortization and depreciation is included with various other costs in an overhead allocation to each segment and it is impracticable for us to separately identify the amount of amortization and depreciation by segment that is included in the measure of segment profit or loss.  reconciling amounts in the tables above and below include adjustments to conform our internal accounting policies to u.s. gaap and corporate-level activity not specifically attributed to a segment. significant internal accounting policies that differ from u.s. gaap relate to revenue recognition, income statement classification, depreciation, and amortization of stock-based awards.  significant reconciling items were as follows:  \u00a0 \u00a0 no sales to an individual customer accounted for more than 10% of fiscal year 2010, 2009, or 2008 revenue. revenue, classified by the major geographic areas in which our customers are located, was as follows:  \u00a0 \u00a0 revenues from external customers, classified by significant product and service offerings were as follows:  \u00a0 \u00a0 82  table of contents   \u00a0  part ii  item 8  \u00a0  \u00a0

(unaudited)  \u00a0  \u00a0 \u00a0 83  table of contents   \u00a0  part ii  item 8  \u00a0  \u00a0 report of independent registered public accounting firm  to the board of directors and stockholders of microsoft corporation:  we have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of microsoft corporation and subsidiaries (the \u0093company\u0094) as of june\u00a030, 2010 and 2009, and the related consolidated statements of income, cash flows, and stockholders\u0092 equity for each of the three years in the period ended june\u00a030, 2010.\u00a0these financial statements are the responsibility of the company\u0092s management. our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.  we conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board (united states).\u00a0those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.\u00a0an audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.\u00a0an audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. we believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.  in our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of microsoft corporation and subsidiaries as of june\u00a030, 2010 and 2009, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended june\u00a030, 2010, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america.  we have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board (united states), the company\u0092s internal control over financial reporting as of june\u00a030, 2010, based on the criteria established in internal control \u0096 integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring

ii\u00a0  item 7  \u00a0 worldwide macroeconomic factors have a strong correlation to business and consumer demand for our software, services, games and internet service offerings. we expect a broad continuation in the economic conditions and demand in fiscal year 2007 as compared to fiscal year 2006.  as open source software development and distribution evolves, we continue to seek to differentiate our products from competing products that are based on open source software. we believe that microsoft\u0092s share of server unit operating systems increased in fiscal year 2006.  summary of results for fiscal years 2006, 2005, and 2004  \u00a0 our revenue growth for fiscal year 2006 was driven primarily by growth in sql server following the launch of sql server 2005 in the second quarter, windows server and other server applications, increased xbox revenue resulting from the xbox 360 launch in the second quarter, growth in licensing of windows client operating systems through oems, and increased licensing of office and other information worker products. based on our estimates, total worldwide pc shipments from all sources grew approximately 12% to 14% and total server hardware shipments grew approximately 11% to 13% during fiscal year 2006. foreign currency exchange rates did not have a significant impact on consolidated or operating segment revenue during the fiscal year.  revenue growth for fiscal year 2005 was driven by growth in licensing of windows server operating systems and other server applications, licensing of windows client operating systems through oems, and increased licensing of office and other information worker products. the november 2004 launch of the \u0093halo 2\u0094 xbox game also contributed to overall revenue growth for the company. total worldwide pc shipments from all sources grew approximately 11% to 13% and total server hardware shipments grew approximately 13% to 14% during fiscal year 2005 as compared to fiscal year 2004. the net impact of foreign exchange rates on revenue was positive in 2005, primarily due to relative strengthening of most foreign currencies, particularly the euro and japanese yen, against the u.s. dollar. partially offsetting revenue growth rates was a $1.08 billion decline in earned revenue from upgrade advantage in fiscal year 2005. this revenue was recognized over fiscal year 2003 and fiscal year 2004 and in the first quarter of fiscal year 2005 when the contract period expired. fiscal year 2004 revenue growth was primarily driven by the growth in licensing of windows client operating systems through oems, windows server operating systems, office and other server applications as a result of growth in pc and server hardware shipments. the worldwide pc shipment growth rate from all sources was estimated at 13% and the windows server shipment was estimated at 18% in fiscal year 2004 as compared to fiscal year 2003. the net impact of foreign exchange rates on revenue was positive in fiscal year 2004 due to a relative strengthening of most foreign currencies versus the u.s. dollar. this resulted in approximately $1.10 billion growth in total revenue.  operating income for fiscal year 2006 increased primarily reflecting the revenue increase and a $991 million decrease in costs for legal settlements and legal contingencies. these changes were partially offset by a $1.62 billion increase in cost of revenue primarily related to xbox 360 and a $1.26 billion increase in sales and marketing expense primarily as a result of increased investments in partner marketing and product launch-related spending. headcount-related costs, including stock-based compensation expense, increased $682 million or 7% resulting from both an increase in salaries and benefits for existing headcount and a 16% growth in headcount over the past twelve months. stock-based compensation expense decreased $733 million or 30% reflecting a continuing decline in stock option amortization expense.  operating income increased in fiscal year 2005 due to a decline in stock-based compensation expense; increased revenue in server and tools, client and information worker, which have higher gross margins as compared to other segments; and a reduction in legal costs associated with major litigation. in addition, strong sales of halo 2 reduced the overall operating loss for the home and entertainment segment for fiscal year 2005. the $3.29 billion decrease in stock-based compensation expense was partially offset by increased operating expenses of $562 million related to increased salary and benefits for new and existing headcount. general and administrative expenses related to major litigation declined in fiscal year 2005 due to the $2.53 billion of charges related to the settlement of sun   \u00a0  table of contents \u00a0part ii\u00a0  item 7  \u00a0  microsystems litigation and the fine imposed by the european commission in fiscal year 2004. this effect was partially offset by legal expenses of $2.08 billion related to settlements with ibm, novell, gateway, and end-user class action plaintiffs to resolve antitrust issues and other matters. in fiscal year 2004, the operating income decline was caused primarily by $2.53 billion of legal charges and $2.21 billion of stock-based compensation expense related to our employee stock option transfer program, mainly offset by an increase in revenue.  we implemented changes in employee compensation in fiscal year 2004 whereby employees are granted stock awards rather than stock options. we also completed an employee stock option transfer program in the second quarter of fiscal year 2004 in which employees could elect to transfer all of their vested and unvested stock options with a strike price of $33.00 or higher to jpmorgan chase bank (\u0093jpmorgan\u0094). the unvested options that were transferred to jpmorgan became vested upon the transfer. a total of 345\u00a0million of the 621\u00a0million eligible options were transferred, which resulted in additional stock-based compensation expense of $2.21 billion in the second quarter of fiscal year 2004. as a result of these changes, stock-based compensation expense decreased in fiscal years 2006 and 2005, and we expect stock-based compensation expense related to stock options to continue to decrease in fiscal year 2007.  fiscal year 2007 outlook  in fiscal year 2007, we expect continued double digit revenue growth primarily as a result of the upcoming launches of windows vista and the 2007 microsoft office system. we estimate worldwide pc shipments will grow between 8% and 10%. we expect that pc unit growth rates will be higher in the consumer segment than in the business segment and higher in emerging markets than in mature markets. we estimate worldwide server unit shipments will grow between 10% and 12% in fiscal year 2007 as compared to fiscal year 2006. we do not expect a significant impact from year-over-year foreign currency exchange rates in fiscal year 2007.  we expect our operating income growth rate to lag our revenue growth rate in the first half of fiscal year 2007 due to an increasing mix of xbox 360 console revenue and related costs, coupled with significant investments in preparation for the launches of our flagship products. we expect this trend to reverse in the second half of the fiscal year when we expect operating income to grow faster than revenue.  segment product revenue/operating income (loss)  our seven segments were client; server and tools; information worker; microsoft business solutions; msn; mobile and embedded devices; and home and entertainment. on july\u00a017, 2006, we announced a change in our operating segments reflecting the culmination of our realignment announced in september 2005. these changes will be effective for fiscal year 2007; the seven segments discussed in this analysis are presented the way we internally managed and monitored performance at the business group level in fiscal years 2006, 2005, and 2004.  the revenue and operating income/(loss) amounts in this section are presented on a basis consistent with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles (\u0093gaap\u0094) and include certain reconciling items attributable to each of the segments. the segment information appearing in note 18 \u0096 segment information of the notes to financial statements is presented on a basis consistent with the company\u0092s internal management reporting, in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards (\u0093sfas\u0094) no.\u00a0131, disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information. certain corporate level expenses have been excluded from our segment operating results and are analyzed separately. fiscal years 2005 and 2004 amounts have been restated for certain internal reorganizations and to conform to the fiscal year 2006 presentation.  client  \u00a0 \u00a0    table of contents \u00a0part ii\u00a0  item 7  \u00a0 client consists of premium edition operating systems, including windows xp professional, media center edition, tablet pc edition, and other standard windows operating systems, including windows xp home. premium offerings are windows operating systems sold at a premium above windows xp home. client revenue growth correlates with the growth of purchases of pcs from oems that pre-install versions of windows operating systems because the oem channel accounts for over 80% of total client revenue.  client revenue increased in fiscal year 2006 reflecting $1.18 billion or 12% growth in oem revenue driven by 17% growth in oem license units from increased pc unit shipments, partially offset by a $118 million or 6% decrease in revenue from commercial and retail licensing of windows operating systems. during the year, the mix of oem windows operating systems licensed with premium edition operating systems as a percentage of total oem windows operating systems licensed (\u0093oem premium mix\u0094) increased two percentage points to 52%. oem revenue growth included an increase to revenue of $89 million resulting from the alignment of our billings associated with oem distributors in our system builder channel with both industry standards and other microsoft channels. the differences between unit growth rates and revenue growth rates from year to year are affected by changes in the oem premium mix, changes in the geographical mix, and the channel mix of products sold by large, multi-national oems versus those sold by local and regional system builders. client revenue increased in fiscal year 2005 driven by 12% growth in oem license units and $886 million or 10% growth in oem revenue from increased pc unit shipments, partially offset by a $198 million or 9% decrease in revenue from commercial and retail licensing of windows operating systems. the oem premium mix remained flat at 50% of total oem windows operating systems as compared to the previous year. revenue earned from upgrade advantage declined by $99 million in fiscal year 2005 contributing to the decrease in commercial and retail licensing revenue.  client operating income increased in fiscal year 2006 reflecting the increase in oem revenue partially offset by a $224 million increase in sales and marketing expenses, excluding headcount-related costs, mainly driven by increased investments in partner marketing and windows vista pre-launch programs. headcount-related costs increased 6% in fiscal year 2006 reflecting both a 13% increase in headcount primarily associated with windows vista and further investments in our sales and marketing organization, and an increase in salaries and benefits for existing headcount, partially offset by a decrease in stock-based compensation expense. client operating income increased in fiscal year 2005 primarily due to an increase in oem revenue and a $444 million decrease in stock-based compensation expense. these factors were partially offset by an increase in sales and marketing expenses associated with \u0093start something,\u0094 a globally launched advertising campaign, marketing for security initiatives, and an increase in salary and benefits for new and existing headcount. the additional headcount for research and development was primarily devoted to the continued development of windows vista.  server and tools  \u00a0 server and tools consists of server software licenses and client access licenses (\u0093cal\u0094) for windows server, microsoft sql server, exchange server and other server products. it also includes developer tools, training, certification, microsoft press, premier and professional product support services, and microsoft consulting services. server and tools concentrates on licensing products, applications, tools, content and services that make information technology professionals and developers more productive and efficient. the segment uses multiple channels for licensing including pre-installed oem versions, licenses through partners, and licenses directly to end customers. the licenses are sold both as one-time licenses and as multi-year volume licenses. server and tools uses product innovation and partnerships with information technology professionals to drive the adoption and sales growth of its products.  server and tools revenue increased during fiscal year 2006 mainly driven by growth in sql server, windows server, and core cal. sql server 2005 and visual studio 2005 were launched in the second quarter of fiscal year 2006 and produced revenue growth in these product lines. revenue is impacted by overall server hardware shipments which we estimate grew 11% to 13% in fiscal year 2006. server and server applications revenue, including cal revenue, and developer tools, training and certification revenue grew $1.31 billion or 16% during fiscal year 2006. the results reflect broad adoption of windows server products, especially sql server, which grew over 30% for   \u00a0  table of contents \u00a0part ii\u00a0  item 7  \u00a0  the year. consulting, premier and professional product support services revenue increased $218 million or 15% primarily due to higher demand for services. in fiscal year 2005, server and server application revenue, including cal revenue, grew $1.10 billion or 17%. consulting, premier, and professional product support services revenue increased $241 million or 19% compared to the previous year. foreign currency exchange rate changes accounted for $284 million or three percentage points of total server and tools revenue growth, which was offset by a $314 million decline in upgrade advantage revenue earned.  server and tools operating income increased during fiscal year 2006 primarily reflecting increased revenue, partially offset by increased sales and marketing expenses. excluding headcount-related costs, sales and marketing expenses increased $274 million due to additional spending to support long-term strategies and marketing expenses primarily related to the launch of sql server 2005 and visual studio 2005. total server and tools headcount-related costs increased 5% related to both an 11% increase in headcount and an increase in salaries and benefits for existing headcount, partially offset by a decrease in stock-based compensation expense. in fiscal year 2005, server and tools operating income increased primarily due to increased revenue and a $1.07 billion decrease in stock-based compensation expense. this increase was partially offset by an increase in sales and marketing costs and headcount-related costs as a result of increased headcount and an increase in salaries and benefits for existing headcount.  information worker  \u00a0 information worker primarily consists of the microsoft office system of programs, servers, solutions, and services designed to increase personal, team, and organization productivity. information worker includes microsoft office, microsoft project, microsoft visio, sharepoint portal server cal, and other information worker products including office communications server and onenote. revenue growth depends on the ability to add value to the core office product set and expand our product offerings in other information worker areas such as enterprise content management, collaboration, unified communications, and business intelligence.  information worker revenue increased in fiscal year 2006 primarily reflecting a $521 million or 5% increase in volume licensing, retail packaged products, and preinstalled versions of office in japan, while oem revenue increased $66 million or 4%. information worker revenue increased in fiscal year 2005 primarily reflecting a $269\u00a0million or 3% increase in volume licensing, retail packaged product, and pre-installed versions of office in japan, a $91 million or 6% increase in oem revenue, and the impact of foreign currency exchange rates, partially offset by reduced upgrade advantage earned revenue. changes in foreign currency exchange rates accounted for approximately $367 million or three percentage points of the revenue growth for fiscal year 2005, offset by a $663 million decline in upgrade advantage earned revenue.  information worker operating income increased in fiscal year 2006 primarily due to the revenue growth, partially offset by a $283 million or 15% increase in sales and marketing expenses related to supporting field sales efforts and a $71 million or 10% increase in research and development expenses. headcount-related costs increased 14% during fiscal year 2006 reflecting both an 18% increase in headcount related to supporting field sales efforts and research and development investments in future products and an increase in salaries and benefits for existing headcount, partially offset by a decrease in stock-based compensation expense. information worker operating income growth for fiscal year 2005 was primarily due to the revenue growth and a $304 million decrease in stock-based compensation expense. operating expenses were also impacted by a reduction in marketing campaign costs from the previous period associated with the launch of office 2003. this decline was offset by an increase in headcount-related costs as a result of an increase in headcount and an increase in salaries and benefits for existing headcount.  \u00a0    table of contents \u00a0part ii\u00a0  item 7  \u00a0 microsoft business solutions  \u00a0 microsoft business solutions provides business management software solutions targeted to businesses of varying sizes. the main products consist of enterprise resource planning (\u0093erp\u0094) solutions, customer relationship management (\u0093crm\u0094) software, retail solutions, microsoft partner program (\u0093mspp\u0094), and related services. microsoft business solutions also includes the small and mid-market solutions and partners (\u0093sms&p\u0094), which focuses on sales to customers and partners in the small and mid-market customer segments. revenue is derived from software and services sales, with software sales representing a significant amount of total revenue. software revenues include both new software licenses and enhancement plans, which provide customers with future software upgrades over the period of the plan. our solutions are delivered through a worldwide network of channel partners that provide services and local support.  microsoft business solutions revenue increased in fiscal year 2006 driven by new users for microsoft crm and existing dynamics erp customers purchasing functionality and user licenses. the increase in microsoft business solutions revenue in fiscal year 2005 was mainly due to 10% revenue growth in software partially offset by 25% decline in services revenue. the software revenue increase was driven by 9% growth in license revenue and 16% growth in enhancement revenue and was attributed to growth in erp and crm solutions and an increase in mspp subscriptions.  microsoft business solutions operating income increased in fiscal year 2006 reflecting the increase in revenue accompanied by a $56 million decrease in sales and marketing expense as a result of decreased net sms&p spending.\u00a0headcount-related costs increased 3% reflecting both a 10% increase in headcount and an increase in salaries and benefits for existing headcount, partially offset by a decrease in stock-based compensation expense. microsoft business solutions operating loss declined in fiscal year 2005 primarily due to a $175 million decline in stock-based compensation expense, an increase in product revenue, and a decline in amortization of acquired intangibles. the reduction in operating loss was partially offset by a net increase in sales and marketing expense driven by incremental costs in the sms&p organization. in addition, we increased our marketing and product development spending in our erp and crm portfolios.  msn  \u00a0 msn includes personal communications services, such as e-mail and instant messaging, and online information offerings, such as msn search, and the msn portals and channels around the world. msn also provides a variety of online paid services in addition to msn internet access and msn premium web services. revenue is derived primarily from advertisers on msn, from consumers and partners through subscriptions and transactions generated from online paid services, and from msn narrowband internet access subscribers. in fiscal year 2006, we launched msn adcenter \u0096 our internally developed advertising platform \u0096 in certain international markets and throughout the u.s. where it now serves 100 percent of paid search traffic on our online properties. we believe msn adcenter will enable us to increase both display and search advertising revenues by reducing our reliance on third parties for delivering ads. effective july\u00a01, 2005, functions related to mappoint previously reported in mobile and embedded   \u00a0  table of contents \u00a0part ii\u00a0  item 7  \u00a0  devices were moved to msn. mobile and embedded devices and msn operating results for the prior periods have been restated for this reorganization. we announced in fiscal year 2006, windows live\u0099, a set of internet services and software designed to improve the users\u0092 connected experience, including windows live\u0099 local and windows live messenger.  msn revenue decreased in fiscal year 2006 primarily reflecting a $195 million or 28% decline in access revenue, partially offset by a $126 million or 9% increase in advertising revenue and a $23 million or 9% increase in revenue from subscription and transaction services other than access. as of june\u00a030, 2006, msn had 2.1\u00a0million access subscribers compared with 2.7\u00a0million at june\u00a030, 2005. in addition, msn had over 261\u00a0million active hotmail accounts and over 243\u00a0million active messenger accounts as of june\u00a030, 2006. the increase in advertising revenue reflects growth in display advertising for portals, channels, email, and messaging services, which was partially offset by a decline in search revenue due to the transition to adcenter. in fiscal year 2005, msn revenue increased reflecting $193 million or 16% growth in advertising revenue primarily as a result of industry and market growth and continued growth of msn display advertising revenue and $84 million or 88% growth in subscription and transaction services revenue. these increases were partially offset by the search clarity in advertising program, the impact of the homepage redesign, and a decline of $219 million or 24% in access revenue, driven by the continued migration of internet access subscribers to broadband or other competitively priced internet service providers.  msn operating income decreased in fiscal year 2006 due to a $230 million or 39% increase in research and development costs, a $126 million or 22% increase in sales and marketing expenses, and a $67 million or 9% increase in cost of revenue as we continue to invest in msn adcenter, windows live, and other new platforms. headcount-related costs increased 25% reflecting a 44% increase in headcount and increased salaries and benefits for existing employees, partially offset by a decrease in stock-based compensation.\u00a0in fiscal year 2005, msn operating income increased mainly due to a $241 million decrease in stock-based compensation expense, reduced costs associated with the internet access business, and increased advertising and subscription revenue. partially offsetting the decreased expenses were increased headcount-related costs as a result of increased headcount and an increase in salaries and benefits for existing headcount.  mobile and embedded devices  \u00a0 * not meaningful  mobile and embedded devices includes windows mobile software, windows embedded operating systems, and windows automotive. these products extend the advantages of the windows platform to mobile devices such as pdas, phones, and a wide range of embedded devices. the business is also responsible for managing sales and customer relationships for microsoft overall with device manufacturers and communication sector customers. the communication sector includes network service providers (such as wireless, wireline and cable operators) and media and entertainment companies. the market for products in these segments is intensely competitive. competitive alternatives vary based on product lines and include product offerings from commercial and non-commercial mobile operating system providers, and proprietary software developed by oems and mobile operators. effective july\u00a01, 2005, functions related to mappoint previously reported in mobile and embedded devices were moved to msn. mobile and embedded devices and msn operating results for the prior periods have been restated for this reorganization.  mobile and embedded devices revenue increased in fiscal year 2006 primarily due to unit volume increases in major product lines, especially windows mobile software sales and windows embedded operating systems. increased revenue for windows mobile software was primarily driven by increased market demand for phone-enabled devices, partially offset by a decline in shipments for stand-alone pdas. in fiscal year 2006, revenue for windows mobile software increased $55 million or 37% while revenue for windows embedded operating systems increased $49\u00a0million or 47%, which was primarily due to the product being included in new product designs for both new and existing customers. unit volume increases in major product lines drove revenue growth for fiscal year 2005 over fiscal   \u00a0    table of contents \u00a0part ii\u00a0  item 7  \u00a0  year 2004, primarily driven by increased market demand for phone-enabled devices, and increased growth in shipments for standalone pdas. in fiscal year 2005, revenue for windows mobile software increased $46 million or 45% and revenue for windows embedded operating systems increased $19 million or 21%. unit volume increases in major product lines drove revenue growth for fiscal year 2005 over fiscal year 2004, primarily driven by increased market demand for phone-enabled devices, and increased growth in shipments for standalone pdas.  mobile and embedded devices generated operating income for fiscal year 2006 as opposed to the operating loss in fiscal year 2005 primarily due to increased revenue, partially offset by a $42 million or 21% increase in both research and development and general and administrative expenses. headcount-related costs increased 15% reflecting both a 24% increase in headcount and an increase in salaries and benefits for existing headcount, partially offset by a decrease in stock-based compensation expense. the operating loss for fiscal year 2005 decreased compared to fiscal year 2004 primarily due to a $95 million decrease in stock-based compensation, as well as the growth in revenue and a decrease in sales and marketing expense. this improvement was partially offset by increased salary and benefit costs from increased headcount, and increased investment in research and development.  home and entertainment  \u00a0 home and entertainment includes the microsoft xbox video game console system, pc games, cpxg (consumer software and hardware products), and tv platform products for the interactive television industry. the success of video game consoles is determined by console innovation, the portfolio of video game content for the console, online offerings, and the market share of the console. our xbox business is transitioning to a new console, the xbox 360, which launched in the second quarter of fiscal year 2006.\u00a0we believe that the functionality of our new console, games portfolio, and online offerings are well-positioned relative to forthcoming competitive consoles.\u00a0we also believe launching in advance of competitive consoles will provide a strategic advantage for the long-term success of xbox 360.\u00a0revenue from the first generation of xbox products has declined and is expected to continue to decline as a result of the introduction of xbox 360.  home and entertainment revenue increased in fiscal year 2006 primarily due to the launch of the xbox 360 console partially offset by a decline in first party xbox game sales primarily resulting from the significant impact of halo 2 in fiscal year 2005. we sold approximately 5\u00a0million xbox 360 consoles during fiscal year 2006. the revenue growth was also attributable to $140 million or 15% growth from our other product lines, primarily as a result of an increase in pc games sales due to significant new game releases, especially \u0093age of empires iii\u0094, and an increase in mstv revenue due to deployments in fiscal year 2006. revenue increased in fiscal year 2005 primarily due to significant new product launches, which resulted in a $416 million or 23% increase in xbox revenue. halo 2 was introduced in the second quarter of fiscal year 2005 and generated over $300 million in revenue in fiscal year 2005. revenue from consumer hardware and software, pc games, and tv platforms declined $50 million or 5% compared to fiscal year 2004 due to lower pc games software sales.  home and entertainment operating loss increased in fiscal year 2006 primarily as a result of a $1.64 billion increase in cost of revenue resulting from the number of xbox 360 consoles sold and higher xbox 360 unit costs, partially offset by the revenue growth. our fiscal year 2006 operating loss increased due to the significant impact of halo 2 in fiscal year 2005. headcount-related costs increased 5% reflecting both a 19% increase in headcount and an increase in salaries and benefits for existing headcount, partially offset by a decrease in stock-based compensation expense. the fiscal year 2005 operating loss decreased primarily due to an increase in high margin xbox software sales, lower xbox console units costs, a $90 million lower-of-cost-or-market inventory adjustment recorded in fiscal year 2004, and a $219 million decrease in stock-based compensation expense. the decrease was partially offset by an increase in costs associated with xbox 360 console development and related launch efforts.  \u00a0  table of contents \u00a0part ii\u00a0  item 7  \u00a0 corporate-level activity  \u00a0 certain corporate-level expenses are not allocated to our segments. those expenses primarily include corporate operations related to broad-based sales and marketing, product support services, human resources, legal, finance, information technology, corporate development and procurement activities, research and development and other costs, and legal settlements and contingencies.  corporate-level expenses decreased in fiscal year 2006, primarily reflecting a $991 million decrease in costs for legal settlements and legal contingencies partially offset by an $84 million increase in headcount-related costs. we incurred $1.32 billion in legal charges during fiscal year 2006 including settlement expense of $361 million related to our settlement with realnetworks, inc. as well as other intellectual property and antitrust matters, and the \u0080281 million ($351 million) fine imposed by the european commission in july 2006 related to its 2004 decision in its competition law investigation of microsoft, as compared to $2.31 billion in legal charges incurred during the prior year primarily related to settlements with novell, inc., gateway, ibm, and other antitrust and competition law matters. headcount-related costs increased 5% during the twelve months ended june\u00a030, 2006 reflecting both a 23% increase in headcount and an increase in salaries and benefits for existing headcount, partially offset by a decrease in stock-based compensation.  corporate-level expenses decreased in fiscal year 2005, primarily as a result of a $736 million reduction in stock-based compensation expense and decreased costs for legal settlements and legal contingencies. in fiscal year 2005, we recognized $2.31 billion in legal charges as compared to $2.53 billion in fiscal year 2004 which included a $1.92 billion charge for a settlement with the sun microsystems, inc., and the fine of \u0080497 million ($605 million) imposed by the european commission.  change to financial reporting structure  on july\u00a017, 2006, we announced that effective the first quarter of fiscal year 2007, we will report our businesses under five operating segments, reflecting completion of the previously announced changes in our organizational structure and how we will manage our business beginning in fiscal year 2007. each of the five segments will be organized under one of the three operating divisions announced earlier in fiscal year 2006:  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 the five operating segments are described below. the first three of these will comprise the platforms and services division.  client\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0will include the former client segment. products will include windows xp professional and home, media center edition, tablet pc edition, and other standard windows operating systems.  server and tools\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0will include the former server and tools segment, excluding the exchange server business and certain client access licenses related to products residing in the microsoft business division. products will include the windows server operating system, microsoft sql server, microsoft consulting services, product support services, visual studio, system center products, the forefront security family of products, and biz talk server, among others.  online services business\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0will include the former msn segment and windows live. products will include msn search, mappoint, msn internet access, msn premium web services, msn mobile services, and windows live.  microsoft business division\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0will include the former information worker and microsoft business solutions segments, as well as the exchange server business and certain client access licenses, formerly included in the server and tools segment. products will include microsoft office, microsoft project, microsoft visio, sharepoint portal server cal, microsoft live meeting, one note, office communication server, microsoft dynamics ax, microsoft   \u00a0    table of contents \u00a0part ii\u00a0  item 7  \u00a0  dynamics crm, microsoft dynamics gp, microsoft dynamics nav, microsoft dynamics sl, microsoft dynamics retail management system, microsoft partner program, and microsoft office small business accounting.  entertainment and devices division\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0will include the former home and entertainment and mobile and embedded devices segments. products will include xbox 360, xbox, xbox live, cpxg (consumer software and hardware products), iptv, windows mobile software platform, windows embedded device operating system, and windows automotive.  our historical results under this new segmentation for the four quarters in fiscal years 2006 and 2005 were as follows:  revenue  \u00a0 operating income / (loss)  \u00a0 our outlook for fiscal year 2007 based on the five operating segments is as follows:  client\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0we expect revenue to grow reflecting improvement in the commercial and retail portion of the business due to our upcoming launch of windows vista. we expect revenue generated from oems to grow slower than the pc hardware market due to increased concentration among larger oems, consumer hardware shipments growing faster than business shipments, and relatively faster growth in emerging markets. we expect pc shipments to grow 8% to 10% for fiscal year 2007. we believe that pc unit growth rates will be higher in the consumer segment than in the business segment and higher in emerging markets than in mature markets.  server and tools\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0we expect continued momentum from recent product launches and the expansion of our products in security, management and designer tools will help drive our overall revenue growth in fiscal year 2007. we estimate overall server hardware unit shipments will grow 10% to 12% in fiscal year 2007. however, we face competition from linux-based, unix, and other server operating systems as well as competition in server applications.  \u00a0  table of contents \u00a0part ii\u00a0  item 7  \u00a0 online services business\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0we expect increased growth in display advertising revenue as the portals, channels, and communications services continue to expand globally and the overall internet advertising industry continues to expand. our search revenue is expected to grow in fiscal year 2007 as a result of continued ramp up of adcenter. we expect revenue from narrowband internet access to continue to decline in fiscal year 2007.  microsoft business division\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0we expect microsoft business division revenue to grow in fiscal year 2007. we feel that our customers\u0092 continued preference to purchase annuity contracts indicates enthusiasm for the 2007 microsoft office system.\u00a0we also expect continued demand for our dynamics products, building on the fiscal 2006 momentum.  entertainment and devices division\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0we expect revenue to increase from fiscal year 2006 due to the increased availability of the xbox 360 console unit during the entire fiscal year, including the second holiday season after the launch in fiscal year 2006. in fiscal year 2007, we expect to introduce a music and entertainment device, the first in a new family of hardware and software products for the consumer market. the availability of a commercial iptv product is expected to drive significant growth in mstv revenue across several geographies. revenue from existing mobility and embedded devices is expected to increase due to unit volume increases of windows mobile software driven by increased market demand for phone-enabled devices and windows embedded operating systems. short product life cycles in product lines such as windows mobile software may impact our continuing revenue streams. xbox 360 console unit costs are expected to decline.  as we implement our long-term growth strategy, we expect to increase our level of spending in four key areas in fiscal year 2007: increased product costs associated with xbox consoles; marketing and field sales spending including launch costs; quickening the pace of development in growth areas such as business intelligence, security, management and unified communications (including acquisitions); and increased costs to execute on our online services strategy. while these investments will translate into increased operating expenses in fiscal year 2007, we believe they will help lay the groundwork for future growth and profitability.  operating expenses  cost of revenue  \u00a0 cost of revenue includes manufacturing and distribution costs for products sold and programs licensed, operating costs related to product support service centers and product distribution centers, costs incurred to support and maintain internet-based products and services, and costs associated with the delivery of consulting services. cost of revenue in fiscal year 2006 increased mainly due to a $1.64 billion increase in home and entertainment as a result of an increase in the number of total xbox consoles sold and higher xbox 360 unit costs. cost of revenue in fiscal year 2005 decreased due to a $363 million decrease in stock-based compensation expense, a $140 million reduction in costs associated with a decrease in the msn internet access subscriber base, and a $169 million reduction in other product costs mainly due to xbox consoles cost efficiency, partially offset by increased costs in product support and consulting services costs.  research and development  \u00a0 research and development expenses include payroll, employee benefits, stock-based compensation expense, and other headcount-related costs associated with product development. research and development expenses also   \u00a0    table of contents \u00a0part ii\u00a0  item 7  \u00a0  include third-party development and programming costs, localization costs incurred to translate software for international markets, and the amortization of purchased software code and services content. research and development costs increased during fiscal year 2006 primarily due to increased development costs associated with new and upcoming offerings such as msn adcenter, the 2007 microsoft office system, windows vista, xbox 360, and corporate research activities. headcount-related costs increased 3% during fiscal year 2006 reflecting both a 17% increase in headcount and an increase in salaries and benefits for existing headcount, partially offset by a decrease in stock-based compensation expense. our research and development expenses decreased in fiscal year 2005 due to a $1.88 billion decrease in stock-based compensation expense. this expense decline was partially offset by increased headcount and product development costs associated with the xbox 360 console and related games, sql server 2005, windows vista, and product development in mobile and embedded devices.  sales and marketing  \u00a0 sales and marketing expenses include payroll, employee benefits, stock-based compensation expense and other headcount-related costs associated with sales and marketing personnel and advertising, promotions, trade shows, seminars, and other programs. sales and marketing expenses increased during fiscal year 2006 primarily due to increased headcount-related costs, investments in partner marketing and product launch-related spending. headcount-related costs increased 13% during fiscal year 2006 reflecting both a 20% increase in headcount and an increase in salaries and benefits for existing headcount, partially offset by a decrease in stock-based compensation expense.  for fiscal year 2005, sales and marketing expense increased slightly due to $470 million higher headcount-related costs from increased headcount and general salary increases; higher sales and marketing costs driven by product planning, reseller marketing, and advertising campaign costs mainly related to launch of the \u0093start something\u0094 campaign; launch of \u0093halo 2\u0094; and launch arrangements for xbox 360. the increase was offset mainly by a $660 million decrease in stock-based compensation expense.  general and administrative  \u00a0 general and administrative costs include payroll, employee benefits, stock-based compensation expense and other headcount-related costs associated with finance, legal, facilities, certain human resources, other administrative headcount, and legal and other administrative fees. general and administrative costs decreased in fiscal year 2006 primarily reflecting decreased costs for legal settlements and legal contingencies. we incurred $1.32 billion in legal charges during fiscal year 2006 as compared to $2.31 billion in legal charges incurred during fiscal year 2005. headcount-related costs increased 7% during the twelve months ended june\u00a030, 2006 reflecting both an 18% increase in headcount and an increase in salaries and benefits for existing headcount, partially offset by a decrease in stock-based compensation expense. general and administrative costs decreased in fiscal year 2005 primarily reflecting decreased stock-based compensation expense and decreased costs for legal settlements and legal contingencies. in fiscal year 2005, we recognized $277 million of stock-based compensation expense as compared to $664 million in fiscal year 2004. in fiscal year 2005, we recognized $2.31 billion in legal charges as compared to $2.83 billion in fiscal year 2004.  \u00a0  table of contents \u00a0part ii\u00a0  item 7  \u00a0 investment income and other  the components of investment income and other were as follows:  \u00a0 for fiscal year 2006, dividends and interest income increased due to higher interest rates received on our fixed-income investments, partially offset by a decline in the average balance of dividend and interest-bearing investments as a result of the $32.64 billion special dividend paid on december\u00a02, 2004, and stock repurchases made throughout fiscal year 2006. dividends and interest income declined $432 million in fiscal year 2005 due to the combination of a greater allocation of funds to lower yielding, more liquid asset classes in preparation for the $32.64 billion special dividend paid on december\u00a02, 2004, and a lower portfolio balance following payment of the special dividend.  for fiscal year 2006, net recognized gains on investments were comprised of net gains on sales of equity investments, net losses on sales of fixed-income investments and other-than-temporary impairments on both equity and fixed-income investments.\u00a0net recognized gains decreased in fiscal year 2006 primarily due to increased net losses on sales of fixed-income investments, higher other-than-temporary impairments and fewer net gains on equity investments in the current period as compared to fiscal year 2005. for fiscal year 2006, other-than-temporary impairments were $408 million, as compared to $152 million in fiscal year 2005. the increase in other-than-temporary impairments in fiscal year 2006 was driven by planned sales of certain investments in an unrealized loss position in order to raise funds for the $20 billion tender offer announced on july\u00a020, 2006. net gains on investments declined $707 million in fiscal year 2005 primarily due to greater sales of investments in the previous fiscal year in preparation for the special dividend paid on december\u00a02, 2004. net gains on investments also include other-than-temporary impairments of $152 million in fiscal year 2005 compared to $82 million in fiscal year 2004. net realized gains on sales were $1.65 billion in fiscal year 2004 as we moved to more liquid investment asset classes.  investments are considered to be impaired when a decline in fair value is judged to be other than temporary. we employ a systematic methodology that considers available evidence in evaluating potential impairment of our investments. if the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value, among other factors, we evaluate general market conditions, the duration and extent to which the fair value is less than cost, and our intent and ability to hold the investment. we also consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of and business outlook for the investee, including industry and sector performance, changes in technology, operational and financing cash flow factors, and rating agency actions. once a decline in fair value is determined to be other than temporary, an impairment charge is recorded and a new cost basis in the investment is established.  we lend certain fixed-income and equity securities to enhance investment income. the loaned securities continue to be carried as investments on our balance sheet.  we use derivative instruments to manage exposures to interest rates, equity prices, and foreign currency markets and to facilitate portfolio diversification. net losses on derivatives were as follows:  \u00a0 during fiscal year 2006, we experienced lower net losses on derivatives as compared to fiscal year 2005 primarily due to net gains on non-designated equity derivatives in the current fiscal year as compared to net losses in the prior   \u00a0    table of contents \u00a0part ii\u00a0  item 7  \u00a0  fiscal year and higher net gains on commodity positions in the current fiscal year driven by increases in the related commodity indices. these gains were partially offset by higher net losses in time value on foreign exchange contracts used to hedge anticipated foreign currency revenues and higher net losses on interest rate derivative contracts.  the net gains on equity derivatives during fiscal year 2006 are primarily due to changes in the market value of non-designated equity derivatives. gains and losses arising from non-designated derivatives are economically offset by unrealized losses and gains, respectively, in the underlying equity securities which are recorded as a component of other comprehensive income. commodity derivatives are held for the purpose of portfolio diversification. net losses related to foreign currency contracts relate primarily to changes in time value of options used to hedge anticipated foreign currency revenues. additionally, net gains and losses on foreign exchange contracts include the changes in the fair value of derivatives used as economic hedges. these gains and losses are partially offset economically by unrealized losses and gains, respectively, in the underlying assets which are included in other comprehensive income  net derivative losses in fiscal year 2005 were primarily related to losses on equity derivatives, interest rate derivatives, and foreign currency contracts. during fiscal year 2005, losses related to equity derivatives used to economically hedge against a decline in equity prices were $202 million and losses related to interest rate derivatives were $53 million. these losses were offset by the combination of realized gains on sales of securities and unrealized gains related to increases in the market value of the underlying assets included as a component of other comprehensive income. net losses related to foreign currency contracts were $53 million, related to changes in time value of options used to hedge anticipated foreign currency revenues and economically hedging foreign currency based investment exposures. losses related to hedging foreign currency-based investment exposures were offset by unrealized gains in the underlying assets which are included in other comprehensive income. net losses on derivatives also included gains related to commodity positions used to provide portfolio diversification. gains on commodity positions were $46 million during fiscal year 2005.  derivative losses were $268 million in fiscal year 2004 primarily due to net losses in time value on foreign exchange contracts used to hedge anticipated foreign currency revenues.  in the second quarter of fiscal year 2006, we entered into an agreement with nbc universal, inc. (\u0093nbc\u0094) that restructured our joint venture relationships for msnbc cable l.l.c. (\u0093cjv\u0094) and msnbc interactive news, l.l.c. (\u0093ijv\u0094). as a result, we divested 32% of cjv for $331 million and nbc acquired the right, exercisable in the following two years, to buy the remaining 18% interest. in addition, we modified our agreement with nbc to grant to ijv a u.s. content license and to remove the exclusivity obligation on both nbc and microsoft for local and non-u.s. news content. as part of the msnbc restructuring agreements, we paid a $200 million fee to effectively terminate ijv\u0092s prior content license agreement and we also prepaid the remaining $14 million license fee to nbc. in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2006, nbc exercised its option to buy our remaining 18% interest in cjv. for fiscal year 2006, we recognized a net gain of $195 million related to the above transactions.  income taxes  our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2006 was 31% as compared to 26% for fiscal year 2005. during fiscal year 2006, we recorded a tax benefit of $108 million from the resolution of state audits. the increased rate in fiscal year 2006 resulted primarily from the european commission fine of \u0080281 million ($351 million) which is not tax deductible, and a lower rate in fiscal year 2005 as a result of reversal of $776 million of previously accrued taxes upon settling an internal revenue service examination for fiscal year 1997 \u0096 1999 and a tax benefit of $179 million generated by the decision to repatriate foreign subsidiary earnings under a temporary incentive provided by the american jobs creation act of 2004. our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2004 was 33%.  financial condition  cash and equivalents and short-term investments totaled $34.16 billion and $37.75 billion as of june\u00a030, 2006, and 2005, respectively. this investment portfolio consists primarily of fixed-income securities, diversified among industries and individual issuers. our investments are generally liquid and investment grade. the portfolio is invested predominantly in u.s.-dollar-denominated securities, but also includes foreign currency positions in order to diversify financial risk. the portfolio is primarily invested in short-term securities to facilitate rapid deployment for immediate cash needs. equity and other investments were $9.23 billion and $11.00 billion as of june\u00a030, 2006, and 2005, respectively. as a result of the special dividend paid in the second quarter of fiscal year 2005 and shares repurchased, our retained deficit, including accumulated other comprehensive income, was $18.90 billion at june\u00a030, 2006. our retained deficit is not expected to impact our future ability to operate or pay dividends given our continuing profitability and strong cash and financial position.  \u00a0  table of contents \u00a0part ii\u00a0  item 7  \u00a0 unearned revenue  unearned revenue from volume licensing programs represents customer billings, paid either upfront or annually at the beginning of each billing coverage period, that are accounted for as subscriptions with revenue recognized ratably over the billing coverage period. for certain other licensing arrangements revenue attributable to undelivered elements, including free post-delivery telephone support and the right to receive unspecified upgrades/enhancements of microsoft internet explorer on a when-and-if-available basis, is based on the sales price of those elements when sold separately and is recognized ratably on a straight-line basis over the life cycle of the related product. other unearned revenue includes services, tv platform, microsoft business solutions, advertising, and subscriptions for which we have been paid upfront and earn the revenue when we provide the service or software or otherwise meet the revenue recognition criteria.  unearned revenue as of june\u00a030, 2006, increased $1.74 billion from june\u00a030, 2005, reflecting additions to unearned revenue from multi-year licensing that outpaced recognitions by $1.66 billion, a $53 million decrease in revenue deferred for undelivered elements, and a $127 million increase primarily in unearned revenue for services and subscription services.  the following table outlines the expected recognition of $10.9 billion of unearned revenue as of june\u00a030, 2006:  \u00a0 cash flows  cash flow from operations for fiscal year 2006 decreased 13% to $14.40 billion primarily due to increased payments to fund a $987 million increase in inventory and product costs related to xbox 360 and increased payments to employees resulting from a 16% growth in headcount. these factors were partially offset by increased cash receipts from customers driven by our 11% revenue growth and $1.74 billion increase in unearned revenue. cash used in financing was $20.56 billion in fiscal year 2006, a decrease of $20.52 billion from the previous year driven by a $32.57 billion reduction in cash dividend payments. this impact was partially offset by an $11.15 billion increase in common stock repurchases. net cash from investing was $8.00 billion in fiscal year 2006, a decrease of $7.02 billion from fiscal year 2005 driven primarily by an $8.93 billion decrease in cash from combined purchase, sales, and maturities of investments and a $766 million increase in additions to property and equipment. these factors were partially offset by $3.12 billion of cash proceeds from our securities lending program.  cash flow from operations for fiscal year 2005 increased 14% to $16.61 billion primarily due to an increase in cash receipts from customers driven by our 8% revenue growth combined with a 12% increase in unearned revenue. cash payments in fiscal year 2005 resulting from significant legal settlements were approximately $1.8 billion lower than in the previous year, adding to the overall increase in operating cash flow. partially offsetting these factors were increased payments to employees resulting from a 7% increase in full-time employees. cash used for financing was $41.08 billion in fiscal year 2005, driven by $36.11 billion of cash dividends paid in fiscal year 2005 compared to $1.73 billion paid in fiscal year 2004. the increase was also partially driven by $8.06 billion in cash used for common stock repurchases, an increase of $4.67 billion in cash used for share repurchases compared to the previous year, reflecting 312\u00a0million shares repurchased in fiscal year 2005, an increase of 188.5\u00a0million shares compared to the previous year. net cash from investing was $15.03 billion in fiscal year 2005, an increase of $18.37 billion from fiscal year 2004, primarily due to a $23.59 billion increase in investment maturities that occurred to fund cash dividends paid in fiscal year 2005, partially offset by a $5.32 billion decrease in cash from combined investment purchase and sale activity.  \u00a0    table of contents \u00a0part ii\u00a0  item 7  \u00a0 cash flow from operations for fiscal year 2004 decreased $1.17 billion to $14.63 billion. the decrease primarily reflects the combined cash outflows of $2.56 billion related to the sun microsystems settlement and the european commission fine partially offset by increased cash receipts from customers driven by the rise in revenue billings. cash used for financing was $2.36 billion in fiscal year 2004, a decrease of $2.86 billion from the previous year. the decrease reflects that we did not repurchase common stock in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2004 combined with a $628 million increase primarily from stock issuances related to employee stock options exercises, partially offset by an $872 million increase in cash dividends paid. we repurchased 123.7\u00a0million shares of common stock under our share repurchase program in fiscal year 2004. cash used for investing was $3.34 billion in fiscal year 2004, a decrease of $3.88 billion from fiscal year 2003.  we have no material long-term debt. stockholders\u0092 equity at june\u00a030, 2006, was $40.10 billion. we will continue to invest in sales, marketing, product support infrastructure, and existing and advanced areas of technology. additions to property and equipment will continue, including new facilities and computer systems for research and development, sales and marketing, support, and administrative staff. commitments for constructing new buildings were $234 million on june\u00a030, 2006. we have operating leases for most u.s. and international sales and support offices and certain equipment under which we incurred rental expense totaling $276 million, $299 million, and $331 million fiscal year 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. we have issued residual value guarantees in connection with various operating leases. these guarantees provide that if we do not purchase the leased property from the lessor at the end of the lease term, then we are liable to the lessor for an amount equal to the shortage (if any) between the proceeds from the sale of the property and an agreed value. as of june\u00a030, 2006, the maximum amount of the residual value guarantees was approximately $271 million. we believe that proceeds from the sale of properties under operating leases would exceed the payment obligation and therefore no liability currently exists. we have not engaged in any related party transactions or arrangements with unconsolidated entities or other persons that are reasonably likely to materially affect liquidity or the availability of requirements for capital resources.  in fiscal year 2006, our board of directors declared $0.35 per share cash dividends, with $2.69 billion paid as of june\u00a030, 2006. a quarterly dividend of $0.09 per share (or $906 million) was declared by our board of directors on june\u00a021, 2006 to be paid to shareholders of record as of august\u00a017, 2006, on september\u00a014, 2006.  on july\u00a020, 2006, we announced the completion of the repurchase program initially approved by our board of directors on july\u00a020, 2004 to buy back up to $30 billion in microsoft common stock. the repurchases were made using our cash resources. during fiscal year 2006, we repurchased 754\u00a0million shares, or $19.75 billion, of our common stock under this plan. on july\u00a020, 2006, we also announced that our board of directors authorized new share repurchase programs, comprised of a $20 billion tender offer which was completed on august\u00a017, 2006, and an additional $20 billion ongoing share repurchase program with an expiration of june\u00a030, 2011. under the tender offer, we repurchased approximately 155 million shares of our common stock, or approximately 1.5% of the common shares outstanding, for approximately $3.8 billion at a price per share of $24.75. on august 18, 2006, we announced that the authorization for the ongoing share repurchase program, previously announced on july 20, 2006, had been increased by approximately $16.2 billion. as a result, the company is authorized to repurchase additional shares in an amount up to $36.2 billion through june 30, 2011.  we believe existing cash and short-term investments, together with funds generated from operations should be sufficient to meet operating requirements, quarterly dividends and planned share repurchases. our philosophy regarding the maintenance of a balance sheet with a large component of cash and short-term investments, and equity and other investments, reflects our views on potential future capital requirements relating to research and development, creation and expansion of sales distribution channels, investments and acquisitions, share dilution management, legal risks, and challenges to our business model. we regularly assess our investment management approach in view of our current and potential future needs.  off-balance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations  off-balance sheet arrangements  we provide indemnifications of varying scope and amount to certain customers against claims of intellectual property infringement made by third parties arising from the use of our products. we evaluate estimated losses for such indemnifications under sfas no.\u00a05, accounting for contingencies, as interpreted by fasb interpretation no. (\u0093fin\u0094) 45, guarantor\u0092s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees, including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others. we consider factors such as the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the   \u00a0  table of contents \u00a0part ii\u00a0  item 7  \u00a0  ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss. to date, we have not encountered material costs as a result of such obligations and have not accrued any material liabilities related to such indemnifications in our financial statements.  contractual obligations  the following table summarizes our outstanding contractual obligations as of june\u00a030, 2006:  \u00a0 \u00a0 recently issued accounting standards  in november 2005, the fasb issued staff position (\u0093fsp\u0094) fas123(r)-3, transition election to accounting for the tax effects of share-based payment awards. this fsp requires an entity to follow either the transition guidance for the additional-paid-in-capital pool as prescribed in sfas no.\u00a0123(r), share-based payment, or the alternative transition method as described in the fsp. an entity that adopts sfas no.\u00a0123(r) using the modified prospective application may make a one-time election to adopt the transition method described in this fsp. an entity may take up to one year from the later of its initial adoption of sfas no.\u00a0123(r) or the effective date of this fsp to evaluate its available transition alternatives and make its one-time election. we elected to adopt the transition method as described in the fsp as of july\u00a01, 2005.\u00a0this method change did not have an impact on our financial statements.  in june 2006, the fasb issued fin no.\u00a048, accounting for uncertainty in income taxes \u0096 an interpretation of fasb statement no.\u00a0109, which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise\u0092s financial statements in accordance with fasb statement no.\u00a0109, accounting for income taxes. the interpretation prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. fin no.\u00a048 requires recognition of tax benefits that satisfy a greater than 50% probability threshold. fin no.\u00a048 also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure, and transition. fin no.\u00a048 is effective for us beginning july\u00a01, 2007. we are assessing the potential impact that the adoption of fin no.\u00a048 will have on our financial statements.  \u00a0    table of contents \u00a0part ii\u00a0  item 7  \u00a0 in june\u00a02006, the fasb ratified the emerging issues task force (\u0093eitf\u0094)\u00a0consensus on eitf issue no.\u00a006-2, \u0093accounting for sabbatical leave and other similar benefits pursuant to fasb statement no.\u00a043\u0094. eitf issue no.\u00a006-2 requires companies to accrue the costs of compensated absences under a sabbatical or similar benefit arrangement over the requisite service period. eitf issue no.\u00a006-2 is effective for us beginning july\u00a01, 2007. the cumulative effect of the application of this consensus on prior period results should be recognized through a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the year of adoption. elective retrospective application is also permitted. we are currently evaluating the financial impact of this guidance and the method of adoption that will be used.  application of critical accounting policies  our financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with u.s. gaap. preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. these estimates and assumptions are affected by management\u0092s application of accounting policies. critical accounting policies for us include revenue recognition, impairment of investment securities, impairment of goodwill, accounting for research and development costs, accounting for legal contingencies, accounting for income taxes, and accounting for stock-based compensation.  we account for the licensing of software in accordance with american institute of certified public accountants statement of position (\u0093sop\u0094) 97-2, software revenue recognition. the application of sop 97-2 requires judgment, including whether a software arrangement includes multiple elements, and if so, whether vendor-specific objective evidence (\u0093vsoe\u0094) of fair value exists for those elements. customers receive certain elements of our products over a period of time. these elements include free post-delivery telephone support and the right to receive unspecified upgrades/enhancements of microsoft internet explorer on a when-and-if-available basis, the fair value of which is recognized over the product\u0092s estimated life cycle. changes to the elements in a software arrangement, the ability to identify vsoe for those elements, the fair value of the respective elements, and changes to a product\u0092s estimated life cycle could materially impact the amount of earned and unearned revenue. judgment is also required to assess whether future releases of certain software represent new products or upgrades and enhancements to existing products.  sfas no.\u00a0115, accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities, and sec sab 59, accounting for noncurrent marketable equity securities, provide guidance on determining when an investment is other-than-temporarily impaired. investments are reviewed quarterly for indicators of other-than-temporary impairment. this determination requires significant judgment. in making this judgment, we employ a systematic methodology quarterly that considers available quantitative and qualitative evidence in evaluating potential impairment of our investments. if the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value, we evaluate, among other factors, general market conditions, the duration and extent to which the fair value is less than cost, and our intent and ability to hold the investment. we also consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of and business outlook for the investee, including industry and sector performance, changes in technology, operational and financing cash flow factors, and rating agency actions. once a decline in fair value is determined to be other-than-temporary, an impairment charge is recorded and a new cost basis in the investment is established. if market, industry, and/or investee conditions deteriorate, we may incur future impairments.  sfas no.\u00a0142, goodwill and other intangible assets, requires that goodwill be tested for impairment at the reporting unit level (operating segment or one level below an operating segment) on an annual basis (july 1 for us) and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. these events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate, legal factors, operating performance indicators, competition or sale or disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit. application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment, including the identification of reporting units, assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units, assignment of goodwill to reporting units, and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit. the fair value of each reporting unit is estimated using a discounted cash flow methodology. this requires significant judgments including estimation of future cash flows, which is dependent on internal forecasts, estimation of the long-term rate of growth for our business, the useful life over which cash flows will occur, and determination of our weighted average cost of capital. changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and/or goodwill impairment for each reporting unit. we allocate goodwill to reporting units based on the reporting unit expected benefit from the combination. we evaluate our reporting units on an annual basis and if necessary, reassign goodwill using a relative fair value allocation approach.  \u00a0  table of contents \u00a0part ii\u00a0  item 7  \u00a0 we account for research and development costs in accordance with several accounting pronouncements, including sfas no.\u00a02, accounting for research and development costs, and sfas no.\u00a086, accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold, leased, or otherwise marketed. sfas no.\u00a086 specifies that costs incurred internally in researching and developing a computer software product should be charged to expense until technological feasibility has been established for the product. once technological feasibility is established, all software costs should be capitalized until the product is available for general release to customers. judgment is required in determining when technological feasibility of a product is established. we have determined that technological feasibility for our software products is reached shortly before the products are released to manufacturing. costs incurred after technological feasibility is established have not been material, and accordingly, we have expensed all research and development costs when incurred.  the outcomes of legal proceedings and claims brought against us are subject to significant uncertainty. sfas no.\u00a05, accounting for contingencies, requires that an estimated loss from a loss contingency such as a legal proceeding or claim should be accrued by a charge to income if it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. disclosure of a contingency is required if there is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss has been incurred. in determining whether a loss should be accrued we evaluate, among other factors, the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss. changes in these factors could materially impact our financial position or our results of operations.  sfas no.\u00a0109, accounting for income taxes, establishes financial accounting and reporting standards for the effect of income taxes. the objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entity\u0092s financial statements or tax returns. judgment is required in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns. variations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could materially impact our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. accruals for tax contingencies are provided for in accordance with the requirements of sfas no.\u00a05.  we account for stock-based compensation in accordance with sfas no.\u00a0123(r), share-based payment. under the fair value recognition provisions of this statement, share-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the value of the award and is recognized as expense over the vesting period. determining the fair value of share-based awards at the grant date requires judgment, including estimating expected dividends. in addition, judgment is also required in estimating the amount of share-based awards that are expected to be forfeited. if actual results differ significantly from these estimates, stock-based compensation expense and our results of operations could be materially impacted.  \u00a0    table of contents \u00a0part ii\u00a0  item 7  \u00a0 statement of management\u0092s responsibility for financial statements  management is responsible for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements and related information that are presented in this report. the consolidated financial statements, which include amounts based on management\u0092s estimates and judgments, have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america.  the company maintains accounting and internal control systems to provide reasonable assurance at reasonable cost that assets are safeguarded against loss from unauthorized use or disposition, and that the financial records are reliable for preparing financial statements and maintaining accountability for assets. these systems are augmented by written policies, an organizational structure providing division of responsibilities, careful selection and training of qualified personnel and a program of internal audits.  the company engaged deloitte\u00a0& touche llp, independent auditors, to audit and render an opinion on the consolidated financial statements and management\u0092s report on its assessment and the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board (united states).  the board of directors, through its audit committee, consisting solely of independent directors of the company, meets periodically with management, internal auditors and our independent auditors to ensure that each is meeting its responsibilities and to discuss matters concerning internal controls and financial reporting. deloitte\u00a0& touche llp and the internal auditors each have full and free access to the audit committee.  \u00a0  table of contents \u00a0part ii\u00a0  item 7a  \u00a0 the following table sets forth the one-day var for substantially all of our positions as of june\u00a030, 2006 and 2005, and for the fiscal year ended june\u00a030, 2006:  \u00a0 total one-day var for the combined risk categories was $158 million at june\u00a030, 2006 and $195 million at june\u00a030, 2005. the total var is 38% less at june\u00a030, 2006 and 39% less at june, 30 2005 than the sum of the separate risk categories in the above table due to the diversification benefit of the combination of risks.  \u00a0  table of contents \u00a0part ii\u00a0  item 8  \u00a0 stockholders\u0092 equity statements  \u00a0 see accompanying notes.  \u00a0  table of contents \u00a0part ii\u00a0  item 8  \u00a0 notes to financial statements  note 1\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0accounting policies  accounting principles  the financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america.  principles of consolidation  the financial statements include the accounts of microsoft corporation and its subsidiaries. intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated. equity investments in which we exercise significant influence but do not control and are not the primary beneficiary are accounted for using the equity method. investments in which we are not able to exercise significant influence over the investee and which do not have readily determinable fair values are accounted for under the cost method.  estimates and assumptions  preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. examples include estimates of loss contingencies, product life cycles, and stock-based compensation forfeiture rates; assumptions such as the elements comprising a software arrangement, including the distinction between upgrades/enhancements and new products; when technological feasibility is achieved for our products; the potential outcome of future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns; estimating the fair value and/or goodwill impairment for our reporting units; and determining when investment impairments are other-than-temporary. actual results and outcomes may differ from management\u0092s estimates and assumptions.  we revised our expense classification policies during fiscal year 2006 which resulted in reclassifications of certain operating expenses. we have reclassified the prior period amounts to conform to the current year presentation. these reclassifications had no impact on total operating expenses, operating income and our net income.  foreign currencies  assets and liabilities recorded in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rate on the balance sheet date. revenue and expenses are translated at average rates of exchange prevailing during the year. translation adjustments resulting from this process are charged or credited to other comprehensive income (\u0093oci\u0094).  revenue recognition  revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the fee is fixed or determinable, and collectibility is probable. we enter into certain arrangements where we are obligated to deliver multiple products and/or services (multiple elements). in these arrangements, we generally allocate the total revenue among the elements based on the sales price of each element when sold separately (vendor-specific objective evidence).  revenue for retail packaged products, products licensed to original equipment manufacturers (\u0093oem\u0094), and perpetual licenses for current products under our open and select volume licensing programs generally is recognized as products are shipped, with a portion of the revenue recorded as unearned due to undelivered elements including, in some cases, free post-delivery telephone support and the right to receive unspecified upgrades/enhancements of microsoft internet explorer on a when-and-if-available basis. the amount of revenue allocated to undelivered elements is based on the vendor-specific objective evidence of fair value for those elements using the residual method. under the residual method, the total fair value of the undelivered elements, as indicated by vendor-specific objective evidence, is recorded as unearned, and the difference between the total arrangement fee and the amount recorded as unearned for the undelivered elements is recognized as revenue related to delivered elements. unearned revenue due to undelivered elements is recognized ratably on a straight-line basis over the related product\u0092s life cycle.  revenue from multi-year licensing arrangements are accounted for as subscriptions, with billings recorded as unearned revenue and recognized as revenue ratably over the billing coverage period. certain multi-year licensing   \u00a0    table of contents \u00a0part ii\u00a0  item 8  \u00a0  arrangements include rights to receive future versions of software product on a when-and-if-available basis under open and select volume licensing programs (software assurance). in addition, other multi-year licensing arrangements include a perpetual license for current products combined with rights to receive future versions of software products on a when-and-if-available basis under open, select, and enterprise agreement volume licensing programs. premier support services agreements, msn internet access subscriptions, xbox live, and microsoft developer network subscriptions are also accounted for as subscriptions.  revenue related to our xbox game console is recognized upon shipment of the product to retailers. revenue related to games published by us is recognized when those games have been delivered to retailers. revenue related to games published by third parties for use on the xbox platform is recognized when manufactured for the game publishers. online advertising revenue is recognized as advertisements are displayed. search advertising revenue is recognized when the ad appears in the search results or when the action necessary to earn the revenue has been completed. consulting services revenue is recognized as services are rendered, generally based on the negotiated hourly rate in the consulting arrangement and the number of hours worked during the period. revenue for fixed price services arrangements is recognized based on percentage of completion.  costs related to insignificant obligations, which include telephone support for developer tools software, pc games, computer hardware, and xbox, are accrued when the related revenue is recognized. provisions are recorded for estimated returns, concessions, and bad debts.  research and development  research and development expenses include payroll, employee benefits, stock-based compensation, and other headcount-related costs associated with product development. we have determined that technological feasibility for our software products is reached shortly before the products are released to manufacturing. costs incurred after technological feasibility is established have not been material, and accordingly, we have expensed all research and development costs when incurred.  sales and marketing  sales and marketing expenses include payroll, employee benefits, stock-based compensation, and other headcount-related costs associated with sales and marketing personnel and advertising, promotions, tradeshows, seminars, and other marketing-related programs. advertising costs are expensed as incurred. advertising expense was $1.23 billion in fiscal year 2006, $995 million in fiscal year 2005, and $904 million in fiscal year 2004.  income taxes  income tax expense includes u.s. and international income taxes, plus the provision for u.s. taxes on undistributed earnings of international subsidiaries not deemed to be permanently invested. certain items of income and expense are not reported in tax returns and financial statements in the same year. the tax effect of such temporary differences is reported as deferred income taxes.  financial instruments  we consider all highly liquid interest-earning investments with a maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase to be cash equivalents. in general, investments with original maturities of greater than three months and remaining maturities of less than one year are classified as short term investments. investments with maturities beyond one year may be classified as short-term based on their highly liquid nature and because such marketable securities represent the investment of cash that is available for current operations. all cash equivalents and short-term investments are classified as available for sale and are recorded at market value using the specific identification method; unrealized gains and losses (excluding other-than-temporary impairments) are reflected in oci.  equity and other investments may include both debt and equity instruments. debt securities and publicly traded equity securities are classified as available for sale and are recorded at market using the specific identification method. unrealized gains and losses (excluding other-than-temporary impairments) are reflected in oci. all other investments, excluding those accounted for using the equity method, are recorded at cost.  we lend certain fixed-income and equity securities to enhance investment income. the loaned securities continue to be carried as investments on our balance sheet. collateral and/or security interest is determined based upon the underlying security and the creditworthiness of the borrower. cash collateral is recorded as an asset with a corresponding liability.  \u00a0  table of contents \u00a0part ii\u00a0  item 8  \u00a0 investments are considered to be impaired when a decline in fair value is judged to be other-than-temporary. we employ a systematic methodology on a quarterly basis that considers available quantitative and qualitative evidence in evaluating potential impairment of our investments. if the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value, we evaluate, among other factors, general market conditions, the duration and extent to which the fair value is less than cost, and our intent and ability to hold the investment. we also consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of and business outlook for the investee, including industry and sector performance, changes in technology, operational and financing cash flow factors, and rating agency actions. once a decline in fair value is determined to be other-than-temporary, an impairment charge is recorded and a new cost basis in the investment is established.  we use derivative instruments to manage exposures to foreign currency, equity price, interest rate and credit risks, to enhance returns, and to facilitate portfolio diversification. our objectives for holding derivatives include reducing, eliminating, and efficiently managing the economic impact of these exposures as effectively as possible. derivative instruments are recognized as either assets or liabilities and are measured at fair value. the accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation. for a derivative instrument designated as a fair-value hedge, the gain or loss is recognized in earnings in the period of change together with the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item attributed to the risk being hedged. for a derivative instrument designated as a cash-flow hedge, the effective portion of the derivative\u0092s gain or loss is initially reported as a component of oci and is subsequently recognized in earnings when the hedged exposure affects earnings. the ineffective portion of the gain or loss is recognized in earnings. for options designated either as fair-value or cash-flow hedges, changes in the time value are excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and are recognized in earnings. gains and losses from changes in fair values of derivatives that are not designated as hedges for accounting purposes are recognized in earnings.  foreign currency risk.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0certain assets, liabilities, and forecasted transactions are exposed to foreign currency risk. we monitor our foreign currency exposures daily to maximize the overall effectiveness of our foreign currency hedge positions. options are used to hedge a portion of forecasted international revenue for up to three years in the future and are designated as cash-flow hedging instruments under statement of financial accounting standards (\u0093sfas\u0094) no.\u00a0133, accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities. principal currencies hedged include the euro, japanese yen, british pound, and canadian dollar. certain non-u.s. dollars denominated securities are hedged using foreign exchange forward contracts that are designated as fair-value hedging instruments under sfas no.\u00a0133. certain options and forwards not designated as hedging instruments under sfas no.\u00a0133 are also

interest rate risk. the fixed-income portfolio is diversified and consists primarily of investment grade securities to minimize credit risk. we use exchange-traded option and future contracts and over-the-counter swap contracts, not designated as hedging instruments under sfas no.\u00a0133, to hedge interest rate risk.  other derivatives.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0swap contracts, not designated as hedging instruments under sfas no.\u00a0133, are used to manage exposures to credit risks, enhance returns, and to facilitate portfolio diversification. in addition, we may invest in warrants to purchase securities of other companies as a strategic investment. warrants that can be net share settled are deemed derivative financial instruments and are not designated as hedging instruments. \u0093to be announced\u0094 forward purchase commitments of mortgage-backed assets are also considered derivatives in cases where physical delivery of the assets are not taken at the earliest

  table of contents \u00a0part ii\u00a0  item 8  \u00a0 allowance for doubtful accounts  the allowance for doubtful accounts reflects our best estimate of probable losses inherent in the accounts receivable balance. we determine the allowance based on known troubled accounts, historical experience, and other currently available evidence. activity in the allowance for doubtful accounts was as follows:  \u00a0 inventories  inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market, using the average cost method. cost includes materials, labor, and manufacturing overhead related to the purchase and production of inventories. we regularly review inventory quantities on hand, future purchase commitments with our suppliers, and the estimated utility of our inventory. if our review indicates a reduction in utility below carrying value, we reduce our inventory to a new cost basis.  property and equipment  property and equipment is stated at cost and depreciated using the straight-line method over the shorter of the estimated life of the asset or the lease term, ranging from one to 15 years. computer software developed or obtained for internal use is depreciated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the software, generally three years or less.  goodwill  goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis as of july\u00a01, and between annual tests if indicators of potential impairment exist, using a fair-value-based approach. no impairment of goodwill has been identified during any of the periods presented.  intangible assets  intangible assets are amortized using the straight-line method over their estimated period of benefit, ranging from one to ten years. we evaluate the recoverability of intangible assets periodically and take into account events or circumstances that warrant revised estimates of useful lives or that indicate that impairment exists. all of our intangible assets are subject to amortization. no impairments of intangible assets have been identified during any of the periods presented.  note 2\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0unearned revenue  unearned revenue is comprised of the following items:  volume licensing programs \u0096 represents customer billings for multi-year licensing arrangements, paid either upfront or annually at the beginning of each billing coverage period, which are accounted for as subscriptions with revenue recognized ratably over the billing coverage period.  undelivered elements \u0096 represents free post-delivery telephone support and the right to receive unspecified upgrades/enhancements of microsoft internet explorer on a when-and-if-available basis. the amount recorded as unearned is based on the sales price of those elements when sold separately and is recognized ratably on a straight-line basis over the related product\u0092s life cycle. the percentage of revenue recorded as unearned due to undelivered elements ranges from approximately 15% to 25% of the sales price for windows xp home, approximately 5% to 15% of the sales price for windows xp professional, and approximately 1% to 15% of the sales price for desktop applications, depending on the terms and conditions of the license and prices of the elements. product life cycles are currently estimated at three and one-half years for windows operating systems and two years for desktop applications.  \u00a0  table of contents \u00a0part ii\u00a0  item 8  \u00a0 other \u0096 represents payments for post-delivery support and consulting services to be performed in the future, online

to investments in high yield and emerging market fixed-income securities, $2 million related to domestic equity securities and $33 million related to international equity securities. unrealized losses from fixed-income securities are primarily attributable to changes in interest rates. unrealized losses from domestic and international equities are due to market price movements. at june\u00a030, 2005 unrealized losses of $258 million consisted of: $112 million related to investment grade fixed-income securities, $13 million related to investments in high yield and emerging market fixed income securities, $90 million related to domestic equity securities and $43 million related to international equity securities. unrealized losses from fixed-income securities are primarily attributable to changes in interest rates. unrealized losses from domestic and international equities are due to market price movements. management does not believe any unrealized losses represent an other-than-temporary impairment based on our evaluation of available evidence as of june\u00a030, 2006.  common and preferred stock and other investments that are restricted for more than one year or are not publicly traded are recorded at cost. at june\u00a030, 2006 the recorded basis of these investments was $41 million, and their estimated fair value was $41 million. at june\u00a030, 2005 the recorded basis of these investments was $1.05 billion, and their estimated fair value was $1.27 billion. the estimate of fair value is based on publicly available market information or other estimates determined by management.  the maturities of debt securities, including fixed maturity securities, at june\u00a030, 2006 were as follows:  \u00a0 note 4\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0investment income and

fiscal year 2005, and $82 million in fiscal year 2004. the increase in other-than-temporary impairments in fiscal year 2006 was driven by planned sales of certain investments in an unrealized loss position in order to raise funds for the $20 billion tender offer announced on july\u00a020, 2006. realized gains and (losses) from sales of available-for-sale securities (excluding other-than-temporary impairments) were $1.11 billion and $(531) million in fiscal year 2006, $1.38 billion and $(376) million in fiscal year 2005, and $2.16 billion and $(518) million in fiscal year 2004.  note 5\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0derivatives  for derivative instruments designated as hedges, hedge ineffectiveness, determined in accordance with sfas no.\u00a0133, accounting for derivative

year 2006, $217 million in gains on fair value hedges from changes in time value and $399 million in losses on cash flow hedges from changes in time value were excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and included in investment income and other. during fiscal year 2005, $79 million in gains on fair value hedges from changes in time value and $116 million in losses on cash flow hedges from changes in time value were excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and included in investment income and other. during fiscal year 2004, $31 million in gains on fair value hedges from changes in time value and $325 million in losses on cash flow hedges from changes in time value were excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and included in investment income and other.  derivative gains and losses included in oci are reclassified into earnings at the time forecasted revenue or the sale of an equity investment is recognized. during fiscal year 2006, $166 million of derivative gains were reclassified to revenue and $23 million in derivative gains were reclassified to investment income and other. during fiscal year 2005, $57 million of derivative gains were reclassified to revenue and $33 million in derivative gains were reclassified to investment income and other. during fiscal year 2004, $14 million of derivative gains were reclassified to revenue and no derivative gains or losses were reclassified to investment income and other.  we estimate that $133 million of net derivative gains included in oci will be reclassified into earnings within the next 12 months. no significant amounts of gains or losses were reclassified from oci into earnings as a result of forecasted transactions that failed to occur for fiscal years 2006, 2005, and 2004.

the applicable lease terms plus reasonably assured extensions, computer equipment and software range from two to three years, and furniture and equipment range from one to five years. land is not depreciated.  during fiscal years 2006, 2005, and 2004, depreciation expense was $863 million, $723 million, and $647 million, respectively. the majority of depreciation expense in all years related to computer equipment.  \u00a0  table of contents \u00a0part ii\u00a0  item 8  \u00a0 note 8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0goodwill  changes in the carrying amount of goodwill for fiscal years 2006 and 2005

the provisions of sfas no.\u00a0142, goodwill and other intangible assets. our annual testing resulted in no impairments of goodwill in fiscal years 2006 and 2005. if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value, goodwill will be evaluated for impairment between annual tests.  during fiscal year 2005, we had no material acquisitions. during the fiscal year 2006, we acquired the following entities for a total consideration of $689 million, which was primarily paid in cash:  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 as a result of these acquisitions, we recorded $592 million of goodwill. none of that amount is expected to be deductible for tax purposes. goodwill was assigned to our operating segments as follows: $29 million to server\u00a0& tools, $263 million to msn, $31 million to client, $246 million to information worker, and $23 million to home and entertainment. we also recorded $125 million of technology-based intangible assets with a weighted-average amortization period of 3.25 years, and $26 million of other intangible assets with a weighted-average amortization period of 4.5 years. all of the entities have been consolidated into our financial statements since their respective acquisition dates. none of the acquisitions, individually or in the aggregate, are

remanded by the ninth circuit court of appeals and the impact of the $605 million non-deductible european commission fine.  \u00a0    table of contents \u00a0part ii\u00a0  item 8  \u00a0 the components of the deferred tax assets and liabilities were as follows:  \u00a0 deferred income tax balances reflect the effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases and are stated at enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when taxes are actually paid or recovered.  we have not provided deferred u.s. income taxes or foreign withholding taxes on temporary differences of approximately $505 million resulting from earnings for certain non-u.s. subsidiaries which are permanently reinvested outside the united states. the amount of unrecognized deferred tax liability associated with these temporary differences is approximately $151 million.  the american jobs creation act of 2004 (the \u0093act\u0094) was enacted in october 2004. the act creates a temporary incentive for u.s. corporations to repatriate foreign subsidiary earnings by providing an elective 85% dividends received deduction for certain dividends from controlled foreign corporations. under these provisions, we repatriated approximately $780 million in dividends subject to the elective 85% dividends received deduction and we recorded a corresponding tax provision benefit of $179 million from the reversal of previously provided u.s. deferred tax liabilities on these unremitted foreign subsidiary earnings in 2005. the dividend was paid in june 2006.  income taxes paid were $4.8 billion in fiscal year 2006, $4.3 billion in fiscal year 2005, and $2.5 billion in fiscal year 2004.  tax contingencies.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0we are subject to income taxes in the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions. significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and recording the related assets and liabilities. in the ordinary course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. we are regularly under audit by tax authorities. accruals for tax contingencies are provided for in accordance with the requirements of sfas no.\u00a05, accounting for contingencies.  although we believe we have appropriate support for the positions taken on our tax returns, we have recorded a liability for our best estimate of the probable loss on certain of these positions, the non-current portion of which is included in other long-term liabilities. we believe that our accruals for tax liabilities are adequate for all open years, based on our assessment of many factors including past experience and interpretations of tax law applied to the facts of each matter, which matters result primarily from inter-company transfer pricing, restructuring of foreign   \u00a0  table of contents \u00a0part ii\u00a0  item 8  \u00a0  operations, tax benefits from the foreign sales corporation and extra territorial income tax rules, the amount of research and experimentation tax credits claimed, state income taxes, and certain other matters. although we believe our recorded assets and liabilities are reasonable, tax regulations are subject to interpretation and tax litigation is inherently uncertain; therefore our assessments can involve both a series of complex judgments about future events and rely heavily on estimates and assumptions. although we believe that the estimates and assumptions supporting our assessments are reasonable, the final determination of tax audit settlements and any related litigation could be materially different than that which is reflected in historical income tax provisions and recorded assets and liabilities. if we were to settle an audit or a matter under litigation, it could have a material effect on our income tax provision, net income, or cash flows in the period or periods for which that determination is made. due to the complexity involved we are not able to estimate the range of reasonably possible losses in excess of amounts recorded.  the internal revenue service (\u0093irs\u0094) has completed and closed its audits of our consolidated federal income tax returns through 1999. the irs is currently conducting an audit of our consolidated federal income tax return for tax years

method. because the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no.\u00a0123, stock-based compensation, and sfas no.\u00a0123(r) were materially consistent under our equity plans, the adoption of sfas no.\u00a0123(r) did not have a significant impact on our financial position or our results of operations. prior to our adoption of sfas no.\u00a0123(r), benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation costs were reported as operating cash flows. sfas no.\u00a0123(r) requires excess tax benefits be reported as a financing cash inflow rather than as a reduction of taxes paid.  the stock-based compensation and related income tax benefits were as follows:  \u00a0 employee stock purchase plan.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0we have an employee stock purchase plan for all eligible employees. compensation expense for the employee stock purchase plan is recognized in accordance with sfas no. 123(r). the administrative committee under the plan approved a change to the common stock purchase discount and approved the elimination of the related look back period and a change to quarterly purchase periods that became effective july\u00a01, 2004. as a result, beginning in fiscal year 2005, shares of our common stock may presently be purchased by employees at three-month intervals at 90% of the fair market value on the last day of each three-month period. employees may purchase shares having a value not exceeding 15% of their gross compensation during an offering period. during fiscal year 2006 employees purchased 17.2\u00a0million shares at an average price of $23.02 per share. at june\u00a030, 2006, 141.9\u00a0million shares were reserved for future issuance. during fiscal year 2005 employees purchased 16.4\u00a0million shares at average prices of $23.33 per share.  under the plan in effect previous to fiscal year 2005, shares of our common stock could be purchased at six month intervals at 85% of the lower of the fair market value on the first or the last day of each six-month period. employees could purchase shares having a value not exceeding 15% of their gross compensation during an offering period. during fiscal year 2004 employees purchased 16.7\u00a0million shares at average prices of $22.74 per share.  savings plan.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0we have a savings plan in the united states that qualifies under section\u00a0401(k) of the internal revenue code, and a number of savings plans in international locations. participating u.s. employees may contribute up to 50% of their pretax salary, but not more than statutory limits. we contribute fifty cents for each dollar a participant contributes in this plan, with a maximum contribution of 3% of a participant\u0092s earnings. matching contributions for all plans were $178 million, $154 million, and $141 million in fiscal years 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively. matching contributions are invested proportionate to each participant\u0092s voluntary contributions in the investment options provided under the plan. investment options in the u.s. plan include microsoft common stock, but neither participant nor our matching contributions are required to be invested in microsoft common stock.  \u00a0    table of contents \u00a0part ii\u00a0  item 8  \u00a0 stock plans.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0we have stock plans for directors and for officers, employees, consultants, and advisors. at june\u00a030, 2006, an aggregate of 812\u00a0million shares were authorized for future grant under our stock plans, which cover stock options, stock awards, and shared performance stock awards. awards that expire or are canceled without delivery of shares generally become available for issuance under the plans. the options transferred to jpmorgan chase bank (\u0093jpmorgan\u0094) (see below) in fiscal year 2004 have been removed from our plans; any options transferred to jpmorgan that expire without being exercised will not become available for grant under any of our plans.  on november\u00a09, 2004, our shareholders approved amendments to the stock plans that allowed our board of directors to adjust eligible options, unvested stock awards, and shared performance stock awards to maintain their pre-dividend value after the $3.00 special dividend. additional awards were granted for options, stock awards, and shared performance stock awards by the ratio of post- and pre-special dividend stock price as of the ex-dividend date. strike prices for options were decreased by the same ratio. stock-based compensation was not affected by this adjustment. as a result of this approval and payment of the $3.00 special dividend on december\u00a02, 2004, an adjustment to the prices and number of shares of existing awards was made resulting in a total of 96\u00a0million options and 6.7\u00a0million stock awards being issued to adjust the outstanding awards. in addition, the target shared performance stock awards were increased by 3.5\u00a0million shares.  we issue new shares to satisfy stock option exercises. on july\u00a020, 2006, we announced the completion of the repurchase program initially approved by our board of directors on july\u00a020, 2004 to buy back up to $30 billion in microsoft common stock.  stock awards and shared performance stock awards.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0stock awards are grants that entitle the holder to shares of common stock as the award vests. our stock awards generally vest over a five-year period.  shared performance stock awards (\u0093spsas\u0094) are a form of stock award in which the number of shares ultimately received depends on our business performance against specified performance targets. the performance period for spsas issued in fiscal years 2004, 2005, and 2006 was july\u00a01, 2003 through june\u00a030, 2006 (january\u00a01, 2004 through june\u00a030, 2006 for certain executive officers). following the end of the performance period, the board of directors determined that the number of shares of stock awards to be issued was 37.0 million, based on the actual performance against metrics established for the performance period. one-third of the awards will vest in the first quarter of fiscal year 2007. an additional one-third of the awards will vest over each of the following two years. because the spsas covered a three-year period, spsas issued in fiscal year 2005 and 2006 were given only to newly hired and promoted employees eligible to receive spsas.  the company will grant spsas for fiscal year 2007 with a performance period of july\u00a01, 2006 through june\u00a030, 2007. at the end of the performance period, the number of shares of stock subject to the award will be determined by multiplying the target award by a percentage ranging from 0% to 150%. the percentage will be determined based on performance against metrics for the performance period, as determined by the compensation committee of the board of directors in its sole discretion. an additional 15% of the total stock and stock awards will be available as additional awards to participants based on individual performance. one-quarter of the shares of stock subject to each award will vest following the end of the performance period, and an additional one-quarter of the shares will vest over each of the following three years.  we measure the fair value of sas and spsas based upon the market price of the underlying common stock as of the date of grant, reduced by the present value of estimated future dividends. sas and spsas are amortized over their applicable vesting period (generally five years) using the straight-line method. the fair value of each award grant is estimated on the date of grant using the following assumptions:  \u00a0 the dividend per share amounts for fiscal year 2006 and fiscal year 2005 are quarterly dividend amounts. the dividend amount of $0.16 was the total dividend per share for fiscal year 2004.  \u00a0  table of contents \u00a0part ii\u00a0  item 8  \u00a0 during fiscal year 2006, the following activity occurred under our existing plans:  \u00a0 as of june\u00a030, 2006, there were $1.69 billion and $383 million of total unrecognized compensation costs related to sas and spsas, respectively. these costs are expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 3.1 years and 2.2 years, respectively.  during the 12 months ended june\u00a030, 2005 and june\u00a030, 2004, the following activity occurred under our plans:  \u00a0 stock options.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0in fiscal year 2004, we began granting employees stock awards rather than stock options as part of our equity compensation plans. since then, stock options issued to employees have been issued primarily in conjunction with business acquisitions. nonqualified stock options were granted to our directors under our non-employee director stock plan. nonqualified and incentive stock options were granted to our officers and employees under our employee stock plans. options granted between 1995 and 2001 generally vest over four and one-half years and expire seven years from the date of grant, while certain options vest either over four and one-half years or over seven and one-half years and expire ten years from the date of grant. options granted after 2001 vest over four and one-half years and expire ten years from the date of grant. approximately 2.9\u00a0million stock options were granted in conjunction with business acquisitions during fiscal year 2006. no stock options were granted during the year ended june\u00a030, 2005. in fiscal year 2004, approximately two\u00a0million stock options were granted, nearly all of which were granted in conjunction with business acquisitions.  during fiscal year 2004, we completed an employee stock option transfer program whereby employees could elect to transfer all of their vested and unvested options with a strike price of $33.00 or higher to jpmorgan. the options transferred to jpmorgan were amended and restated upon transfer to contain terms and conditions typical of equity option transactions entered into between sophisticated financial counterparties at arm\u0092s length using standard terms and definitions for equity derivatives. as a result of this program, we recorded additional stock-based compensation expense of $2.21 billion ($1.48 billion after-tax or $0.14 per diluted share) which was recorded in the second quarter of fiscal year 2004. as of june\u00a030, 2006, 237\u00a0million options transferred to jpmorgan remained outstanding but are excluded from the table below. these options have strike prices ranging from $28.60 to $89.58 per share and have expiration dates extending through december 2006.  \u00a0    table of contents \u00a0part ii\u00a0  item 8  \u00a0 employee stock options outstanding were as follows:  \u00a0 included in the options outstanding balance are approximately five million options that were granted in conjunction with business acquisitions. while these options are included in the options outstanding balance, they are excluded from the weighted average exercise prices presented. these options have an exercise price range of $0 to $150.93 and a weighted average exercise price of $11.26.  as of june\u00a030, 2006, there were $402 million of total unrecognized compensation costs related to stock options. these costs are expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately one year.  during fiscal years 2006, 2005, and 2004 the following activity occurred under our plans:  \u00a0 cash received and income tax benefit from stock option exercises for fiscal year 2006 were $1.71 billion and $183 million, respectively.  note 15\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0earnings per share  basic earnings per share is computed on the basis of the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. diluted earnings per share is computed on the basis of the weighted average number of shares of common stock plus the effect of dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period using the treasury stock method. dilutive potential common shares include outstanding stock options, stock awards, and shared performance stock awards. the components of basic and diluted earnings per share are as follows:  \u00a0 \u00a0  table of contents \u00a0part ii\u00a0  item 8  \u00a0 for the years ended june\u00a030, 2006, 2005, and 2004, 649\u00a0million, 854\u00a0million, and 1.2 billion shares, respectively, were attributable to outstanding stock options and were excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per share because the exercise prices of the stock options were greater than or equal to the average price of the common shares, and therefore their inclusion would have been anti-dilutive. for the year ended june\u00a030, 2006, 1.2\u00a0million shared performance stock awards, out of the 36.6\u00a0million targeted amount outstanding, have been excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per share because the number of shares ultimately issued is contingent on our performance against metrics established for the performance period, as discussed in note 14 \u0096 employee stock and savings plans.  note 16\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0commitments and guarantees  we have operating leases for most u.s. and international sales and support offices and certain equipment. rental expense for operating leases was $276 million, $299 million, and $331 million, in fiscal years 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively. future minimum rental commitments under noncancellable leases are as follows:  \u00a0 we have committed $234 million for constructing new buildings.  in connection with various operating leases, we issued residual value guarantees, which provide that if we do not purchase the leased property from the lessor at the end of the lease term, then we are liable to the lessor for an amount equal to the shortage (if any) between the proceeds from the sale of the property and an agreed value. as of june\u00a030, 2006, the maximum amount of the residual value guarantees was approximately $271 million. we believe that proceeds from the sale of properties under operating leases would exceed the payment obligation and therefore no liability to us currently exists.  we provide indemnifications of varying scope and size to certain customers against claims of intellectual property infringement made by third parties arising from the use of our products. in addition, we also provide indemnification against credit risk in several geographical locations to our volume license resellers in case the resellers fail to collect from the end user. due to the nature of the indemnification provided to our resellers, we cannot estimate the fair value, nor determine the total nominal amount of the indemnification. we evaluate estimated losses for such indemnifications under sfas no.\u00a05, accounting for contingencies, as interpreted by fin no. 45, guarantor\u0092s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees, including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others. we consider such factors as the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss. to date, we have not encountered material costs as a result of such obligations and have not accrued any liabilities related to such indemnifications in our financial statements.  our product warranty accrual reflects management\u0092s best estimate of our probable liability under its product warranties (primarily relating to the xbox console). we determine the warranty accrual based on known product failures (if any), historical experience, and other currently available evidence. our warranty accrual totals $10 million as of june\u00a030, 2006. there has been no significant activity impacting the results of operations for any period presented.  note 17\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0contingencies  government competition law matters.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0on march\u00a025, 2004, the european commission issued a decision in its competition law investigation of us. the commission concluded that we infringed european competition law by refusing to provide our competitors with licenses to certain protocol technology in the windows server operating systems and by including streaming media playback functionality in windows desktop operating systems. the commission ordered us to make the relevant licenses to our technology available to our competitors and to develop   \u00a0    table of contents \u00a0part ii\u00a0  item 8  \u00a0  and make available a version of the windows desktop operating system that does not include specified software relating to media playback. the decision also imposed a fine of \u0080497 million, which resulted in a charge in the third quarter of fiscal year 2004 of \u0080497 million ($605 million). we filed an appeal of the decision to the court of first instance on june\u00a06, 2004. on december\u00a022, 2004, the court ordered that we must comply with the decision pending review on appeal and we are taking steps to ensure we are in compliance. the hearing on the appeal occurred in april 2006. we continue to contest the conclusion that european competition law was infringed and will defend our position vigorously. in december 2005, the commission issued a statement of objections that preliminarily concluded we were not in full compliance with the 2004 decree. in march 2006, the commission conducted an oral hearing on the statement of objections and our response to the statement. on july\u00a012, 2006, the european commission announced its determination that we had not complied with the technical documentation requirements of the 2004 decision, and levied a fine of \u0080281 million ($351 million). we will appeal this fine to the court of first instance.  on december\u00a07, 2005, the korean fair trade commission (\u0093kftc\u0094) announced a ruling in its investigation of us, holding that we abused a market dominant position and engaged in unfair trade practices under the korean fair trade law by incorporating instant messaging and media player functionality into the windows pc operating system, and streaming media technologies into the windows server operating system. the kftc also announced the imposition of remedies, including a fine of approximately $34 million. the kftc issued its formal written ruling and corrective order on february\u00a023, 2006. the kftc held that our integration of windows media player and windows messenger in windows pc operating systems and integration of windows media services in windows server operating systems constituted an abuse of monopoly power and unlawful tying in violation of the korean fair trade act. under the order, which became effective august\u00a024, 2006, we can no longer distribute windows in korea as currently designed. we are required to develop and distribute in korea versions of windows xp and its successors that do not include windows media player or windows messenger functionality. in addition, we also may distribute a second modified version of windows that contains the removed functionality, provided the second version includes promotional links in the user interface that will enable consumers to link to and download a select group of competing media players and instant messengers. we have appealed the kftc\u0092s decision to the seoul high court. on may\u00a022, 2006, the kftc denied our motion for reconsideration of its ruling. as part of that decision, the kftc dropped the element of its ruling that prohibited us from including windows media player or windows messenger, or any feature with similar functionality, in any product other than the windows client operating system for which we have a 50% or greater market share. on august 23, 2006, we announced the release to manufacture of the mandated versions of windows xp home edition and windows xp professional edition.  in other ongoing investigations, various foreign governments and several state attorneys general have requested information from us concerning competition, privacy, and security issues.  antitrust, and unfair competition, and overcharge class actions.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0a large number of antitrust and unfair competition class action lawsuits have been filed against us in various state and federal courts on behalf of variously defined classes of direct and indirect purchasers of our pc operating system and certain software applications products. the federal cases have been consolidated in the u.s. district court for maryland. these cases allege that we competed unfairly and unlawfully monopolized alleged markets for operating systems and certain software applications, and they seek to recover alleged overcharges for these products. to date, courts have dismissed all claims for damages in cases brought against us by indirect purchasers under federal law and in 18 states. ten of those state court decisions have been affirmed on appeal. there was no appeal in five states. in addition, courts in two states refused to certify classes, essentially bringing the litigation to a close. claims under federal law brought on behalf of foreign purchasers have been dismissed by the u.s. district court in maryland as have all claims brought on behalf of consumers seeking injunctive relief under federal law. the ruling on injunctive relief and the ruling dismissing the federal claims of indirect purchasers were appealed to the united states court of appeals for the fourth circuit, together with a ruling denying certification of certain proposed classes of u.s. direct purchasers. on april\u00a018, 2006, the court of appeals affirmed the trial court decision dismissing the indirect purchaser claims. courts in 18 states have ruled that indirect purchaser cases may proceed as class actions. in 2003, we reached an agreement with counsel for the california plaintiffs to settle all claims in 27 consolidated cases in that state. under the settlement, class members will be able to obtain vouchers that entitle the class members to be reimbursed up to the face value of their vouchers for purchases of a wide variety of platform-neutral computer hardware and software. the total value of vouchers issued will depend on the number of class members who make a claim and are issued vouchers. two-thirds of the value of vouchers unissued or unredeemed by class members will be made available to certain   \u00a0  table of contents \u00a0part ii\u00a0  item 8  \u00a0  schools in california in the form of vouchers that also may be redeemed for cash against purchases of a wide variety of platform-neutral computer hardware, software, and related services. we also have reached similar agreements to settle all claims in a number of other states. the settlements in these states are structured similarly to the california settlement, except that, among other differences, one-half of the value of vouchers unissued to class members will be made available to certain schools in the relevant states. the maximum value of vouchers to be issued in these settlements, including the california settlement, is approximately $2.5 billion. the actual costs of these settlements will be less than that maximum amount, depending on the number of class members and schools who are issued and redeem vouchers. the settlements in arizona, california, the district of columbia, florida, kansas, massachusetts, minnesota, montana, nebraska, new mexico, new york, north carolina, north dakota, south dakota, tennessee, vermont, and west virginia have received final court approval. we estimate the total cost to resolve all of these cases will range between $1.5 billion and $1.7 billion, with the actual cost dependent upon many unknown factors such as the quantity and mix of products for which claims will be made, the number of eligible class members who ultimately use the vouchers, the nature of hardware and software that is acquired using the vouchers, and the cost of administering the claims process. in accordance with sfas no.\u00a05, accounting for contingencies, and fin no.\u00a014, reasonable estimation of the amount of a loss, at june\u00a030, 2006, we have recorded a liability related to these claims of approximately $1.2 billion, which reflects our estimated exposure of $1.5 billion less payments made to date of approximately $300 million, primarily for administrative expenses and legal fees.  other antitrust litigation and claims.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0on august\u00a027, 2004, the city and county of san francisco, the city of los angeles, and los angeles, san mateo, contra costa, and santa clara counties filed a putative class action against us in san francisco superior court. the action was brought on behalf of all governmental entities, agencies, and political subdivisions of the state of california that indirectly purchased our operating system or word processing and spreadsheet software during the period from february\u00a018, 1995 to the date of trial in the action. the plaintiffs sought treble damages under california\u0092s cartwright act and disgorgement of unlawful profits under its unfair competition act resulting from our alleged combinations to restrain trade, deny competition, and monopolize the world markets for pc operating systems and word processing and spreadsheet applications (and productivity suites including these applications). we removed the case to the u.s. district court for maryland. our motion to dismiss the complaint was granted on april\u00a018, 2005 with leave to file an amended complaint alleging claims under the cartwright act based on conduct within the four-year statute of limitation the court ruled applies to the plaintiffs\u0092 claims. we have obtained final approval of settlement of this case, which resolves all claims asserted in the lawsuit.  on november\u00a012, 2004, novell, inc. filed a complaint in the u.s. district court for utah asserting antitrust and unfair competition claims against us related to novell\u0092s ownership of wordperfect and other productivity applications during the period between june 1994 and march 1996. on june\u00a010, 2005, the trial court granted our motion to dismiss four of six claims of the complaint. an appeal of that ruling is now pending and the case is effectively stayed during the appeal.  patent and intellectual property claims.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0we are a defendant in more than 35 patent infringement cases that we are defending vigorously. in the case of eolas technologies, inc. and university of california v. microsoft, filed in the u.s. district court for the northern district of illinois on february\u00a02, 1999, the plaintiffs alleged infringement by the browser functionality of windows. on august\u00a011, 2003, the jury awarded the plaintiffs approximately $520 million in damages for infringement from the date the plaintiffs\u0092 patent was issued through september 2001. the plaintiffs are seeking an equitable accounting for damages from september 2001 to the present. on january\u00a014, 2004, the trial court entered final judgment of $565 million, including post-trial interest of $45 million, and entered an injunction against distribution of any new infringing products, but stayed execution of the judgment and the injunction pending our appeal. we appealed and on march\u00a02, 2005 the court of appeals for the federal circuit reversed the decision and vacated the judgment, ruling that the trial court had erred in excluding certain previous art evidence and ruling as a matter of law on other evidence. the appellate court also reversed the trial court\u0092s decision that the inventors had not engaged in inequitable conduct by failing to reveal material previous art while obtaining the patent. we believe the total cost to resolve this case will not be material to our financial position or results of operations. the actual costs will be dependent upon many unknown factors such as the events of a retrial of the plaintiff\u0092s claims. in microsoft v. lucent, filed in the u.s. district court in san diego on april\u00a08, 2003, we are seeking a declaratory judgment that we do not infringe any valid patent among a number of patents lucent has been asserting against computer manufacturers that sell computers with our software pre-installed. the first in a series of back-to-back trials on the various patent groupings is currently set to begin on november\u00a020, 2006. on march\u00a028, 2006, lucent filed a new lawsuit against us in u.s. district court in san diego, claiming that xbox 360 violates one of the patents that earlier   \u00a0    table of contents \u00a0part ii\u00a0  item 8  \u00a0  had been dismissed from the older lawsuit. in response to lucent\u0092s new complaint, we asserted patent infringement counterclaims accusing lucent of infringing ten microsoft patents by its sales of various products. no trial date has been set in the new lawsuit. in amado v. microsoft, filed in u.s. district court for the central district of california on march\u00a07, 2003, the plaintiff has accused the link table functionality available in microsoft access when used with microsoft excel. after a jury trial, we were found to infringe one claim of the patent and damages of $8.9 million were awarded. the judge later found for us on our defense of laches, which reduced the damages award to $5.9 million. the court also imposed an injunction against further distribution of the accused feature as part of microsoft access, but stayed the injunction pending resolution of all appeals. the court of appeals for the federal circuit affirmed the judgment on appeal and microsoft intends to seek review by the u.s. supreme court of one issue. in z4 technologies, inc. v. microsoft, the plaintiff alleged that microsoft windows and office product activation functionality violates its patent rights. in april 2006, the jury rendered a $115 million verdict against us. in august 2006, the trial court increased damages by $25 million pursuant to the jury\u0092s finding of willful infringement. we intend to appeal the verdict. in veritas operating corporation v. microsoft, filed in the u.s. district court for the western district of washington on may 18, 2006, a subsidiary of symantec has filed an action asserting claims of trade secret misappropriation, breach of contract, and patent infringement relating to certain storage technologies. adverse outcomes in some or all of the matters described in this paragraph may result in significant monetary damages or injunctive relief against us, adversely affecting distribution of our operating system or application products. the risks associated with an adverse decision may result in material settlements.  other.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0we are also subject to a variety of other claims and suits that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of our business. while management currently believes that resolving claims against us, individually or in aggregate, will not have a material adverse impact on our financial position, our results of operations, or our cash flows, these matters are subject to inherent uncertainties and management\u0092s view of these matters may change in the future.  as of june\u00a030, 2006, we had accrued aggregate liabilities totaling $1.0 billion in other current liabilities and $1.0 billion in other long-term liabilities for all of the contingent matters described in this note. while we intend to vigorously defend these matters, there exists the possibility of adverse outcomes which we estimate could be up to $1.0 billion in aggregate beyond recorded amounts. were an unfavorable final outcome to occur, there exists the possibility of a material adverse impact on the company\u0092s financial position and on the results of operations for the period in which the effect becomes reasonably estimable.  note 18\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0segment information  segment revenue and operating income/(loss) was as follows:  \u00a0 \u00a0  table of contents \u00a0part ii\u00a0  item 8  \u00a0 sfas no.\u00a0131, disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information, establishes standards for reporting information about operating segments. this standard requires segmentation based on our internal organization and reporting of revenue and operating income based upon internal accounting methods. our financial reporting systems present various data for management to operate the business, including internal profit and loss statements prepared on a basis not consistent with u.s. gaap. fiscal years 2005 and 2004 amounts have been restated for certain internal reorganizations and to conform to the current period presentation. the segments are designed to allocate resources internally and provide a framework to determine management responsibility. operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise about which separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker, or decision making group, in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance. our chief operating decision maker is our chief executive officer. our seven segments are client; server and tools; information worker; microsoft business solutions; msn; mobile and embedded devices; and home and entertainment. on july\u00a017, 2006 we announced a change in our operating segments reflecting the culmination of our realignment announced in september 2005. these changes will be effective for fiscal year 2007; the seven segments discussed in this analysis are presented the way we internally managed and monitored performance at the business group level in fiscal years 2006, 2005, and 2004.  the types of products and services provided by each segment are summarized below:  client\u00a0\u0096\u00a0windows xp professional and home; media center edition; tablet pc edition; and other standard windows operating systems.  server and tools\u00a0\u0096windows server operating

windows embedded device operating system; and windows automotive.  home and entertainment\u00a0\u0096\u00a0xbox 360; xbox; xbox live; cpxg (consumer software and hardware products); and iptv.  because of our integrated business structure, operating costs included in one segment may benefit other segments, and therefore these segments are not designed to measure operating income or loss directly related to the products included in each segment. inter-segment cost commissions are estimated by management and used to compensate or charge each segment for such shared costs and to incent shared efforts. management will continually   \u00a0    table of contents \u00a0part ii\u00a0  item 8  \u00a0  evaluate the alignment of product development organizations, sales organizations, and inter-segment commissions for segment reporting purposes, which may result in changes to segment allocations in future periods.  assets are not allocated to segments for internal reporting presentations. a portion of amortization and depreciation is included with various other costs in an overhead allocation to each segment and it is impracticable for us to separately identify the amount of amortization and depreciation by segment that is included in the measure of segment profit or loss.  reconciling amounts include adjustments to conform with u.s. gaap and corporate-level activity not specifically attributed to a segment. significant internal accounting policies that differ from u.s. gaap relate to revenue recognition, income statement classification, period-end cut-off timing, and accelerated amortization for depreciation, stock awards, and performance-based stock awards. in addition, certain revenue and expenses are excluded from segments or included in corporate-level activity including certain legal settlements and accruals for legal contingencies.  significant reconciling items were as follows:  \u00a0 \u00a0 sales to dell and its subsidiaries in the aggregate accounted for approximately 11% of fiscal year 2006 and 10% of total fiscal year 2005 and 2004 revenue. these sales were made primarily through our oem and volume licensing channels and were included in all operating segments.  revenue, classified by the major geographic areas in which our customers are located, were as follows:  \u00a0 \u00a0 long-lived assets, classified by the geographic location of the controlling statutory company in which that company operates, were as follows:  \u00a0 \u00a0  table of contents \u00a0part ii\u00a0  item 8  \u00a0 note

decision in its competition law investigation. as of june\u00a030, 2006, the total amount of the fine was included in other current liabilities.  on july\u00a020, 2006, we announced that our board of directors authorized two new share repurchase programs, comprised of a $20 billion tender offer which was completed on august\u00a017, 2006, and an additional $20 billion ongoing share repurchase program with an expiration of june\u00a030, 2011. under the tender offer, we repurchased approximately 155 million shares of our common stock, or approximately 1.5% of our common stock outstanding, for approximately $3.8 billion at a per share price of $24.75.  on august 18, 2006, we announced that the authorization for the ongoing share repurchase program, previously announced on july\u00a020, 2006, had been increased by approximately $16.2 billion. as a result, the company is authorized to repurchase additional shares in an amount up to $36.2 billion through june\u00a030, 2011.  \u00a0    table of contents \u00a0part ii\u00a0  item 8  \u00a0 report of independent registered public accounting firm  to the board of directors and stockholders of microsoft corporation:  we have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of microsoft corporation and subsidiaries (the \u0093company\u0094) as of june\u00a030, 2006 and 2005, and the related consolidated statements of income, cash flows, and stockholders\u0092 equity for each of the three years in the period ended june\u00a030, 2006. these financial statements are the responsibility of the company\u0092s management. our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.  we conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board (united states). those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. an audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. an audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. we believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.  in our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of microsoft corporation and subsidiaries as of june\u00a030, 2006 and 2005, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended june\u00a030, 2006, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america.  we have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board (united states), the effectiveness of the company\u0092s internal control over financial reporting as of june\u00a030, 2006, based on the criteria established in internal control-integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission and our report dated august\u00a022,

executive officer and chief financial officer have concluded that these disclosure controls and procedures are effective.   report of management on internal control over financial reporting  our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for the company. internal control over financial reporting is a process to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america. internal control over financial reporting includes maintaining records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect our transactions; providing reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary for preparation of our financial statements; providing reasonable assurance that receipts and expenditures of company assets are made in accordance with management authorization; and providing reasonable assurance that unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of company assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements would be prevented or detected on a timely basis. because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting is not intended to provide absolute assurance that a misstatement of our financial statements would be prevented or detected.  management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in internal control \u0096 integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission. based on this evaluation, management concluded that the company\u0092s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of june\u00a030, 2006. there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended june\u00a030, 2006 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. deloitte\u00a0& touche llp has audited this assessment of our internal control over financial reporting; their report is included in item\u00a09a.  \u00a0  table of contents \u00a0part ii\u00a0  item 9a  \u00a0  report of independent registered public accounting firm  to the board of directors and stockholders of microsoft corporation:  we have audited management\u0092s assessment, included in the accompanying report of management on internal control over financial reporting, that microsoft corporation and subsidiaries (the \u0093company\u0094) maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of june\u00a030, 2006, based on criteria established in internal control-integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission. the company\u0092s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. our responsibility is to express an opinion on management\u0092s assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the company\u0092s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.  we conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board (united states). those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, evaluating management\u0092s assessment, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. we believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinions.  a company\u0092s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company\u0092s principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the company\u0092s board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. a company\u0092s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1)\u00a0pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2)\u00a0provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3)\u00a0provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company\u0092s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.  because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.  in our opinion, management\u0092s assessment that the company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of june\u00a030, 2006, is fairly stated, in all material respects, based on the criteria established in internal control-integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission. also in our opinion, the company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of june\u00a030, 2006, based on the criteria established in internal control-integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission.  we have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board (united states), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended june\u00a030, 2006 of the company and our report dated august\u00a022, 2006 expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.  /s/\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0deloitte & touche llp

enjoyed by a single market dominant competitor. advances in computing and communications technologies have made this model viable and enabled the rapid growth of some of our competitors. we are devoting significant resources toward developing our own competing software plus services strategies including the windows azure platform, our hosted computing platform designed to facilitate the rapid, flexible and scalable development of cloud-based services. it is uncertain whether these strategies will be successful.  an important element of our business model has been to create platform-based ecosystems on which many participants can build diverse solutions. a competing vertically-integrated model, in which a single firm controls both the software and hardware elements of a product, has been successful with certain consumer products such as personal computers, mobile phones, and digital music players. we also offer vertically-integrated hardware and software products; however, efforts to compete with the vertically integrated model may increase our cost of sales and reduce our operating margins.  we face intense competition.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0we continue to experience intense competition across all markets for our products and services. our competitors range in size from fortune 100 companies to small, specialized single-product businesses and open source community-based projects. although we believe the breadth of our businesses and product portfolio is a competitive advantage, our competitors that are focused on narrower product lines may be more effective in devoting technical, marketing, and financial resources to compete with us. in addition, barriers to entry in our businesses generally are low and products, once developed, can be distributed broadly and quickly at relatively low cost. open source software vendors are devoting considerable efforts to developing software that mimics the features and functionality of our products, in some cases on the basis of technical specifications for microsoft technologies that we make available at little or no cost. in response to competition, we are developing versions of our products with basic functionality that are sold at lower prices than the standard versions. these competitive pressures may result in decreased sales volumes, price reductions, and/or increased operating costs, such as for marketing and sales incentives, resulting in lower revenue, gross margins, and operating income.  we may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property rights.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0protecting our global intellectual property rights and combating unlicensed copying and use of software and other intellectual property is difficult. while piracy adversely affects u.s. revenue, the impact on revenue from outside the u.s. is more significant, particularly in countries where laws are less protective of intellectual property rights. similarly, the absence of harmonized patent laws makes it more difficult to ensure consistent respect for patent rights. throughout the world, we actively educate consumers about the benefits of licensing genuine products and obtaining indemnification benefits for intellectual property risks, and we educate lawmakers about the advantages of a business climate where intellectual property rights are protected. however, continued educational and enforcement efforts may fail to enhance revenue. reductions in the legal protection for software intellectual property rights could adversely affect revenue.  third parties may claim we infringe their intellectual property rights.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0from time to time we receive notices from others claiming we infringe their intellectual property rights. the number of these claims may grow. to resolve these claims we may enter into royalty and licensing agreements on less favorable terms, stop selling or redesign affected products, or pay damages to satisfy indemnification commitments with our customers. such agreements may cause operating margins to decline. we have made and expect to continue making significant expenditures to settle claims related to the use of technology and intellectual property rights as part of our strategy to manage this risk.  we may not be able to protect our source code from copying if there is an unauthorized disclosure of source code.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0source code, the detailed program commands for our operating systems and other software programs, is critical to our business. although we license portions of our application and operating system source code to a number of licensees, we take significant measures to protect the secrecy of large portions of our source code. if an unauthorized disclosure of a significant portion of our source code occurs, we could potentially lose future trade secret protection for that source code. this could make it easier for third parties to compete with our products by copying functionality, which could adversely affect our revenue and operating margins. unauthorized disclosure of source code also could increase the security risks described in the next paragraph.   security vulnerabilities in our products could lead to reduced revenues or to liability claims.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0maintaining the security of computers and computer networks is a critical issue for us and our customers. hackers develop and deploy viruses, worms, and other malicious software programs that attack our products. although this is an industry-wide problem that affects computers across all platforms, it affects our products in particular because hackers tend   \u00a0 \u00a0  table of contents  \u00a0part i\u00a0  item 1a  \u00a0 \u00a0  to focus their efforts on the most popular operating systems and programs and we expect them to continue to do so. we devote significant resources to address security vulnerabilities through:  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 the cost of these steps could reduce our operating margins. despite these efforts, actual or perceived security vulnerabilities in our products could lead some customers to seek to return products, to reduce or delay future purchases, or to use competing products. customers may also increase their expenditures on protecting their existing computer systems from attack, which could delay adoption of new technologies. any of these actions by customers could adversely affect our revenue. in addition, actual or perceived vulnerabilities may lead to claims against us. although our license agreements typically contain provisions that eliminate or limit our exposure to such liability, there is no assurance these provisions will withstand all legal challenges.  we are subject to government litigation and regulatory activity that affects how we design and market our products.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0as a leading global software maker, we receive close scrutiny from government agencies under u.s. and foreign competition laws. some jurisdictions also provide private rights of action for competitors or consumers to assert claims of anti-competitive conduct. for example, we have been involved in the following actions.  lawsuits brought by the u.s. department of justice, 18 states, and the district of columbia in two separate actions were resolved through a consent decree that took effect in 2001 and a final judgment entered in 2002. these proceedings imposed various constraints on our windows operating system businesses. these constraints include limits on certain contracting practices, mandated disclosure of certain software program interfaces and protocols, and rights for computer manufacturers to limit the visibility of certain windows features in new pcs. we believe we are in full compliance with these rules. however, if we fail to comply with them, additional restrictions could be imposed on us that would adversely affect our business.  the european commission closely scrutinizes the design of high-volume microsoft products and the terms on which we make certain technologies used in these products, such as file formats, programming interfaces, and protocols, available to other companies. in 2004, the commission ordered us to create new versions of windows that do not include certain multimedia technologies and to provide our competitors with specifications for how to implement certain proprietary windows communications protocols in their own products. the commission\u0092s impact on product design may limit our ability to innovate in windows or other products in the future, diminish the developer appeal of the windows platform, and increase our product development costs. the availability of licenses related to protocols and file formats may enable competitors to develop software products that better mimic the functionality of our own products which could result in decreased sales of our\u00a0products.  government regulatory actions and court decisions such as these may hinder our ability to provide the benefits of our software to consumers and businesses, thereby reducing the attractiveness of our products and the revenues that come from them. new actions could be initiated at any time, either by these or other governments or private claimants, including with respect to new versions of windows or other microsoft products. the outcome of such actions, or steps taken to avoid them, could adversely affect us in a variety of ways, including:  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0    table of contents  \u00a0part i\u00a0  item 1a  \u00a0 \u00a0 our software and services online offerings are subject to government regulation of the internet domestically and internationally in many areas, including user privacy, telecommunications, data protection, and online content. the application of these laws and regulations to our business is often unclear and sometimes may conflict. compliance with these regulations may involve significant costs or require changes in business practices that result in reduced revenue. noncompliance could result in penalties being imposed on us or orders that we stop doing the alleged noncompliant activity.  our business depends on our ability to attract and retain talented employees.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0our business is based on successfully attracting and retaining talented employees. the market for highly skilled workers and leaders in our industry is extremely competitive. we are limited in our ability to recruit internationally by restrictive domestic immigration laws. if we are less successful in our recruiting efforts, or if we are unable to retain key employees, our ability to develop and deliver successful products and services may be adversely affected. effective succession planning is also important to our long-term success. failure to ensure effective transfer of knowledge and smooth transitions involving key employees could hinder our strategic planning and execution.  delays in product development schedules may adversely affect our revenues.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0the development of software products is a complex and time-consuming process. new products and enhancements to existing products can require long development and testing periods. our increasing focus on software plus services also presents new and complex development issues. significant delays in new product or service releases or significant problems in creating new products or services could adversely affect our revenue.  we make significant investments in new products and services that may not be profitable.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0our growth depends on our ability to innovate by offering new, and adding value to our existing, software and service offerings. we will continue to make significant investments in research, development, and marketing for new products, services, and technologies, including the windows pc operating system, the microsoft office system, xbox 360, live search, windows server, zune, windows live, the windows azure services platform, and other software plus services offerings. investments in new technology are speculative. commercial success depends on many factors, including innovativeness, developer support, and effective distribution and marketing. if customers do not perceive our latest offerings as providing significant new functionality or other value, they may reduce their purchases of new software products or upgrades, unfavorably impacting revenue. we may not achieve significant revenue from new product and service investments for a number of years, if at all. moreover, new products and services may not be profitable, and even if they are profitable, operating margins for new products and businesses may not be as high as the margins we have experienced historically.  adverse economic conditions may harm our business.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0unfavorable changes in economic conditions, including inflation, recession, or other changes in economic conditions, may result in lower information technology spending and adversely affect our revenue. if demand for pcs, servers, and other computing devices declines, or consumer or business spending for those products declines, our revenue will be adversely affected.\u00a0our product distribution system also relies on an extensive partner network. the impact of economic conditions on our partners, such as the bankruptcy of a major distributor, could result in sales channel disruption. challenging economic conditions also may impair the ability of our customers to pay for products and services they have purchased. as a result, reserves for doubtful accounts and write-offs of accounts receivable may increase. we maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings, types, and maturities. these investments are subject to general credit, liquidity, market, and interest rate risks, which may be exacerbated by unusual events that have affected global financial markets. if global credit and equity markets experience prolonged periods of decline, our investment portfolio may be adversely impacted and we could determine that more of our investments have experienced an other-than-temporary decline in fair value, requiring impairment charges that could adversely impact our financial results.  we have claims and lawsuits against us that may result in adverse outcomes.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0we are subject to a variety of claims and lawsuits. adverse outcomes in some or all of these claims may result in significant monetary damages or injunctive relief that could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business. although management currently believes resolving all of these matters, individually or in the aggregate, will not have a material adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows, the litigation and other claims are subject to inherent uncertainties and management\u0092s view of these matters may change in the future. a material adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows also could occur for the period in which the effect of an unfavorable final outcome becomes probable and reasonably estimable.  \u00a0 \u00a0  table of contents  \u00a0part i\u00a0  item 1a  \u00a0 \u00a0 we may have additional tax liabilities.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0we are subject to income taxes in the united states and many foreign jurisdictions. significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes. in the ordinary course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. we regularly are under audit by tax authorities. although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals. the results of an audit or litigation could have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows in the period or periods for which that determination is made. in addition, there have been proposals to reform u.s. tax laws that would significantly impact how u.s. multinational corporations are taxed on foreign earnings.\u00a0we earn a substantial portion of our income in foreign countries. although we cannot predict whether or in what form this proposed legislation will pass, if enacted it could have a material adverse impact on our tax expense and cash flow.  our vertically-integrated hardware and software products may experience quality or supply problems.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0our hardware products such as the xbox 360 console are highly complex and can have defects in design, manufacture, or associated software. we could incur significant expenses, lost revenue, and reputational harm if we fail to detect or effectively address such issues through design, testing, or warranty repairs. we obtain some components of our hardware devices from sole suppliers. if a component delivery from a sole-source supplier is delayed or becomes unavailable or industry shortages occur, we may be unable to obtain timely replacement supplies, resulting in reduced sales. either component shortages or excess or obsolete inventory may require us to record charges to cost of revenue. xbox 360 consoles are assembled in asia; disruptions in the supply chain may result in console shortages that would affect our revenues and operating margins. these same risks would apply to any other vertically-integrated hardware and software products we may offer.  if our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets become impaired we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0under generally accepted accounting principles, we review our amortizable intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually. factors that may be considered a change in circumstances, indicating that the carrying value of our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets may not be recoverable, include a decline in stock price and market capitalization, reduced future cash flow estimates, and slower growth rates in our industry. we may be required to record a significant charge in our financial statements during the period in which any impairment of our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets is determined, negatively impacting our results of operations.  we operate a global business that exposes us to additional risks.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0we operate in over 100 countries and a significant part of our revenue comes from international sales. pressure to make our pricing structure uniform might require that we reduce the sales price of our software in the united states and other countries. operations outside the united states may be affected by changes in trade protection laws, policies and measures, and other regulatory requirements affecting trade and investment, including the foreign corrupt practices act and local laws prohibiting corrupt payments; and changes in regulatory requirements for software. emerging markets are a significant focus of our international growth strategy. the developing nature of these markets presents a number of risks. deterioration of social, political, labor, or economic conditions in a specific country or region and difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations may also adversely affect our operations or financial results. although we hedge a portion of our international currency exposure, significant fluctuations in exchange rates between the u.s. dollar and foreign currencies may adversely affect our net revenues.  catastrophic events or geo-political conditions may disrupt our business.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0a disruption or failure of our systems or operations in the event of a major earthquake, weather event, cyber-attack, terrorist attack, or other catastrophic event could cause delays in completing sales, providing services, or performing other mission-critical functions. our corporate headquarters, a significant portion of our research and development activities, and certain other critical business operations are located in the seattle, washington area, and we have other business operations in the silicon valley area of california, both of which are near major earthquake faults. a catastrophic event that results in the destruction or disruption of any of our critical business or information technology systems could harm our ability to conduct normal business operations and our operating results. abrupt political change, terrorist activity, and armed conflict pose a risk of general economic disruption in affected countries, which may increase our operating costs. these conditions also may add uncertainty to the timing and budget for technology investment decisions by our customers.  \u00a0  \u00a0    table of contents  \u00a0part ii\u00a0  item 7  \u00a0 \u00a0  and other areas that we believe may contribute to our long-term growth. we also invest in research and development of advanced technologies for future software products. we believe that delivering innovative and high-value solutions through our integrated platform is the key to meeting customer needs and to our future growth.  this long-term focus on investment in research and development has enabled us to lay a foundation for future growth by delivering innovative products, creating opportunities for partners, and improving customer satisfaction. our focus in fiscal year 2010 is to build on this foundation and to continue to execute well in key areas through ongoing innovation on our integrated software platform, by responding effectively to customer and partner needs, and by focusing internally on product excellence, business efficacy, and accountability across the company.  summary of results for fiscal years 2009, 2008, and 2007  \u00a0 fiscal year 2009 compared with fiscal year 2008  revenue declined across most segments primarily driven by weakness in the global pc market and the unfavorable economic environment. foreign currency exchange rates accounted for a $486 million or one percentage point increase in revenue. primary factors contributing to the decline include the following:  \u00a0 \u00a0 the above declines were partially offset by increased server and server application revenue, reflecting recognition of deferred revenue from previously signed agreements and continued adoption of the windows server platform and applications through sql server, enterprise cal suites, and system center products.  operating income decreased primarily reflecting decreased revenue. operating expenses were flat with decreased general and administrative and sales and marketing expenses offset by increased headcount-related expenses, cost of revenue, and employee severance charges.  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 in january 2009, we announced and implemented a resource management program to reduce discretionary operating expenses, employee headcount, and capital expenditures. as part of this program, we announced the   \u00a0 \u00a0  table of contents  \u00a0part ii\u00a0  item 7  \u00a0 \u00a0  elimination of up to 5,000 positions in research and development, marketing, sales, finance, legal, human resources, and information technology by june\u00a030, 2010. during the twelve months ended june\u00a030, 2009, we recorded employee severance charges of $330 million for the expected reduction in employee headcount.  diluted earnings per share declined primarily reflecting decreased net income, partially offset by share repurchases during the past 12 months. we repurchased 318\u00a0million shares during the twelve months ended june\u00a030, 2009.  fiscal year 2008 compared with fiscal year 2007  revenue growth was driven primarily by increased licensing of the 2007 microsoft office system, increased xbox 360 platform sales, increased revenue associated with windows server and sql server, and increased licensing of windows vista. foreign currency exchange rates accounted for a $1.6 billion or three percentage point increase in revenue during fiscal year 2008.  operating income increased primarily reflecting increased revenue, partially offset by increased headcount-related expenses, increased costs for legal settlements and legal contingencies, and increased cost of revenue. headcount-related expenses increased 12%, reflecting an increase in headcount during fiscal year 2008. we incurred $1.8 billion of legal charges during fiscal year 2008 primarily related to the european commission fine of $1.4 billion (\u0080899 million) as compared with $511 million of legal charges during fiscal year 2007. cost of revenue increased $905 million or 8%, reflecting increased data center and equipment costs, online content expenses, and increased costs associated with the growth in our consulting services, partially offset by decreased xbox 360 costs. the decreased xbox 360 costs reflect the $1.1 billion charge in fiscal year 2007 related to the expansion of our xbox 360 warranty, partially offset by increased xbox 360 product costs reflecting growth in unit console sales.  the diluted earnings per share growth was impacted by the $1.1 billion xbox 360 charge in fiscal year 2007 and share repurchases during fiscal year 2008.  fiscal year 2010 outlook  global macroeconomic factors have a strong correlation to demand for our software, services, hardware, and online offerings. while we see the potential for improvement in calendar year 2010, we are unable to predict the actual timing. in the meantime, we are positive about our relative market position and our product delivery plans. in addition, we remain focused on executing in the areas we can control by continuing to provide high value products at the lowest total cost of ownership while managing our expenses.  segment product revenue/operating income (loss)  the revenue and operating income (loss) amounts in this section are presented on a basis consistent with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states (\u0093u.s. gaap\u0094) and include certain reconciling items attributable to each of the segments. segment information appearing in note 22 \u0096 segment information and geographic data of the notes to financial statements (part ii, item\u00a08) is presented on a basis consistent with our current internal management reporting, in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards (\u0093sfas\u0094) no.\u00a0131, disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information. certain corporate-level activity has been excluded from segment operating results and is analyzed separately. prior period amounts have been recast to conform to the way we internally managed and monitored performance at the segment level during the current period.  client  \u00a0 client offerings consist of premium and standard edition windows operating systems. premium editions are those that include additional functionality and are sold at a price above our standard editions. premium editions include windows vista business, windows vista home premium, windows vista ultimate, windows vista enterprise,   \u00a0 \u00a0    table of contents  \u00a0part ii\u00a0  item 7  \u00a0 \u00a0  windows xp professional, windows xp media center, and windows xp tablet pc. standard editions include windows vista home basic and windows xp home. client revenue growth is directly impacted by growth of pc purchases from original equipment manufacturers (\u0093oems\u0094) that pre-install versions of windows operating systems because the oem channel accounts for over 80% of total client revenue. the differences between unit growth rates and revenue growth rates from year to year are affected primarily by changes in the mix of oem windows premium edition operating systems licensed as a percentage of total oem windows operating systems licensed (\u0093oem premium mix\u0094). additional differences in growth rates result from the impact from lower cost netbook pcs, which are sold with a lower cost version of windows, changes in geographic mix, and changes in the channel mix of products sold by large, multi-national oems versus those sold by local and regional system builders.  fiscal year 2009 compared with fiscal year 2008  client revenue decreased primarily as a result of pc market weakness, especially pcs sold to businesses. oem revenue decreased $2.3 billion or 16% while oem license units declined 2%. the decline in oem revenue reflects a 10 percentage point decline in the oem premium mix to 64%. based on our estimates, total worldwide pc shipments from all sources experienced a decline of approximately 1% to growth of approximately 2%, driven by changes in demand in emerging and developed markets.  client operating income decreased primarily reflecting decreased revenue and increased sales and marketing expenses. sales and marketing expenses increased $122 million or 7%, primarily reflecting increased advertising and marketing.  fiscal year 2008 compared with fiscal year 2007  client revenue increased reflecting growth in licensing of windows vista. by the end of fiscal year 2008, more than 180\u00a0million windows vista licenses had been sold (approximately 130\u00a0million were sold during fiscal year 2008) and millions of enterprise seats had been deployed. oem revenue increased $1.8 billion or 14%, driven by 16% growth in oem license units. revenue from commercial and retail licensing of windows operating systems increased $202 million or 9%, primarily from enterprise agreements and anti-piracy efforts in emerging markets. during fiscal year 2008, the oem premium mix increased seven percentage points to 74%, reflecting strong demand for windows vista home premium. we estimate total worldwide pc shipments from all sources grew approximately 12% to 14%, driven by demand in both emerging and mature markets.  client operating income increased reflecting increased revenue, partially offset by increased sales and marketing expenses and cost of revenue. sales and marketing expenses increased $106 million or 7%, primarily reflecting increased expenses associated with our corporate sales force. cost of revenue increased $116 million or 14%, primarily driven by windows vista product costs.  other  the segment information discussed above is presented the way we internally managed and monitored performance at the business group level in fiscal years 2009, 2008, and 2007. effective july 1, 2009, we reorganized the windows live operations from online services business to client to better align our strategies and focus in those areas.  server and tools  \u00a0 server and tools licenses products, applications, tools, content, and services that are designed to make information technology professionals and developers more productive and efficient. server and tools offerings consist of server software licenses and client access licenses (\u0093cal\u0094) for windows server, microsoft sql server, and other server products. we also offer developer tools, training, certification, microsoft press, premier product support services, and microsoft consulting services. server products can be run on-site, in a partner-hosted environment, or in a microsoft-   \u00a0 \u00a0  table of contents  \u00a0part ii\u00a0  item 7  \u00a0 \u00a0  hosted environment. we use multiple channels for licensing, including pre-installed oem versions, licenses through partners, and licenses directly to end customers. we sell licenses both as one-time licenses and as multi-year volume licenses.  fiscal year 2009 compared with fiscal year 2008  server and tools revenue increased reflecting growth in both product and services revenue. server and server application revenue (including cal) and developer tools revenue increased $809 million or 8%, primarily driven by growth in sql server, enterprise cal suites, and system center revenue. this growth reflects recognition of deferred revenue from previously signed agreements and continued adoption of the windows server platform and applications. consulting and premier product support services revenue increased $215 million or 8%, primarily due to revenue from annuity support agreements. foreign currency exchange rates accounted for a $140 million or one percentage point increase in revenue.  server and tools operating income increased primarily due to growth in product revenue, partially offset by increased research and development expenses and cost of revenue. research and development expenses increased $168 million or 9%, primarily driven by increased headcount-related expenses. cost of revenue increased $84 million or 3%, reflecting the growth in support, online, and consulting services.  fiscal year 2008 compared with fiscal year 2007  server and tools revenue increased reflecting growth in product and services revenue and included a favorable impact from foreign currency exchange rates of $464 million or four percentage points. server and server application revenue (including cal revenue) and developer tools revenue increased $1.4 billion or 16%, primarily driven by growth in volume licensing of windows server and sql server products. this growth reflects broad adoption of the windows platform and applications with the releases of windows server 2008 and visual studio 2008 during fiscal year 2008. consulting and premier product support services revenue increased $593 million or 29%, primarily due to higher demand for consulting and support services by corporate enterprises.  server and tools operating income increased primarily due to growth in product revenue, partially offset by increased sales and marketing expenses, cost of revenue, and research and development expenses. sales and marketing expenses increased $458 million or 13%, due to higher expenses associated with our corporate sales force. cost of revenue increased $404 million or 19%, reflecting the growth in consulting and premier product support services. research and development expenses increased $177 million or 10%, primarily driven by increased headcount-related expenses. headcount-related expenses increased 6%, driven by an increase in headcount from the prior year-end.  online services business  \u00a0 online services business (\u0093osb\u0094) consists of an online advertising platform with offerings for both publishers and advertisers, personal communications services, such as email and instant messaging, online information offerings, such as bing, and the msn portals and channels around the world. we earn revenue primarily from online advertising, including search, display, email, messaging services, and advertiser and publisher tools. revenue is also generated through subscriptions and transactions generated from online paid services digital marketing and advertising agency services, and from msn narrowband internet access subscribers (\u0093access\u0094). during the first quarter of fiscal year 2008, we completed our acquisition of aquantive, inc.

(\u0093yahoo\u0094). under terms of the agreement, microsoft will provide the exclusive algorithmic and paid search platform for yahoo websites. we believe this agreement will allow us over time to improve the effectiveness and increase the value of our search offering through greater scale in search queries and an expanded and more competitive search and advertising marketplace. the transaction is subject to regulatory review. both parties anticipate entering into more detailed definitive agreements prior to closing the transaction which is expected in calendar year 2010. see note 24 \u0096

to the european commission fine of $1.4 billion (\u0080899 million). sales and marketing expenses decreased $412 million or 30%, reflecting the resource management program implemented in january 2009.  fiscal year 2008 compared with fiscal year 2007  corporate-level expenses increased, reflecting increased costs for legal settlements and legal contingencies and a 13% increase in headcount-related expenses. we incurred $1.8 billion of legal charges during fiscal year 2008 primarily related to the european commission fine of $1.4 billion (\u0080899 million) as compared with $511 million of legal charges during fiscal year 2007. the increase in headcount-related expenses reflects an increase in headcount from the prior year-end.  operating expenses   cost of revenue  \u00a0 cost of revenue includes manufacturing and distribution costs for products sold and programs licensed, operating costs related to product support service centers and product distribution centers, costs incurred to drive traffic to our website and/or acquire online advertising space (\u0093traffic acquisition costs\u0094), costs incurred to support and maintain internet-based products and services, warranty costs, inventory valuation adjustments, costs associated with the delivery of consulting services, and the amortization of capitalized research and development costs associated with software products that have reached technological feasibility.  fiscal year 2009 compared with fiscal year 2008  cost of revenue increased during the twelve months ended june\u00a030, 2009, primarily reflecting increased online costs, including traffic acquisition, data center and equipment, and headcount costs, partially offset by decreased xbox 360 platform costs.  fiscal year 2008 compared with fiscal year 2007  cost of revenue increased reflecting increased data center and equipment costs, online content expenses, and increased costs associated with the growth in our consulting services, partially offset by decreased xbox 360 costs. xbox 360 costs decreased because of the $1.1 billion charge in fiscal year 2007 (which primarily related to the expansion of our xbox 360 warranty coverage), partially offset by increased xbox 360 product costs, reflecting growth in unit console sales.  research and development  \u00a0 research and development expenses include payroll, employee benefits, stock-based compensation expense, and other headcount-related expenses associated with product development. research and development expenses also include third-party development and programming costs, localization costs incurred to translate software for international markets, the amortization of purchased software code and services content, and in-process research and development.  \u00a0 \u00a0    table of contents  \u00a0part ii\u00a0  item 7  \u00a0 \u00a0 fiscal year 2009 compared with fiscal year 2008  research and development expenses increased during the twelve months ended june\u00a030, 2009, primarily reflecting a 13% increase in headcount-related costs.  fiscal year 2008 compared with fiscal year 2007  research and development expenses increased reflecting increased headcount-related expenses, increased product development costs, and in-process research and development expenses related to acquisitions during fiscal year 2008. headcount-related expenses increased 12%, reflecting an increase in headcount from the prior year-end.  sales and marketing  \u00a0 sales and marketing expenses include payroll, employee benefits, stock-based compensation expense, and other headcount-related expenses associated with sales and marketing personnel and advertising, promotions, trade shows, seminars, and other programs.  effective july\u00a01, 2008, we began presenting gains and losses resulting from foreign currency remeasurements as a component of other income (expense). prior to july\u00a01, 2008, we included gains and losses resulting from foreign currency remeasurements as a component of sales and marketing expense.\u00a0we changed our presentation because this better reflects how we manage these foreign currency exposures, as such gains and losses arising from the remeasurement of foreign currency transactions are incidental to our operations. for the twelve months ended june\u00a030, 2009, $509 million of losses were reported as other income (expense). for the twelve months ended june\u00a030, 2008 and 2007, $221 million and $86 million of gains, respectively, were previously recorded as a component of sales and marketing expense and have been recast as other income (expense).  fiscal year 2009 compared with fiscal year 2008  sales and marketing expenses decreased, primarily driven by the resource management program implemented in january 2009.  fiscal year 2008 compared with fiscal year 2007  sales and marketing expenses increased, primarily reflecting increased headcount-related expenses and increased corporate marketing and advertising campaigns. headcount-related expenses increased 14%, driven by an increase in headcount from the prior year-end.  general and administrative  \u00a0 general and administrative costs include payroll, employee benefits, stock-based compensation expense and other headcount-related expenses associated with finance, legal, facilities, certain human resources and other administrative headcount, and legal and other administrative fees.  \u00a0 \u00a0  table of contents  \u00a0part ii\u00a0  item 7  \u00a0 \u00a0 fiscal year 2009 compared with fiscal year 2008  general and administrative expenses decreased primarily reflecting decreased costs for legal settlements and legal contingencies. we incurred legal charges of $283 million in current year, as compared with $1.8 billion during fiscal year 2008. the fiscal year 2008 legal costs were primarily related to the european commission fine of $1.4 billion (\u0080899 million).  fiscal year 2008 compared with fiscal year 2007  general and administrative expenses increased reflecting increased costs for legal settlements and legal contingencies, increased consulting and professional fees, and increased headcount-related expenses. we incurred $1.8 billion of legal charges during fiscal year 2008, primarily related to the european commission fine, as compared with $511 million of legal charges during fiscal year 2007. headcount-related expenses increased 7%, reflecting an increase in headcount from the prior year-end.  employee severance  in january 2009, we announced and implemented a resource management program to reduce discretionary operating expenses, employee headcount, and capital expenditures. as part of this program, we announced the elimination of up to 5,000 positions in research and development, marketing, sales, finance, legal, human resources, and information technology by june\u00a030, 2010. during the current year, we recorded employee severance charges of $330 million for the expected reduction in employee headcount.  other income (expense)  the components of other income (expense) were as follows:  \u00a0 effective july\u00a01, 2008, we began presenting gains and losses resulting from foreign currency remeasurements as a component of other income (expense). prior to july\u00a01, 2008, we included gains and losses resulting from foreign currency remeasurements as a component of sales and marketing expense.\u00a0we changed our presentation because this better reflects how we manage these foreign currency exposures, as such gains and losses arising from the remeasurement of foreign currency transactions are incidental to our operations. for the twelve months ended june\u00a030, 2009, $509 million of losses were reported as other income (expense). for the twelve months ended june\u00a030, 2008 and 2007, $221 million and $86 million of gains, respectively, were previously recorded as a component of sales and marketing expense and have been recast as other income (expense).  investments are considered to be impaired when a decline in fair value is judged to be other-than-temporary. we employ a systematic methodology that considers available evidence in evaluating potential impairment of our investments, including market declines subsequent to the period end. if the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value, among other factors, we evaluate general market conditions, credit quality of debt instrument issuers, the duration and extent to which the fair value is less than cost, and for equity securities, our intent and ability to hold, or plans to sell, the investment. for fixed income securities, we also evaluate whether we have plans to sell the security or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery. we also consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of and business outlook for the investee, including industry and   \u00a0 \u00a0    table of contents  \u00a0part ii\u00a0  item 7  \u00a0 \u00a0  sector performance, changes in technology, and operational and financing cash flow factors. once a decline in fair value is determined to be other-than-temporary, an impairment charge is recorded to other income (expense) and a new cost basis in the investment is established.  we lend certain fixed-income and equity securities to increase investment returns. the loaned securities continue to be carried as investments on our balance sheet. collateral and/or security interest is determined based upon the underlying security and the creditworthiness of the borrower. cash collateral is recorded as an asset with a corresponding liability.  we use derivative instruments to manage risks related to foreign currencies, equity prices, interest rates, and credit; to enhance investment returns; and to facilitate portfolio diversification. gains and losses from changes in fair values of derivatives that are not designated as hedges are recognized in other income (expense). these are generally offset by unrealized gains and losses in the underlying securities in the investment portfolio and are recorded as a component of other comprehensive income.  fiscal year 2009 compared with fiscal year 2008  dividends and interest income decreased primarily reflecting lower interest rates on our fixed-income investments. net recognized losses on investments increased primarily due to higher other-than-temporary impairments that were partially offset by gains on sales of certain equity investments held in our strategic investments portfolio. other-than-temporary impairments were $862 million during the twelve months ended june\u00a030, 2009, as compared with $312 million during the twelve months ended june\u00a030, 2008 and increased primarily due to declines in equity values as a result of deterioration in equity markets. net losses on derivatives increased primarily due to losses on equity, commodity, and interest rate derivatives in the current period as compared with gains in the prior period. net losses on foreign currency remeasurements increased due to the strengthening of the u.s. dollar, particularly in the first half of the current fiscal year.  fiscal year 2008 compared with fiscal year 2007  dividends and interest income decreased reflecting lower interest rates on our fixed-income investments and a reduction in the average balance of interest-bearing investments owned. net recognized gains on investments, which include other-than-temporary impairments of $312 million during fiscal year 2008 and $25 million during fiscal year 2007, decreased primarily due to declines in equity values as a result of the recent stock market decline. net gains on derivatives increased primarily due to higher net gains on equity, commodity, and interest rate derivatives.  income taxes  fiscal year 2009 compared with fiscal year 2008  our effective tax rates in fiscal years 2009 and 2008 were 27% and 26%, respectively. while the fiscal year 2009 rate reflects a higher mix of foreign earnings taxed at lower rates, the rate increased from the prior year because the fiscal year 2008 rate reflects the resolution of tax positions relating to our agreement with the internal revenue service (\u0093irs\u0094) settling the 2000-2003 examination, partially offset by the european commission fine which was not tax deductible. as a result of the settlement and the impact on subsequent years, we paid the irs approximately $4.1 billion during fiscal year 2009.  fiscal year 2008 compared with fiscal year 2007  our effective tax rates in fiscal year 2008 and 2007 were 26% and 30%, respectively. the fiscal year 2008 rate was lower due to the items noted above.  financial condition  cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments totaled $31.4 billion as of june\u00a030, 2009, compared with $23.7 billion as of june\u00a030, 2008. equity and other investments were $4.9 billion as of june\u00a030, 2009, compared with $6.6 billion as of june\u00a030, 2008. our investments consist primarily of fixed-income securities, diversified among industries and individual issuers. our investments are generally liquid and investment grade. the portfolio is invested predominantly in u.s. dollar-denominated securities, but also includes foreign-denominated securities in order to diversify risk. we invest primarily in short-term securities to facilitate liquidity and for capital preservation. as a result of the special dividend paid in the second quarter of fiscal year 2005 and shares repurchased, our retained deficit, including accumulated other comprehensive income, was $22.8 billion at june\u00a030, 2009. our retained deficit is not expected to affect our future ability to operate, pay dividends, or repay our debt given our continuing profitability and strong cash and financial position.  \u00a0 \u00a0  table of contents  \u00a0part ii\u00a0  item 7  \u00a0 \u00a0 in general, and where applicable, we use quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities to determine fair value.\u00a0this pricing methodology applies to our level 1 investments, such as exchange-traded mutual funds, domestic and international equities, u.s. treasuries, and agency securities.\u00a0if quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities are not available to determine fair value, then we use quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities or inputs other than the quoted prices that are observable either directly or indirectly. this pricing methodology applies to our level 2 investments such as corporate notes and bonds, foreign government bonds, mortgage-backed securities, and certain agency securities.\u00a0level 3 investments are valued using internally developed models with unobservable inputs.\u00a0assets and liabilities measured using unobservable inputs are an immaterial portion of our portfolio.  a majority of our investments are priced by pricing vendors and are generally level 1 or level 2 investments as these vendors either provide a quoted market price in an active market or use observable inputs for their pricing without applying significant adjustments.\u00a0broker pricing is used mainly when a quoted price is not available, the investment is not priced by our pricing vendors, or when a broker price is more reflective of fair values in the market in which the investment trades. our broker-priced investments are generally labeled as level 2 investments because the broker prices these investments based on similar assets without applying significant adjustments.\u00a0in addition, all of our broker-priced investments have a sufficient level of trading volume to demonstrate that the fair values used are appropriate for these investments. our fair value processes include controls that are designed to ensure appropriate fair values are recorded.\u00a0such controls include model validation, review of key model inputs, analysis of period-over-period fluctuations, and independent recalculation of prices where appropriate.  while we own certain mortgage- and asset-backed fixed-income securities, our portfolio as of june\u00a030, 2009 does not contain direct exposure to subprime mortgages or structured vehicles that derive their value from subprime collateral. the majority of the mortgage-backed securities are collateralized by prime residential mortgages and carry a 100% principal and interest guarantee, primarily from federal national mortgage association, federal home loan mortgage corporation, and government national mortgage association. debt  short-term debt  in september 2008, our board of directors authorized debt financings of up to $6.0 billion. pursuant to the authorization, we established a commercial paper program providing for the issuance and sale of up to $2.0 billion in short-term commercial paper. as of june\u00a030, 2009, $2.0 billion of the commercial paper was issued and outstanding with a weighted average interest rate, including issuance costs, of 0.20% and maturities of 22 to 119 days.  in september 2008, we also entered into a $2.0 billion six-month senior unsecured credit facility, principally to support the commercial paper program. in november 2008, we replaced the six-month credit facility with a $2.0 billion 364-day credit facility. this credit facility expires on november\u00a06, 2009. in march 2009, we entered into an additional credit facility. this $1.0 billion 364-day credit facility expires on march\u00a012, 2010. as of june\u00a030, 2009, we were in compliance with the only financial covenant in both credit agreements, which requires us to maintain a coverage ratio of at least three times earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization to interest expense.\u00a0no amounts were drawn against these credit facilities during the year ended june\u00a030, 2009.  long-term debt  in november 2008, we filed a shelf registration statement with the u.s. securities and exchange commission that allows us to issue debt securities from time to time pursuant to the september 2008 authorization for debt financings of up to $6.0 billion. in may 2009, we issued $3.75 billion of debt securities under that registration statement as follows: $2.0 billion aggregate principal amount of 2.95% notes due 2014, $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of 4.20% notes due 2019, and $750 million aggregate principal amount of 5.20% notes due 2039 (collectively \u0093the notes\u0094). interest on the notes will be payable semi-annually on june\u00a01 and december\u00a01 of each year, commencing on december\u00a01, 2009, to holders of record on the preceding may\u00a015 and november\u00a015.\u00a0the notes are senior unsecured obligations and will rank equally with our other unsecured and unsubordinated debt outstanding.  we intend to use the net proceeds from sales of the debt securities for general corporate purposes, which may include funding for working capital, capital expenditures, repurchases of our capital stock, and acquisitions.  \u00a0 \u00a0    table of contents  \u00a0part ii\u00a0  item 7  \u00a0 \u00a0 unearned revenue  unearned revenue is comprised of the following items:  volume licensing programs  represents customer billings for multi-year licensing arrangements, paid either upfront or annually at the beginning of each billing coverage period, which are accounted for as subscriptions with revenue recognized ratably over the billing coverage period.  undelivered elements  represents the right to receive unspecified upgrades/enhancements of microsoft internet explorer on a when-and-if-available basis and free post-delivery telephone support. this revenue deferral is applicable for windows xp and prior versions shipped as retail packaged products, products licensed to oems, and perpetual licenses for current products under our open and select volume licensing programs. the amount recorded as unearned is based on the sales price of those elements when sold separately and is recognized ratably on a straight-line basis over the related product\u0092s life cycle. product life cycles are currently estimated at three and one-half years for windows operating systems. undelivered elements include $276 million of deferred revenue related to the windows 7 upgrade option program. the program, which started june\u00a026, 2009, allows customers who purchase pcs from participating computer makers or retailers with certain versions of windows vista to receive an upgrade to the corresponding version of windows 7 at minimal or no cost. in addition, purchasers of retail packaged windows vista may also qualify for a free or discounted upgrade to the equivalent windows 7 product with participating retailers in participating markets when the product becomes generally available.  other  represents payments for post-delivery support and consulting services to be performed in the future, online advertising for which the advertisement has yet to be displayed, microsoft dynamics business solutions products, xbox live subscriptions, mediaroom, and other offerings for which we have been paid upfront and earn the revenue when we provide the service or software, or otherwise meet the revenue recognition criteria.  the following table outlines the expected recognition of unearned revenue as of june\u00a030, 2009:  \u00a0 cash flows  fiscal year 2009 compared with fiscal year 2008  cash flow from operations decreased $2.6 billion due to payment of approximately $4.1 billion to the irs in connection with our settlement of the 2000-2003 audit examination. this impact was partially offset by the fiscal year 2008 payment of the $1.4 billion (\u0080899 million) european commission fine. cash used for financing decreased $5.5 billion primarily due to $5.7 billion of net cash proceeds from issuance of short-term and long-term debt in fiscal   \u00a0 \u00a0  table of contents  \u00a0part ii\u00a0  item 7  \u00a0 \u00a0  year 2009. financing activities also included a $3.2 billion decrease in common stock repurchased, which was offset by a $2.9 billion decline in common stock issued. cash used for investing increased $11.2 billion due to a $15.9 billion rise in purchases of investments along with a $1.7 billion decrease in cash from investment sales and maturities. these impacts were partially offset by a $7.2 billion decrease in cash paid for acquisition of companies, including the purchase of aquantive in fiscal year 2008.  fiscal year 2008 compared with fiscal year 2007  cash flow from operations increased $3.8 billion due to an increase in cash received from customers driven by 18% revenue growth, partially offset by the $1.4 billion (\u0080899 million) payment of the european commission fine. cash used for financing decreased $11.6 billion primarily due to a $15.0 billion decrease in common stock repurchases, partially offset by a $3.3 billion decrease in cash proceeds from the issuance of common stock. cash used for investing was $4.6 billion for fiscal year 2008 as compared with cash provided of $6.1 billion for fiscal year 2007. this decrease was primarily due to a $6.9 billion increase in cash paid for acquisition of companies, reflecting the purchase of aquantive in the first quarter of fiscal year 2008, a $918 million increase in purchases of property and equipment, and a $3.1 billion decrease in cash from combined investment purchases, sales, and maturities.  stockholders\u0092 equity at june\u00a030, 2009, was $39.6 billion. we will continue to invest in sales, marketing, product support infrastructure, and existing and advanced areas of technology. additions to property and equipment will continue, including new facilities, data centers, and computer systems for research and development, sales and marketing, support, and administrative staff. commitments for constructing new buildings were $621 million on june\u00a030, 2009. we have operating leases for most u.s. and international sales and support offices and certain equipment under which we incurred rental expense totaling $475 million, $398 million, and $325 million, in fiscal years 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively. we have not engaged in any related party transactions or arrangements with unconsolidated entities or other persons that are reasonably likely to materially affect liquidity or the availability of capital resources.  share repurchases  on september\u00a022, 2008, we announced the completion of the two repurchase programs approved by our board of directors during the first quarter of fiscal year 2007 to buy back up to $40.0 billion of microsoft common stock. on september\u00a022, 2008, we also announced that our board of directors approved a new share repurchase program authorizing up to $40.0 billion in share repurchases with an expiration date of september\u00a030, 2013. we repurchased 318\u00a0million shares for $8.2 billion during the fiscal year ended june\u00a030, 2009; 101\u00a0million shares were repurchased for $2.7 billion under the repurchase program approved by our board of directors during the first quarter of fiscal year 2007 and 217\u00a0million shares were repurchased for $5.5 billion under the repurchase program approved by our board of directors during the first quarter of fiscal year 2009. as of june\u00a030, 2009, approximately $34.5 billion remained of the $40.0 billion approved repurchase amount. all repurchases were made using cash resources. the repurchase program may be suspended or discontinued at any time without notice.  dividends  during fiscal years 2009 and 2008, our board of directors declared the following dividends:  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0    table of contents  \u00a0part ii\u00a0  item 7  \u00a0 \u00a0 we believe existing cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments, together with funds generated from operations, should be sufficient to meet operating requirements, regular quarterly dividends, debt repayment schedules, and share repurchases. our philosophy regarding the maintenance of a balance sheet with a large component of cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, and equity and other investments, reflects our views on potential future capital requirements relating to research and development, creation and expansion of sales distribution channels, investments and acquisitions, share dilution management, legal risks, and challenges to our business model. we regularly assess our investment management approach in view of our current and potential future needs.  off-balance sheet arrangements  we provide indemnifications of varying scope and size to certain customers against claims of intellectual property infringement made by third parties arising from the use of our products and certain other matters. we evaluate estimated losses for these indemnifications under sfas no.\u00a05, accounting for contingencies, as interpreted by financial accounting standards board interpretation (\u0093fin\u0094) no.\u00a045, guarantor\u0092s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees, including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others. we consider such factors as the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss. to date, we have not encountered significant costs as a result of these obligations and have not accrued any liabilities related to these indemnifications in our financial statements.  contractual obligations  the following table summarizes our outstanding contractual obligations as of june\u00a030, 2009. we expect to fund these commitments with existing cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and cash flows from operations.  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  table of contents  \u00a0part ii\u00a0  item 7  \u00a0 \u00a0 recently issued accounting standards  recently adopted accounting pronouncements  on april\u00a01, 2009, we adopted the financial accounting standards board (\u0093fasb\u0094) staff positions (\u0093fsp\u0094) fas 157-4, fsp fas 115-2 and fas 124-2, and fsp fas 107-1 and apb 28-1. these fsps are intended to provide additional application guidance and enhance disclosures about fair value measurements and impairments of securities. fsp fas 157-4 clarifies the objective and method of fair value measurement even when there has been a significant decrease in market activity for the asset being measured. fsp fas 115-2 and fas 124-2 establishes a new model for measuring other-than-temporary impairments for debt securities, including establishing criteria for when to recognize a write-down through earnings versus other comprehensive income. fsp fas\u00a0107-1 and apb 28-1 expands the fair value disclosures required for all financial instruments within the scope of sfas no.\u00a0107, disclosures about fair value of financial instruments, to interim periods. adoption of these fsps did not have a significant impact on our accounting for financial instruments but did expand our associated disclosures.  on january\u00a01, 2009, we adopted sfas no.\u00a0161, disclosures about derivative instruments and hedging activities, an amendment of fasb statement no.\u00a0133. sfas no.\u00a0161 requires additional disclosures about the company\u0092s objectives in using derivative instruments and hedging activities, the method of accounting for such instruments under sfas no.\u00a0133, accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities, and its related interpretations, and tabular disclosures of the effects of such instruments and related hedged items on our financial position, financial performance, and cash flows. see note 5 \u0096 derivatives of the notes to financial statements (part ii, item\u00a08).  on july\u00a01, 2008, we adopted sfas no.\u00a0157, fair value measurements, for all financial assets and liabilities and nonfinancial assets and liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis (at least annually).\u00a0sfas no.\u00a0157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. this statement does not require any new fair value measurements, but provides guidance on how to measure fair value by providing a fair value hierarchy used to classify the source of the information. see note 4 \u0096 investments of the notes to financial statements (part ii, item\u00a08).  sfas no.\u00a0159, the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities-including an amendment of fasb statement no.\u00a0115, became effective for us on july\u00a01, 2008. sfas no.\u00a0159 gives us the irrevocable option to elect fair value for the initial and subsequent measurement for certain financial assets and liabilities on a contract-by-contract basis with the difference between the carrying value before election of the fair value option and the fair value recorded upon election as an adjustment to beginning retained deficit. as of june\u00a030, 2009, we had not elected the fair value option for any eligible financial asset or liability.  recent accounting pronouncements not yet adopted  in june 2009, the fasb issued sfas no.\u00a0167, amendments to fasb interpretation no.\u00a046(r), which is effective for us beginning july\u00a01, 2010. this statement amends fin 46(r), consolidation of variable interest entities an interpretation of arb no.\u00a051, to require revised evaluations of whether entities represent variable interest entities, ongoing assessments of control over such entities, and additional disclosures for variable interests. we believe the adoption of this pronouncement will not have a material impact on our financial statements.  in february 2008, the fasb issued fsp fas 157-2, effective date of fasb statement no.\u00a0157, which delays the effective date of sfas no.\u00a0157 for us to july\u00a01, 2009, for all nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities, except for items that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis (at least annually). we believe the adoption of the delayed items of sfas no.\u00a0157 will not have a material impact on our financial statements.  in december 2007, the fasb issued sfas no.\u00a0141(r), business combinations, which replaces sfas no.\u00a0141. the statement retains the fundamental requirements in sfas no.\u00a0141 that the acquisition method of accounting (previously referred to as the purchase method of accounting) be used for all business combinations, but requires a number of changes, including changes in the way assets and liabilities are recognized as a result of business combinations. it also requires the capitalization of in-process research and development at fair value and requires the expensing of acquisition-related costs as incurred. in april 2009, the fasb issued fsp fas 141(r)-1 which amends sfas no.\u00a0141(r) by establishing a model to account for certain pre-acquisition contingencies. under the fsp, an   \u00a0 \u00a0    table of contents  \u00a0part ii\u00a0  item 7  \u00a0 \u00a0  acquirer is required to recognize at fair value an asset acquired or a liability assumed in a business combination that arises from a contingency if the acquisition-date fair value of that asset or liability can be determined during the measurement period. if the acquisition-date fair value cannot be determined, then the acquirer should follow the recognition criteria in sfas no.\u00a05, accounting for contingencies, and fasb interpretation no.\u00a014, reasonable estimation of the amount of a loss \u0096 an interpretation of fasb statement no.\u00a05. sfas no.\u00a0141(r) and fsp fas 141(r)-1 are effective for us beginning july\u00a01, 2009, and will apply prospectively to business combinations completed on or after that date. the impact of the adoption of sfas no.\u00a0141(r) and fsp fas 141(r)-1 will depend on the nature of acquisitions completed after the date of adoption.  in december 2007, the fasb issued sfas no.\u00a0160, noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements\u00a0\u0096 an amendment of arb no.\u00a051, which changes the accounting and reporting for minority interests. minority interests will be recharacterized as noncontrolling interests and will be reported as a component of equity separate from the parent\u0092s equity, and purchases or sales of equity interests that do not result in a change in control will be accounted for as equity transactions. in addition, net income attributable to the noncontrolling interest will be included in net income and, upon a loss of control, the interest sold, as well as any interest retained, will be recorded at fair value with any gain or loss recognized in net income. sfas no.\u00a0160 is effective for us beginning july\u00a01, 2009, and will apply prospectively, except for the presentation and disclosure requirements, which will apply retrospectively. we believe the adoption of sfas\u00a0no.\u00a0160 will not have a material impact on our financial statements.  application of critical accounting policies  our financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with u.s. gaap. preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. these estimates and assumptions are affected by management\u0092s application of accounting policies. critical accounting policies for us include revenue recognition, impairment of investment securities, impairment of goodwill, accounting for research and development costs, accounting for contingencies, accounting for income taxes, accounting for stock-based compensation, and accounting for product warranties.  revenue recognition  we account for the licensing of software in accordance with american institute of certified public accountants statement of position (\u0093sop\u0094) 97-2, software revenue recognition. the application of sop 97-2 requires judgment, including whether a software arrangement includes multiple elements, and if so, whether vendor-specific objective evidence (\u0093vsoe\u0094) of fair value exists for those elements.  a portion of the revenue related to windows xp is recorded as unearned due to undelivered elements including, in some cases, free post-delivery telephone support and the right to receive unspecified upgrades/enhancements of microsoft internet explorer on a when-and-if-available basis. the amount of revenue allocated to undelivered elements is based on the vsoe of fair value for those elements using the residual method or relative fair value method. unearned revenue due to undelivered elements is recognized ratably on a straight-line basis over the related products\u0092 life cycles. revenue related to windows vista is not subject to a similar deferral because there are no significant undelivered elements. however, windows vista revenue is subject to deferral as a result of the windows 7 upgrade option program which started june\u00a026, 2009. the program allows customers who purchase pcs from participating computer makers or retailers with certain versions of windows vista to receive an upgrade to the corresponding version of windows 7 at minimal or no cost. in addition, purchasers of retail packaged windows vista may also qualify for a free or discounted upgrade to the equivalent windows 7 product with participating retailers in participating markets when the product becomes generally available. accordingly, estimated revenue related to the undelivered windows 7 product is deferred until the product is delivered.  changes to the elements in a software arrangement, the ability to identify vsoe for those elements, the fair value of the respective elements, and changes to a product\u0092s estimated life cycle could materially impact the amount of earned and unearned revenue. judgment is also required to assess whether future releases of certain software represent new products or upgrades and enhancements to existing products.  impairment of investment securities  sfas no.\u00a0115, accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities, staff accounting bulletin no.\u00a0111, and fsp fas 115-2 and fas 124-2, recognition and presentation of other-than-temporary impairments, provide guidance   \u00a0 \u00a0  table of contents  \u00a0part ii\u00a0  item 7  \u00a0 \u00a0  on determining when an investment is other-than-temporarily impaired. investments are reviewed quarterly for indicators of other-than-temporary impairment. this determination requires significant judgment. in making this judgment, we employ a systematic methodology quarterly that considers available quantitative and qualitative evidence in evaluating potential impairment of our investments. if the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value, we evaluate, among other factors, general market conditions, credit quality of debt instrument issuers, the duration and extent to which the fair value is less than cost, and for equity securities, our intent and ability to hold, or plans to sell, the investment. for fixed income securities, we also evaluate whether we have plans to sell the security or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery. we also consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of and business outlook for the investee, including industry and sector performance, changes in technology, and operational and financing cash flow factors. once a decline in fair value is determined to be other than temporary, an impairment charge is recorded to other income (expense) and a new cost basis in the investment is established. if market, industry, and/or investee conditions deteriorate, we may incur future impairments.  goodwill  sfas no.\u00a0142, goodwill and other intangible assets, requires that goodwill be tested for impairment at the reporting unit level (operating segment or one level below an operating segment) on an annual basis and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. these events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate, legal factors, operating performance indicators, competition, or sale or disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit. application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment, including the identification of reporting units, assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units, assignment of goodwill to reporting units, and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit. the fair value of each reporting unit is estimated using a discounted cash flow methodology. this analysis requires significant judgments, including estimation of future cash flows, which is dependent on internal forecasts, estimation of the long-term rate of growth for our business, estimation of the useful life over which cash flows will occur, and determination of our weighted average cost of capital. changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and goodwill impairment for each reporting unit. we allocate goodwill to reporting units based on the reporting unit expected to benefit from the combination. we evaluate our reporting units on an annual basis and, if necessary, reassign goodwill using a relative fair value allocation approach.  during the second quarter of fiscal year 2009, we changed the date of our annual impairment test from july\u00a01 to may\u00a01.\u00a0the change was made to more closely align the impairment testing date with our long-range planning and forecasting process.\u00a0we believe the change in accounting principle related to changing our annual impairment testing date did not delay, accelerate, or avoid an impairment charge.\u00a0we have determined that this change in accounting principle is preferable under the circumstances and does not result in adjustments to our financial statements when applied retrospectively.\u00a0during fiscal year 2009, the annual impairment test was performed as of july\u00a01, 2008 and was performed again as of may\u00a01, 2009. research and development costs  we account for research and development costs in accordance with applicable accounting pronouncements, including sfas no.\u00a02, accounting for research and development costs, and sfas no.\u00a086, accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold, leased, or otherwise marketed. sfas no.\u00a086 specifies that costs incurred internally in researching and developing a computer software product should be charged to expense until technological feasibility has been established for the product. once technological feasibility is established, all software costs should be capitalized until the product is available for general release to customers. judgment is required in determining when technological feasibility of a product is established. we have determined that technological feasibility for our software products is reached after all high-risk development issues have been resolved through coding and testing. generally, this occurs shortly before the products are released to manufacturing. the amortization of these costs is included in cost of revenue over the estimated life of the products.  \u00a0 \u00a0    table of contents  \u00a0part ii\u00a0  item 7  \u00a0 \u00a0 legal and other contingencies  the outcomes of legal proceedings and claims brought against us are subject to significant uncertainty. sfas no.\u00a05, accounting for contingencies, requires that an estimated loss from a loss contingency such as a legal proceeding or claim should be accrued by a charge to income if it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. disclosure of a contingency is required if there is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss has been incurred. in determining whether a loss should be accrued we evaluate, among other factors, the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss. changes in these factors could materially impact our results of operations, financial position, or our cash flows.  income taxes  sfas no.\u00a0109, accounting for income taxes, establishes financial accounting and reporting standards for the effect of income taxes. the objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entity\u0092s financial statements or tax returns. accruals for uncertain tax positions are provided for in accordance with the requirements of fin no.\u00a048, accounting for uncertainty in income taxes \u0096 an interpretation of fasb statement no.\u00a0109. under fin no. 48, we may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position should be measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. fin no. 48 also provides guidance on derecognition of income tax assets and liabilities, classification of current and deferred income tax assets and liabilities, accounting for interest and penalties associated with tax positions, and income tax disclosures. judgment is required in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns. variations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could materially impact our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.  stock-based compensation  we account for stock-based compensation in accordance with sfas no.\u00a0123(r), share-based payment. under the fair value recognition provisions of this statement, stock-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period. determining the fair value of stock-based awards at the grant date requires judgment, including estimating expected dividends. in addition, judgment is also required in estimating the amount of stock-based awards that are expected to be forfeited. if actual results differ significantly from these estimates, stock-based compensation expense and our results of operations could be impacted.  product warranties  we account for product warranties in accordance with sfas no.\u00a05, accounting for contingencies. we provide for the estimated costs of hardware and software warranties at the time the related revenue is recognized. for hardware warranty, we estimate the costs based on historical and projected product failure rates, historical and projected repair costs, and knowledge of specific product failures (if any). the specific hardware warranty terms and conditions vary depending upon the product sold and country in which we do business, but generally include parts and labor over a period generally ranging from 90\u00a0days to three years. for software warranty, we estimate the costs to provide bug fixes, such as security patches, over the life of the software. we regularly reevaluate our estimates to assess the adequacy of the recorded warranty liabilities and adjust the amounts as necessary.  \u00a0 \u00a0  table of contents  \u00a0part ii\u00a0  item 7  \u00a0 \u00a0 statement of management\u0092s responsibility for financial statements  management is responsible for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements and related information that are presented in this report. the consolidated financial statements, which include amounts based on management\u0092s estimates and judgments, have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america.  the company designs and maintains accounting and internal control systems to provide reasonable assurance at reasonable cost that assets are safeguarded against loss from unauthorized use or disposition, and that the financial records are reliable for preparing financial statements and maintaining accountability for assets. these systems are augmented by written policies, an organizational structure providing division of responsibilities, careful selection and training of qualified personnel, and a program of internal audits.  the company engaged deloitte\u00a0& touche llp, an independent registered public accounting firm, to audit and render an opinion on the consolidated financial statements and internal control over financial reporting in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board (united states).  the board of directors, through its audit committee, consisting solely of independent directors of the company, meets periodically with management, internal auditors, and our independent registered public accounting firm to ensure that each is meeting its responsibilities and to discuss matters concerning internal controls and financial reporting. deloitte\u00a0& touche llp and the internal auditors each have full and free access to the audit committee.  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0    table of contents  \u00a0part ii\u00a0  item 7a  \u00a0 \u00a0  item\u00a07a.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0quantative and qualitative disclosures about market risk  risks  we are exposed to economic risk from foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, credit risk, equity prices, and commodity prices. a portion of these risks is hedged, but they may impact results of operations cash flows and financial condition.  foreign currency.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0certain forecasted transactions, assets, and liabilities are exposed to foreign currency risk. we monitor our foreign currency exposures daily and use hedges where practicable to offset the risks and maximize the economic effectiveness of our foreign currency positions. principal currencies hedged include the euro, japanese yen, british pound, and canadian dollar.  interest rate.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0our fixed-income portfolio is diversified across credit sectors and maturities, consisting primarily of investment-grade securities. the credit risk and average maturity of the fixed-income portfolio is managed to achieve economic returns that correlate to certain global and domestic fixed-income indices. in addition, we use \u0093to be announced\u0094 forward purchase commitments of mortgage-backed assets to gain exposure to agency and mortgage-backed securities.  equity.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0our equity portfolio consists of global, developed, and emerging market securities that are subject to market price risk.\u00a0we manage the securities relative to certain global and domestic indices and expect their economic risk and return to correlate with these indices.  commodity.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0we use broad-based commodity exposures to enhance portfolio returns and facilitate portfolio diversification. our investment portfolio has exposure to a variety of commodities, including precious metals, energy, and grain. we manage these exposures relative to global commodity indices and expect their economic risk and return to correlate with these indices.  value-at-risk  we use a value-at-risk (\u0093var\u0094) model to estimate and quantify our market risks. var is the expected loss, for a given confidence level, in fair value of our portfolio due to adverse market movements over a defined time horizon. the var model is not intended to represent actual losses in fair value, including determinations of other-than-temporary losses in fair value in accordance with u.s. gaap, but is used as a risk estimation and management tool. the distribution of the potential changes in total market value of all holdings is computed based on the historical volatilities and correlations among foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, equity prices, and commodity prices, assuming normal market conditions.  the var is calculated as the total loss that will not be exceeded at the 97.5 percentile confidence level or, alternatively stated, the losses could exceed the var in 25 out of 1,000 cases. several risk factors are not captured in the model, including liquidity risk, operational risk, and legal risk.  the following table sets forth the one-day var for substantially all of our positions as of june 30, 2009 and 2008 and for the year ended june\u00a030, 2009:  \u00a0 total one-day var for the combined risk categories was $211 million at june\u00a030, 2009 and $123 million at june\u00a030, 2008. the total var is 25% less at june\u00a030, 2009, and 34% less at june\u00a030, 2008, than the sum of the separate risk categories in the above table due to the diversification benefit of the overall portfolio.  \u00a0 \u00a0  table of contents  \u00a0part ii\u00a0  item 8  \u00a0 \u00a0  stockholders\u0092 equity statements  \u00a0 see accompanying notes.  \u00a0 \u00a0  table of contents  \u00a0part ii\u00a0  item 8  \u00a0 \u00a0  notes to financial statements  note 1\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0accounting policies  accounting principles  the financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america.  principles of consolidation  the financial statements include the accounts of microsoft corporation and its subsidiaries. intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated. equity investments in which we exercise significant influence but do not control and are not the primary beneficiary are accounted for using the equity method. investments in which we are not able to exercise significant influence over the investee and which do not have readily determinable fair values are accounted for under the cost method.  estimates and assumptions  preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. examples include estimates of loss contingencies, product warranties, product life cycles, product returns, and stock-based compensation forfeiture rates; assumptions such as the elements comprising a software arrangement, including the distinction between upgrades/enhancements and new products; when technological feasibility is achieved for our products; the potential outcome of future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns; estimating the fair value and/or goodwill impairment for our reporting units; and determining when investment impairments are other-than-temporary. actual results and outcomes may differ from management\u0092s estimates and assumptions.  foreign currencies  assets and liabilities recorded in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rate on the balance sheet date. revenue and expenses are translated at average rates of exchange prevailing during the year. translation adjustments resulting from this process are recorded to other comprehensive income (\u0093oci\u0094).  effective july\u00a01, 2008, we began presenting gains and losses resulting from foreign currency remeasurements as a component of other income (expense). prior to july\u00a01, 2008, we included gains and losses resulting from foreign currency remeasurements as a component of sales and marketing expense.\u00a0we changed our presentation because this better reflects how we manage these foreign currency exposures, as such gains and losses arising from the remeasurement of foreign currency transactions are incidental to our operations. prior period amounts have been recast to conform to the current period presentation. see note 3 \u0096 other income (expense).  revenue recognition  revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the fee is fixed or determinable, and collectibility is probable. we enter into certain arrangements where we are obligated to deliver multiple products and/or services (multiple elements). in these arrangements, we generally allocate the total revenue among the elements based on the sales price of each element when sold separately (vendor-specific objective evidence).  revenue for retail packaged products, products licensed to original equipment manufacturers (\u0093oems\u0094), and perpetual licenses for current products under our open and select volume licensing programs generally is recognized as products are shipped. a portion of the revenue related to windows xp is recorded as unearned due to undelivered elements including, in some cases, free post-delivery telephone support and the right to receive unspecified upgrades/enhancements of microsoft internet explorer on a when-and-if-available basis. the amount of revenue allocated to undelivered elements is based on the vendor-specific objective evidence of fair value for those elements using the residual method or relative fair value method. unearned revenue due to undelivered elements is recognized   \u00a0 \u00a0    table of contents  \u00a0part ii\u00a0  item 8  \u00a0 \u00a0  ratably on a straight-line basis over the related products\u0092 life cycles. revenue related to windows vista is not subject to a similar deferral because there are no significant undelivered elements. however, windows vista revenue is subject to deferral as a result of the windows 7 upgrade option program which started june\u00a026, 2009. the program allows customers who purchase pcs from participating computer makers or retailers with certain versions of windows vista to receive an upgrade to the corresponding version of windows 7 at minimal or no cost. in addition, purchasers of retail packaged windows vista may also qualify for a free or discounted upgrade to the equivalent windows 7 product with participating retailers in participating markets when the product becomes generally available. accordingly, estimated revenue related to the undelivered windows 7 product is deferred until the product is delivered.  revenue from multi-year licensing arrangements are accounted for as subscriptions, with billings recorded as unearned revenue and recognized as revenue ratably over the billing coverage period. certain multi-year licensing arrangements include rights to receive future versions of software product on a when-and-if-available basis under open and select volume licensing programs (software assurance). in addition, other multi-year licensing arrangements include a perpetual license for current products combined with rights to receive future versions of software products on a when-and-if-available basis under open, select, and enterprise agreement volume licensing programs. premier support services agreements, msn internet access subscriptions, xbox live, and microsoft developer network subscriptions are also accounted for as subscriptions.  revenue related to our xbox 360 game console, games published by us, and other hardware components is generally recognized when ownership is transferred to the retailers. revenue related to games published by third parties for use on the xbox 360 platform is recognized when games are manufactured by the game publishers. display advertising revenue is recognized as advertisements are displayed. search advertising revenue is recognized when the ad appears in the search results or when the action necessary to earn the revenue has been completed. consulting services revenue is recognized as services are rendered, generally based on the negotiated hourly rate in the consulting arrangement and the number of hours worked during the period. consulting revenue for fixed-price services arrangements is recognized as services are provided.  revenue generally is recognized net of any taxes collected from customers and subsequently remitted to governmental authorities.  cost of revenue  cost of revenue includes manufacturing and distribution costs for products sold and programs licensed, operating costs related to product support service centers and product distribution centers, costs incurred to drive traffic to our website and/or acquire online advertising space (\u0093traffic acquisitions costs\u0094), costs incurred to support and maintain internet-based products and services, warranty costs, inventory valuation adjustments, costs associated with the delivery of consulting services, and the amortization of capitalized research and development costs associated with software products that have reached technological feasibility. capitalized research and development costs are amortized over the estimated lives of the products.  product warranty  we provide for the estimated costs of fulfilling our obligations under hardware and software warranties at the time the related revenue is recognized. for hardware warranties, we estimate the costs based on historical and projected product failure rates, historical and projected repair costs, and knowledge of specific product failures (if any). the specific hardware warranty terms and conditions vary depending upon the product sold and the country in which we do business, but generally include parts and labor over a period generally ranging from 90\u00a0days to three years. for software warranties, we estimate the costs to provide bug fixes, such as security patches, over the estimated life of the software.  research and development  research and development expenses include payroll, employee benefits, stock-based compensation, and other headcount-related expenses associated with product development. research and development expenses also include third-party development and programming costs, localization costs incurred to translate software for international markets, the amortization of purchased software code and services content, and in-process research and development. such costs related to software development are included in research and development expense until   \u00a0 \u00a0  table of contents  \u00a0part ii\u00a0  item 8  \u00a0 \u00a0  the point that technological feasibility is reached, which for our software products, is generally shortly before the products are released to manufacturing. once technological feasibility is reached, such costs are capitalized and amortized to cost of revenue over the estimated lives of the products.  sales and marketing  sales and marketing expenses include payroll, employee benefits, stock-based compensation, and other headcount-related expenses associated with sales and marketing personnel, and the costs of advertising, promotions, tradeshows, seminars, and other programs. advertising costs are expensed as incurred. advertising expense was $1.4 billion, $1.2 billion, and $1.3 billion in fiscal years 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively.  employee severance  we record employee severance when a specific plan has been approved by management, the plan has been communicated to employees, and it is unlikely that significant changes will be made to the plan.  stock-based compensation  we account for stock-based compensation in accordance with sfas no.\u00a0123(r), share-based payment. under the fair value recognition provisions of this statement, stock-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the applicable vesting period of the stock award (generally four to five years) using the straight-line method.  income taxes  income tax expense includes u.s. and international income taxes, plus the provision for u.s. taxes on undistributed earnings of international subsidiaries not deemed to be permanently invested. certain income and expenses are not reported in tax returns and financial statements in the same year. the tax effect of such temporary differences is reported as deferred income taxes.  financial instruments  we consider all highly liquid interest-earning investments with a maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase to be cash equivalents. the fair value of these investments approximates their carrying value. in general, investments with original maturities of greater than three months and remaining maturities of less than one year are classified as short-term investments. investments with maturities beyond one year may be classified as short-term based on their highly liquid nature and because such marketable securities represent the investment of cash that is available for current operations. all cash equivalents and short-term investments are classified as available-for-sale and realized gains and losses are recorded using the specific identification method. changes in market value, excluding other-than-temporary impairments, are reflected in oci.  equity and other investments classified as long-term include both debt and equity instruments. debt and publicly-traded equity securities are classified as available-for-sale and realized gains and losses are recorded using the specific identification method. changes in market value, excluding other-than-temporary impairments, are reflected in oci. common and preferred stock and other investments that are restricted for more than one year or are not publicly traded are recorded at cost or using the equity method.  we lend certain fixed-income and equity securities to enhance investment income. the loaned securities continue to be carried as investments on our balance sheet. collateral and/or security interests received (securities pledged as collateral) are determined based upon the underlying security lent and the creditworthiness of the borrower. cash collateral is recorded as an asset with a corresponding liability.  investments are considered to be impaired when a decline in fair value is judged to be other-than-temporary. we employ a systematic methodology on a quarterly basis that considers available quantitative and qualitative evidence in evaluating potential impairment of our investments. if the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value, we evaluate, among other factors, general market conditions, credit quality of debt instrument issuers, the duration and extent to which the fair value is less than cost, and for equity securities, our intent and ability to hold, or plans to   \u00a0 \u00a0    table of contents  \u00a0part ii\u00a0  item 8  \u00a0 \u00a0  sell, the investment. for fixed income securities, we also evaluate whether we have plans to sell the security or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery. we also consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of and business outlook for the investee, including industry and sector performance, changes in technology, and operational and financing cash flow factors. once a decline in fair value is determined to be other-than-temporary, an impairment charge is recorded to other income (expense) and a new cost basis in the investment is established.  derivative instruments are recognized as either assets or liabilities and are measured at fair value. the accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation. see note 5 \u0096 derivatives.  our current financial liabilities, including our short-term debt, have fair values that approximate their carrying values. our long-term financial liabilities consist of long-term debt which is recorded on the balance sheet at issuance price less unamortized discount.  allowance for doubtful accounts  the allowance for doubtful accounts reflects our best estimate of probable losses inherent in the accounts receivable balance. we determine the allowance based on known troubled accounts, historical experience, and other currently available evidence. activity in the allowance for doubtful accounts was as follows:  \u00a0 inventories  inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market, using the average cost method. cost includes materials, labor, and manufacturing overhead related to the purchase and production of inventories. we regularly review inventory quantities on hand, future purchase commitments with our suppliers, and the estimated utility of our inventory. if our review indicates a reduction in utility below carrying value, we reduce our inventory to a new cost basis through a charge to cost of revenue.  property and equipment  property and equipment is stated at cost and depreciated using the straight-line method over the shorter of the estimated life of the asset or the lease term, ranging from one to 15 years. computer software developed or obtained for internal use is depreciated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the software, generally three years.  goodwill   goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis and between annual tests if indicators of potential impairment exist, using a fair-value-based approach. during the second quarter of fiscal year 2009, we changed the date of our annual impairment test from july\u00a01 to may\u00a01.\u00a0the change was made to more closely align the impairment testing date with our long-range planning and forecasting process.\u00a0we believe the change in our annual impairment testing date did not delay, accelerate, or avoid an impairment charge.\u00a0we have determined that this change in accounting principle is preferable under the circumstances and does not result in adjustments to our financial statements when applied retrospectively.\u00a0see note 10 \u0096 goodwill.  \u00a0 \u00a0  table of contents  \u00a0part ii\u00a0  item 8  \u00a0 \u00a0 intangible assets  intangible assets are amortized using the straight-line method over their estimated period of benefit, ranging from one to 10 years. we evaluate the recoverability of intangible assets periodically by taking into account events or circumstances that may warrant revised estimates of useful lives or that may indicate the asset may be impaired. all of our intangible assets are subject to amortization. no material impairments of intangible assets have been identified during any of the periods presented.  subsequent events  we evaluated events occurring between the end of our most recent fiscal year and july\u00a029, 2009, the date the financial statements were issued.  recently issued accounting standards  recently adopted accounting pronouncements  on april\u00a01, 2009, we adopted the financial accounting standards board (\u0093fasb\u0094) staff positions (\u0093fsp\u0094) fas 157-4, fsp fas 115-2 and fas 124-2, and fsp fas 107-1 and apb 28-1. these fsps are intended to provide additional application guidance and enhance disclosures about fair value measurements and impairments of securities. fsp fas 157-4 clarifies the objective and method of fair value measurement even when there has been a significant decrease in market activity for the asset being measured. fsp fas 115-2 and fas 124-2 establishes a new model for measuring other-than-temporary impairments for debt securities, including establishing criteria for when to recognize a write-down through earnings versus other comprehensive income. fsp fas\u00a0107-1 and apb 28-1 expands the fair value disclosures required for all financial instruments within the scope of sfas no.\u00a0107, disclosures about fair value of financial instruments, to interim periods. adoption of these fsps did not have a significant impact on our accounting for financial instruments but did expand our associated disclosures.  on january\u00a01, 2009, we adopted statement of financial accounting standards (\u0093sfas\u0094) no.\u00a0161, disclosures about derivative instruments and hedging activities, an amendment of fasb statement no.\u00a0133. sfas no.\u00a0161 requires additional disclosures about the company\u0092s objectives in using derivative instruments and hedging activities, the method of accounting for such instruments under sfas no.\u00a0133, accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities, and its related interpretations, and tabular disclosures of the effects of such instruments and related hedged items on our financial position, financial performance, and cash flows. see note 5 \u0096 derivatives.  on july\u00a01, 2008, we adopted sfas no.\u00a0157, fair value measurements, for all financial assets and liabilities and nonfinancial assets and liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis (at least annually).\u00a0sfas no.\u00a0157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. this statement does not require any new fair value measurements, but provides guidance on how to measure fair value by providing a fair value hierarchy used to classify the source of the information. see note 4 \u0096 investments.  sfas no.\u00a0159, the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities-including an amendment of fasb statement no.\u00a0115, became effective for us on july\u00a01, 2008. sfas no.\u00a0159 gives us the irrevocable option to elect fair value for the initial and subsequent measurement for certain financial assets and liabilities on a contract-by-contract basis with the difference between the carrying value before election of the fair value option and the fair value recorded upon election as an adjustment to beginning retained deficit. as of june\u00a030, 2009, we had not elected the fair value option for any eligible financial asset or liability.  recent accounting pronouncements not yet adopted  in june 2009, the fasb issued sfas no.\u00a0167, amendments to fasb interpretation no.\u00a046(r), which is effective for us beginning july\u00a01, 2010. this statement amends financial accounting standards board interpretation (\u0093fin\u0094) no.\u00a046(r), consolidation of variable interest entities an interpretation of arb no.\u00a051, to require revised evaluations of whether entities represent variable interest entities, ongoing assessments of control over such entities, and additional disclosures for variable interests. we believe the adoption of this pronouncement will not have a material impact on our financial statements.  in february 2008, the fasb issued fsp fas 157-2, effective date of fasb statement no.\u00a0157, which delays the effective date of sfas no.\u00a0157 for us to july\u00a01, 2009, for all nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities, except   \u00a0 \u00a0    table of contents  \u00a0part ii\u00a0  item 8  \u00a0 \u00a0  for items that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis (at least annually). we believe the adoption of the delayed items of sfas no.\u00a0157 will not have a material impact on our financial statements.  in december 2007, the fasb issued sfas no.\u00a0141(r), business combinations, which replaces sfas no.\u00a0141. the statement retains the fundamental requirements in sfas no.\u00a0141 that the acquisition method of accounting (previously referred to as the purchase method of accounting) be used for all business combinations, but requires a number of changes, including changes in the way assets and liabilities are recognized as a result of business combinations. it also requires the capitalization of in-process research and development at fair value and requires the expensing of acquisition-related costs as incurred. in april 2009, the fasb issued fsp fas 141(r)-1 which amends sfas no.\u00a0141(r) by establishing a model to account for certain pre-acquisition contingencies. under the fsp, an acquirer is required to recognize at fair value an asset acquired or a liability assumed in a business combination that arises from a contingency if the acquisition-date fair value of that asset or liability can be determined during the measurement period. if the acquisition-date fair value cannot be determined, then the acquirer should follow the recognition criteria in sfas no.\u00a05, accounting for contingencies, and fasb interpretation no.\u00a014, reasonable estimation of the amount of a loss \u0096 an interpretation of fasb statement no.\u00a05. sfas no.\u00a0141(r) and fsp fas 141(r)-1 are effective for us beginning july\u00a01, 2009, and will apply prospectively to business combinations completed on or after that date. the impact of the adoption of sfas no.\u00a0141(r) and fsp fas 141(r)-1 will depend on the nature of acquisitions completed after the date of adoption.  in december 2007, the fasb issued sfas no.\u00a0160, noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements\u00a0\u0096 an amendment of arb no.\u00a051, which changes the accounting and reporting for minority interests. minority interests will be recharacterized as noncontrolling interests and will be reported as a component of equity separate from the parent\u0092s equity, and purchases or sales of equity interests that do not result in a change in control will be accounted for as equity transactions. in addition, net income attributable to the noncontrolling interest will be included in net income and, upon a loss of control, the interest sold, as well as any interest retained, will be recorded at fair value with any gain or loss recognized in net income. sfas no.\u00a0160 is effective for us beginning july\u00a01, 2009, and will apply prospectively, except for the presentation and disclosure requirements, which will apply retrospectively. we believe the adoption of sfas\u00a0no.\u00a0160 will not have a material impact on our financial statements.  note 2\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0earnings per share  basic earnings per share is computed on the basis of the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. diluted earnings per share is computed on the basis of the weighted average number of shares of common stock plus the effect of dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period using the treasury stock method. dilutive potential common shares include outstanding stock options, stock awards, and shared performance stock awards. the components of basic and diluted earnings per share are as follows:  \u00a0 for the years ended june\u00a030, 2009, 2008, and 2007, 342\u00a0million, 91\u00a0million, and 199\u00a0million shares, respectively, were attributable to outstanding stock-based awards and were excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per share because their inclusion would have been anti-dilutive.  \u00a0 \u00a0  table of contents  \u00a0part ii\u00a0  item 8  \u00a0 \u00a0 note 3\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0other income (expense)  the components of other income (expense) were as follows:  \u00a0 effective july\u00a01, 2008, we began presenting gains and losses resulting from foreign currency remeasurements as a component of other income (expense). prior to july\u00a01, 2008, we included gains and losses resulting from foreign currency remeasurements as a component of sales and marketing expense.\u00a0we changed our presentation because this better reflects how we manage these foreign currency exposures, as such gains and losses arising from the remeasurement of foreign currency transactions are incidental to our operations.\u00a0for fiscal year 2009, $509 million of losses were reported as other income (expense). for fiscal years 2008 and 2007, $221 million and $86 million of gains, respectively, were previously recorded as a component of sales and marketing expense and have been recast as other income (expense).  net recognized gains (losses) on investments included other-than-temporary impairments of $862 million, $312 million, and $25 million in fiscal years 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively. realized gains and losses from sales of available-for-sale securities (excluding other-than-temporary impairments) were $1.6 billion and $897 million, respectively, in fiscal year 2009, $751 million and $93 million, respectively, in fiscal year 2008, and $851 million and $176 million, respectively, in fiscal year 2007.

losses on investments  investments with continuous unrealized losses for less than 12 months and 12 months or greater and their related fair values were as follows:  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  table of contents  \u00a0part ii\u00a0  item 8  \u00a0 \u00a0 at june\u00a030, 2009, unrealized losses of $285 million consisted of: $79 million related to investment grade fixed-income securities, $24 million related to investments in high yield and emerging market fixed-income securities, $110 million related to domestic equity securities, and $72 million related to international equity securities. at june\u00a030, 2008, unrealized losses of $255 million consisted of: $121 million related to investment grade fixed-income securities, $21 million related to investments in high yield and emerging market fixed-income securities, $99 million related to domestic equity securities, and $14 million related to international equity securities. unrealized losses from fixed-income securities are primarily attributable to changes in interest rates. unrealized losses from domestic and international equities are due to market price movements. management does not believe any unrealized losses represent other-than-temporary impairments based on our evaluation of available evidence as of june\u00a030, 2009.  at june\u00a030, 2009, the recorded basis and estimated fair value of common and preferred stock and other investments that are restricted for more than one year or are not publicly traded was $204 million. at june\u00a030, 2008, the recorded basis and estimated fair value of these investments was $289 million. the estimate of fair value is based on publicly available market information or other estimates determined by management.  debt investment maturities  \u00a0 note 5\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0derivatives  we use derivative instruments to manage risks related to foreign currencies, equity prices, interest rates, and credit; to enhance investment returns; and to facilitate portfolio diversification. our objectives for holding derivatives include reducing, eliminating, and efficiently managing the economic impact of these exposures as effectively as possible. our derivative programs include strategies that both qualify and do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment under sfas no.\u00a0133, accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities.  foreign currency  certain forecasted transactions, assets, and liabilities are exposed to foreign currency risk. we monitor our foreign currency exposures daily to maximize the economic effectiveness of our foreign currency hedge positions. options and forward contracts are used to hedge a portion of forecasted international revenue for up to three years in the future and are designated as cash-flow hedging instruments. principal currencies hedged include the euro, japanese yen, british pound, and canadian dollar. as of june\u00a030, 2009, the total notional amount of such foreign exchange contracts was $7.2 billion.\u00a0foreign currency risks related to certain non-u.s. dollar denominated securities are hedged using foreign exchange forward contracts that are designated as fair-value hedging instruments. as of june\u00a030, 2009, the total notional amount of these foreign exchange contracts sold was $3.5 billion.\u00a0certain options and forwards not designated as hedging instruments are also used to manage the variability in exchange rates on accounts receivable, cash, and intercompany positions, and to manage other foreign currency exposures.\u00a0as of june\u00a030, 2009, the total notional amounts of these foreign exchange contracts purchased and sold were $3.2 billion and $3.6 billion, respectively.  equity  securities held in our equity and other investments portfolio are subject to market price risk.\u00a0market price risk is managed relative to broad-based global and domestic equity indices using certain convertible preferred investments, options, futures, and swap contracts not designated as hedging instruments. from time to time, to hedge our price   \u00a0 \u00a0    table of contents  \u00a0part ii\u00a0  item 8  \u00a0 \u00a0  risk, we may use and designate equity derivatives as hedging instruments, including puts, calls, swaps, and forwards.\u00a0as of june\u00a030, 2009, the total notional amounts of designated and non-designated equity contracts purchased and sold were immaterial.  interest rate  securities held in our fixed-income portfolio are subject to different interest rate risks based on their various maturities. the average maturity of the fixed-income portfolio is managed to achieve economic returns which correlate to certain broad-based fixed-income indices using exchange-traded option and futures contracts and over-the-counter swap and option contracts, none of which are designated as hedging instruments. as of june\u00a030, 2009, the total notional amount of fixed-interest rate contracts purchased and sold were $2.7 billion and $456 million, respectively. in addition, we use \u0093to be announced\u0094 forward purchase commitments of mortgage-backed assets to gain exposure to agency and mortgage-backed securities.\u00a0these meet the definition of a derivative instrument under sfas no.\u00a0133 in cases where physical delivery of the assets is not taken at the earliest available delivery date. as of june\u00a030, 2009, the total notional derivative amount of mortgage contracts purchased was $1.3 billion.  credit  our fixed-income portfolio is diversified and consists primarily of investment-grade securities. we use credit default swap contracts, not designated as hedging instruments, to manage credit exposures relative to broad-based indices and facilitate portfolio diversification. we use credit default swaps as they are a low cost way of managing exposure to individual credit risks or groups of credit risks while continuing to improve liquidity. as of june\u00a030, 2009, the total notional amounts of credit contracts purchased and sold were immaterial.  commodity  we use broad-based commodity exposures to enhance portfolio returns and facilitate portfolio diversification. we use swap and futures contracts, not designated as hedging instruments, to generate and manage exposures to broad-based commodity indices. we use derivatives on commodities as they are low-cost alternatives to the purchase and storage of a variety of commodities, including, but not limited to, precious metals, energy, and grain. as of june\u00a030, 2009, the total notional amounts of commodity contracts purchased and sold were $543 million and $33 million, respectively.  credit-risk-related contingent features  certain of our counterparty agreements for derivative instruments contain provisions that require our issued and outstanding long-term unsecured debt to maintain an investment grade credit rating and require us to maintain a minimum liquidity of $1.0 billion. to the extent we fail to meet these requirements, collateral will be required for posting, similar to the standard convention related to over-the-counter derivatives. as of june\u00a030, 2009, our long-term unsecured debt rating was aaa, and cash investments were in excess of $1.0 billion. as a result, no collateral is required to be posted.  \u00a0

comprehensive income (\u0093oci\u0094) and is subsequently recognized in earnings when the hedged exposure is recognized in earnings. for options designated as cash-flow hedges, changes in the time value are excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and are recognized in earnings. gains (losses) on derivatives representing either hedge components excluded from the assessment of effectiveness or hedge ineffectiveness are recognized in earnings. during fiscal year 2009, we recognized the following gains (losses) related to foreign exchange contracts:  \u00a0 we estimate that $528 million of net derivative gains included in oci will be reclassified into earnings within the next 12 months. no significant amounts of gains (losses) were reclassified from oci into earnings as a result of forecasted transactions that failed to occur during fiscal year 2009.  non-designated derivatives  gains (losses) from changes in fair values of derivatives that are not designated as hedges are recognized in other income (expense). other than those derivatives entered into for investment purposes, such as commodity contracts, the gains (losses) below are generally economically offset by unrealized gains (losses) in the underlying securities and are recorded as a component of oci. the amounts recognized during fiscal year 2009 were as follows:  \u00a0 gains (losses) for foreign exchange, equity, interest rate, credit, and commodity contracts presented in other income statement line items were immaterial for fiscal year 2009 and have been excluded from the table above.  note 6\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0fair value measurements  sfas no.\u00a0157 defines fair value as the price that would be received upon sale of an asset or paid upon transfer of a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date and in the principal or most advantageous market for that asset or liability. the fair value should be calculated based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, not on assumptions specific to the entity. in addition, the fair value of liabilities should include consideration of non-performance risk, including our own credit risk.  in addition to defining fair value, sfas no.\u00a0157 expands the disclosure requirements around fair value and establishes a fair value hierarchy for valuation inputs. the hierarchy prioritizes the inputs into three levels based on the extent to which inputs used in measuring fair value are observable in the market.\u00a0each fair value measurement is   \u00a0 \u00a0  table of contents  \u00a0part ii\u00a0  item 8  \u00a0 \u00a0  reported in one of the three levels, which is determined by the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. these levels are:  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 the following section describes the valuation methodologies we use to measure financial assets and liabilities at fair value.  investments other than derivatives  investments other than derivatives primarily include u.s. government and agency securities, foreign government bonds, mortgage-backed securities, commercial paper, corporate notes and bonds, and common and preferred stock.  in general, and where applicable, we use quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities to determine fair value.\u00a0this pricing methodology applies to our level 1 investments, such as domestic and international equities, u.s. treasuries, exchange-traded mutual funds, and agency securities.\u00a0if quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities are not available to determine fair value, then we use quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities or inputs other than the quoted prices that are observable either directly or indirectly.\u00a0these investments are included in level 2 and consist primarily of corporate notes and bonds, foreign government bonds, mortgage-backed securities, commercial paper, and certain agency securities.\u00a0our level 3 assets primarily include investments in certain corporate bonds.\u00a0we value the level 3 corporate bonds using internally developed valuation models, inputs to which include interest rate curves, credit spreads, stock prices, and volatilities. unobservable inputs used in these models are significant to the fair values of the investments. derivatives  in general, and where applicable, we use quoted prices in an active market for identical derivative assets and liabilities that are traded on exchanges. these derivative assets and liabilities are included in level 1. the fair values for the derivative assets and liabilities included in level 2 are estimated using industry standard valuation models, such as the black-scholes model.\u00a0where applicable, these models project future cash flows and discount the future amounts to a present value using market-based observable inputs including interest rate curves, foreign exchange rates, and forward and spot prices for currencies and commodities. level 2 derivative assets and liabilities primarily include certain over-the-counter options, futures, and swap contracts. in certain cases, market-based observable inputs are not available and we use management judgment to develop assumptions to determine fair value.\u00a0these derivative assets and liabilities are included in level 3 and primarily represent derivatives for foreign equities.  \u00a0 \u00a0    table of contents  \u00a0part ii\u00a0  item 8  \u00a0 \u00a0 assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis  the following table presents our assets and liabilities at june\u00a030, 2009, which are measured at fair value on a recurring basis:  \u00a0 \u00a0 changes in level 3 instruments measured at fair value on a recurring basis  the majority of our level 3 instruments consist of investment securities classified as available-for-sale with changes in fair value included in other comprehensive income. the following table presents the changes in level 3 instruments measured on a recurring basis for the year ended june\u00a030, 2009:  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  table of contents  \u00a0part ii\u00a0  item 8  \u00a0 \u00a0 assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis  we measure certain assets, including our cost and equity method investments, at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. these assets are recognized at fair value when they are deemed to be other-than-temporarily impaired. at june\u00a030, 2009, the fair value of the common and preferred stock that we held that was required to be measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis was $164 million. this fair value was determined using models with significant unobservable inputs.  in accordance with the provisions of accounting principles board opinion no.\u00a018, the equity method of accounting for investments in common stock, we review the carrying values of our investments when events and circumstances warrant, and we consider all available evidence in evaluating when declines in fair value are other than temporary. the fair values of our investments are determined based on valuation techniques using the best information available, and may include quoted market prices, market comparables, and discounted cash flow projections. an impairment charge is recorded when the cost of the investment exceeds its fair value and this condition is determined to be other than temporary. during the fiscal year ended june\u00a030, 2009, impairment charges of $86 million were recognized for certain investments measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis as the decline in their respective fair values below their cost was determined to be other than temporary in all instances.  note 7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0inventories  the components of inventories were as follows:  \u00a0 property and equipment are stated at cost. depreciation is computed principally on the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. the useful lives for buildings range from five to 15 years, leasehold improvements generally range from two to 10 years (representing the applicable lease terms plus reasonably assured extensions), computer equipment and software range from two to three years, and furniture and equipment range from one to five years. land is not depreciated.  \u00a0 \u00a0    table of contents  \u00a0part ii\u00a0  item 8  \u00a0 \u00a0 during fiscal years 2009, 2008, and 2007, depreciation expense was $1.7 billion, $1.4 billion, and $1.2 billion, respectively. the majority of depreciation expense in all years related to computer equipment.  note 9\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0acquisitions  we acquired nine entities during fiscal year 2009 for total consideration of $925 million, substantially all of which was paid in cash. all of the entities have been consolidated into our results of operations since their respective acquisition dates. the purchase price allocations for these acquisitions are preliminary for up to 12 months after the acquisition dates and are subject to revision as more detailed analyses are completed and additional information about the fair values of assets and liabilities becomes available. any change in the estimated fair value of the net assets of the acquired companies within this timeframe will change the amount of the purchase price allocable to goodwill. pro forma results of operations have not been presented because the effects of these acquisitions, individually and in the aggregate, were not material to our consolidated results of operations.  note 10\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0goodwill  changes in the carrying amount of goodwill for fiscal years 2009 and 2008 by segment were as follows:  \u00a0 none of the amounts recorded as goodwill are expected to be deductible for tax purposes. the purchase price allocations for all of the acquisitions are preliminary for up to 12 months after the acquisition date and are subject to revision as more detailed analyses are completed and additional information about fair value of the assets and liabilities become available. any change in the fair value of the net assets of the acquired company within this timeframe will change the amount of the purchase price allocable to goodwill. changes in goodwill amounts resulting from foreign currency translations are included in \u0093purchase accounting adjustments and other\u0094 in the above table.  we test goodwill for impairment annually at the reporting unit level using a fair value approach, in accordance with the provisions of sfas no.\u00a0142, goodwill and other intangible assets. during the second quarter of fiscal year 2009, we changed the date of our annual impairment test from july\u00a01 to may\u00a01.\u00a0the change was made to more closely align the impairment testing date with our long-range planning and forecasting process.\u00a0we believe the change in our annual impairment testing date did not delay, accelerate, or avoid an impairment charge.\u00a0we have determined that this change in accounting principle is preferable under the circumstances and does not result in adjustments to our financial statements when applied retrospectively.\u00a0during fiscal year 2009, the annual impairment test was performed as of july\u00a01, 2008 and was performed again as of may\u00a01, 2009. \u00a0 \u00a0  table of contents  \u00a0part ii\u00a0  item 8  \u00a0 \u00a0 note

of 0.20% and maturities of 22 to 119 days. the estimated fair value of this commercial paper approximates its carrying value.  in september 2008, we also entered into a $2.0 billion six-month senior unsecured credit facility, principally to support the commercial paper program. in november 2008, we replaced the six-month credit facility with a $2.0 billion 364-day credit facility. this credit facility expires on november\u00a06, 2009. in march 2009, we entered into an additional credit facility. this $1.0 billion 364-day credit facility expires on march\u00a012, 2010. as of june\u00a030, 2009, we were in compliance with the only financial covenant in both credit agreements, which requires us to maintain a coverage ratio of at least three times earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization to interest expense.\u00a0no amounts were drawn against these credit facilities during the year ended june\u00a030, 2009.  long-term debt  in november 2008, we filed a shelf registration statement with the u.s. securities and exchange commission that allows us to issue debt securities from time to time pursuant to the september 2008 authorization for debt financings of up to $6.0 billion. in may 2009, we issued $3.75 billion of debt securities under that registration statement (\u0093notes\u0094). interest on the notes will be payable semi-annually on june\u00a01 and december\u00a01 of each year, commencing on december\u00a01, 2009, to holders of record on the preceding may\u00a015 and november\u00a015.\u00a0the notes are senior unsecured obligations and will rank equally with our other unsecured and unsubordinated debt outstanding.  the components of long-term debt as of june\u00a030, 2009 were as follows:  \u00a0 maturities of long-term debt for the next five years are as follows:  \u00a0 as of june\u00a030, 2009, the total carrying value and estimated fair value of our long-term debt were $3.75 billion and $3.74 billion, respectively. the estimate of fair value is based on quoted prices for our publicly-traded debt as of june\u00a030, 2009. the effective interest yields of the notes due in 2014, 2019, and 2039 were 3.00%, 4.29%, and 5.22%, respectively, at june\u00a030, 2009.  \u00a0 \u00a0  table of contents  \u00a0part ii\u00a0  item 8  \u00a0 \u00a0 note 13\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0income taxes  the components of the provision for income taxes were as follows:  \u00a0 in general, other reconciling items consist of interest, u.s. state income taxes, domestic production deductions, and research credits. in fiscal years 2009 and 2008, there were no individually significant other reconciling items. other reconciling items in fiscal year 2007 included the impact of a $195 million reduction resulting from various changes in tax positions taken in prior periods, related primarily to favorable developments in an irs position and multiple foreign audit assessments.  \u00a0 \u00a0    table of contents  \u00a0part ii\u00a0  item 8  \u00a0 \u00a0 the components of the deferred income tax assets and liabilities were as follows:  \u00a0 deferred income tax balances reflect the effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases and are stated at enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when the taxes are actually paid or recovered.  we have not provided deferred u.s. income taxes or foreign withholding taxes on temporary differences of approximately $18.0 billion resulting from earnings for certain non-u.s. subsidiaries which are permanently reinvested outside the united states. the unrecognized deferred tax liability associated with these temporary differences is approximately $5.4 billion.  income taxes paid were $6.6 billion in fiscal year 2009, $5.4 billion in fiscal year 2008, and $5.2 billion in fiscal year 2007.  uncertain tax positions  as of june\u00a030, 2009, we had $5.4 billion of unrecognized tax benefits of which $4.4 billion, if recognized, would affect our effective tax rate. as of june\u00a030, 2008, we had $3.2 billion of unrecognized tax benefits of which $2.3 billion, if recognized, would affect our effective tax rate.  interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are included in income tax expense. such interest totaled $230 million in fiscal year 2009 and $121 million in fiscal year 2008. as of june\u00a030, 2009 and 2008, we had accrued interest related to uncertain tax positions of $554 million and $324 million, respectively, net of federal income tax benefits, on our balance sheets.  \u00a0 \u00a0  table of contents  \u00a0part ii\u00a0  item 8  \u00a0 \u00a0 the aggregate changes in the balance of unrecognized tax benefits were as follows:  \u00a0 during fiscal year 2008, we reached a settlement with the internal revenue service (\u0093irs\u0094) on its 2000-2003 examination.\u00a0as a result, we reduced our unrecognized tax benefits by $4.8 billion and recognized a tax provision reduction of $1.2 billion.\u00a0as a result of the 2000-2003 settlement and the related impact on subsequent years, we paid the irs approximately $4.1 billion during fiscal year 2009.  we are under audit by the irs for the tax years 2004-2006.\u00a0we do not believe it is reasonably possible that the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits will significantly increase or decrease within the next 12 months as we do not believe the examination will be concluded within the next 12 months.  we are subject to income tax in many jurisdictions outside the united states, none of which are individually material to our financial position, cash flows, or results of operations.  note 14\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0unearned revenue  unearned revenue is comprised of the following items:  volume licensing programs  represents customer billings for multi-year licensing arrangements, paid either upfront or annually at the beginning of each billing coverage period, which are accounted for as subscriptions with revenue recognized ratably over the billing coverage period.  undelivered elements  represents the right to receive unspecified upgrades/enhancements of microsoft internet explorer on a when-and-if-available basis and free post-delivery telephone support. this revenue deferral is applicable for windows xp and prior versions shipped as retail packaged products, products licensed to oems, and perpetual licenses for current products under our open and select volume licensing programs. the amount recorded as unearned is based on the sales price of those elements when sold separately and is recognized ratably on a straight-line basis over the related product\u0092s life cycle. product life cycles are currently estimated at three and one-half years for windows operating systems. undelivered elements include $276 million of deferred revenue related to the windows 7 upgrade option program.  other  represents payments for post-delivery support and consulting services to be performed in the future, online advertising for which the advertisement has yet to be displayed, microsoft dynamics business solutions products, xbox live subscriptions, mediaroom, and other offerings for which we have been paid upfront and earn the revenue when we provide the service or software, or otherwise meet the revenue recognition criteria.  \u00a0 \u00a0    table of

june\u00a030, 2009.  we have operating leases for most u.s. and international sales and support offices and certain equipment. rental expense for operating leases was $475 million, $398 million, and $325 million, in fiscal years 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively. future minimum rental commitments under noncancellable operating leases in place as of june\u00a030, 2009 are as follows:  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  table of contents  \u00a0part ii\u00a0  item 8  \u00a0 \u00a0 we provide indemnifications of varying scope and size to certain customers against claims of intellectual property infringement made by third parties arising from the use of our products and certain other matters. we evaluate estimated losses for these indemnifications under sfas no.\u00a05, accounting for contingencies, as interpreted by fin no.\u00a045, guarantor\u0092s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees, including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others. we consider such factors as the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss. to date, we have not encountered significant costs as a result of these obligations and have not accrued any liabilities related to these indemnifications in our financial statements.  product warranty  the changes in our aggregate product warranty liabilities, which are included in other current liabilities and other long term-liabilities on our balance sheets, were as follows:  \u00a0 note 17\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0contingencies  government competition law matters  in march\u00a02004, the european commission issued a competition law decision that, among other things, ordered us to license certain windows server protocol technology to our competitors. in march\u00a02007, the european commission issued a statement of objections claiming that the pricing terms we proposed for licensing the technology as required by\u00a0the march 2004 decision were \u0093not reasonable.\u0094 following additional steps we took to address these concerns, the commission announced on october\u00a022, 2007 that we were in compliance with the march 2004 decision and that no further penalty should accrue after that date. on february\u00a027, 2008, the commission issued a fine of $1.4 billion (\u0080899 million) relating to the period prior to october\u00a022, 2007. in may 2008, we filed an application with the european court of first instance to annul the february\u00a02008 fine. we paid the $1.4 billion (\u0080899 million) fine in june 2008.  in january 2008, the commission opened a competition law investigation relating to the inclusion of various capabilities in our windows operating system software, including web browsing software. the investigation was precipitated by a complaint filed with the commission by opera software asa, a firm that offers web browsing software. on january\u00a015, 2009, the european commission issued a statement of objections expressing the commission\u0092s preliminary view that the inclusion of internet explorer in windows since 1996 has violated european competition law. according to the statement of objections, other browsers are foreclosed from competing because windows includes internet explorer. we filed our written response to the statement of objections in late april 2009. the european commission will not make a final determination until after it assesses our response and considers submissions from others, a process that is now underway. the statement of objections\u00a0seeks to impose a remedy that is different than the remedy imposed in the earlier proceeding concerning windows media player. while computer users and oems are already free to run any web browsing software on windows, the commission is considering ordering other changes to further promote the prospects of competing browser software. this may include ordering creation of a \u0093ballot screen\u0094 from which computer users could choose from among a variety of browsers. the statement of objections also seeks to impose a significant fine based on worldwide sales of windows operating systems.\u00a0in january 2008, the commission opened an additional competition law investigation that relates primarily to interoperability with respect to our microsoft office family of products. this investigation resulted from complaints filed with the commission by a trade association of microsoft\u0092s competitors. on july 24, 2009 we submitted a proposal to the commission to resolve the investigation concerning internet explorer. under this proposal, european consumers who use internet explorer as their default browser would be shown a \u0093ballot screen\u0094 from which they could, if they wished, easily install competing browsers from the web. we also submitted a proposal regarding means   \u00a0 \u00a0    table of contents  \u00a0part ii\u00a0  item 8  \u00a0 \u00a0  of promoting greater interoperability between non-microsoft products and our windows and office families of products. we made this proposal following extensive discussions with the commission. in a statement issued on july 24, 2009, the commission stated it welcomes our proposals. we understand the commission will now consider them, which will likely entail seeking input from a range of industry participants.  we are subject to a consent decree and final judgment (\u0093final judgments\u0094) that resolved lawsuits brought by the u.s. department of justice, 18 states, and the district of columbia in two separate actions. the final judgments imposed various constraints on our windows operating system businesses. originally, the final judgments were scheduled to expire in november 2007. in 2006, we voluntarily agreed to extend certain elements of the final judgments to november 2009. the u.s. department of justice and other states advised the court that they would not seek any extension of the final judgments to which they are party. in january 2008, the court issued a decision granting the states\u0092 motion to extend these additional provisions of the final judgments until november 2009. on april\u00a016, 2009, we agreed with the department of justice and the states, respectively, to extend the final\u00a0judgments to may 2011, and submitted to the u.s. district court for the district of columbia joint motions for this extension. in april 2009, the court entered an order approving the extension.  in other ongoing investigations, various foreign governments and several state attorneys general have requested information from us concerning competition, privacy, and security issues.  antitrust, unfair competition, and overcharge class actions  a large number of antitrust and unfair competition class action lawsuits have been filed against us in various state, federal, and canadian courts on behalf of various classes of direct and indirect purchasers of our pc operating system and certain other software products. we obtained dismissals of damages claims of indirect purchasers under federal law and in 15 states. courts refused to certify classes in two additional states. we have reached agreements to settle all claims that have been made to date in 19 states and the district of columbia.  under the settlements, generally class members can obtain vouchers that entitle them to be reimbursed for purchases of a wide variety of platform-neutral computer hardware and software. the total value of vouchers that we may issue varies by state. we will make available to certain schools a percentage of those vouchers that are not issued or claimed (one-half to two-thirds depending on the state). the total value of vouchers we ultimately issue will depend on the number of class members who make claims and are issued vouchers. the maximum value of vouchers to be issued is approximately $2.7 billion. the actual costs of these settlements will be less than that maximum amount, depending on the number of class members and schools that are issued and redeem vouchers.  the settlements in all states except arizona have received final court approval. cases in canada have not been settled. we estimate the total cost to resolve all of the overcharge class action cases will range between $1.8 billion and $2.0 billion. the actual cost depends on factors such as the claim rate, the quantity and mix of products for which claims are made, the number of eligible class members who ultimately use the vouchers, the nature of hardware and software that is acquired using the vouchers, and the cost of administering the claims. at june\u00a030, 2009, we have recorded a liability related to these claims of approximately $800 million, which reflects our estimated exposure of $1.8 billion less payments made to date of approximately $1.0 billion mostly for vouchers, legal fees, and administrative expenses.  other antitrust litigation and claims  in november 2004, novell, inc. filed a complaint in u.s. district court, asserting antitrust and unfair competition claims against us related to novell\u0092s ownership of wordperfect and other productivity applications during the period between june 1994 and march 1996. this case was transferred to maryland. in june\u00a02005, the trial court granted our motion to dismiss four of nine claims of the complaint. both parties appealed, and in october 2007, the court of appeals affirmed the decision of the trial court, and remanded the case to that court for further proceedings. fact discovery has closed and summary judgment motions are expected to be filed in the fall.  patent and intellectual property claims  in 2003 we filed an action in u.s. district court in california seeking a declaratory judgment that we do not infringe certain alcatel-lucent patents (although this action began before the merger of alcatel and lucent in 2006, for simplicity we refer to the post-merger entity of alcatel-lucent). in april 2008, a jury returned a verdict in alcatel-lucent\u0092s favor in a trial on a consolidated group of one video and three user interface patents. the jury concluded that we had infringed two user interface patents and awarded\u00a0$367 million in damages. in june 2008, the trial judge increased the amount of damages to $512 million to include $145 million of interest.\u00a0we have appealed that award to the federal circuit.\u00a0in december 2008, we entered into a settlement agreement resolving all other litigation   \u00a0 \u00a0  table of contents  \u00a0part ii\u00a0  item 8  \u00a0 \u00a0  pending between microsoft and alcatel-lucent, leaving approximately $500 million remaining in dispute. in april 2009, the u.s. patent and trademark office, after a reexamination of the remaining patent in dispute, determined that the patent was invalid and alcatel-lucent has appealed that ruling.  in october 2003, uniloc usa inc., a subsidiary of a singapore-based security technology company, filed a patent infringement suit in u.s. district court in rhode island, claiming that product activation technology in windows xp and certain other microsoft programs violated a uniloc patent. after we obtained a favorable summary judgment that we did not infringe any of the claims of this patent, the court of appeals vacated the trial court decision and remanded the case for trial.\u00a0in april 2009, the jury returned a $388 million verdict against us, including a finding of willful infringement. we are seeking to overturn this verdict via post-trial motions and, if necessary, will appeal, based on evidence that our product activation technology does not infringe the patent, that the patent is invalid, and that the damages were unsupported. with pre-judgment interest, approximately $500 million is in dispute.  in march 2007, i4i limited partnership, based in canada, sued microsoft in u.s. district court in the eastern district of texas, claiming that certain custom xml technology in word 2003 and 2007 infringed i4i\u0092s patent. in may 2009, a jury returned a verdict against us, finding damages of $200 million and that we willfully infringed the patent. our defense of inequitable conduct has not yet been ruled upon, and we are also seeking to overturn the verdict via post-trial motions and, if necessary, via appeal. with pre-judgment interest, approximately $240 million is in dispute.  there are over 50 other patent infringement cases pending against microsoft, 10 of which are set for trial in fiscal year 2010.  other  we also are subject to a variety of other claims and suits that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of our business. although management currently believes that resolving claims against us, individually or in aggregate, will not have a material adverse impact on our financial position, our results of operations, or our cash flows, these matters are subject to inherent uncertainties and management\u0092s view of these matters may change in the future.  as of june\u00a030, 2009, we had accrued aggregate liabilities of approximately $800 million in other current liabilities and approximately $400 million in other long-term liabilities for all of the contingent matters described in this note. while we intend to vigorously defend these matters, there exists the possibility of adverse outcomes that we estimate could be up to $2.2 billion in aggregate beyond recorded amounts. the foregoing amount does not include the january\u00a015, 2009 european commission statement of objections, the outcome and range of which is not reasonably estimable. were unfavorable final outcomes to occur, there exists the possibility of a material adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows for the period in which the effects become reasonably estimable.  note 18\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0stockholders\u0092 equity  shares

that qualifies under section\u00a0401(k) of the internal revenue code, and a number of savings plans in international locations. participating u.s. employees may contribute up to 50% of their salary, but not more than statutory limits. we contribute fifty cents for each dollar a participant contributes in this plan, with a maximum contribution of 3% of a participant\u0092s earnings. matching contributions for all plans were $262 million, $238 million, and $218 million in fiscal years 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively, and were expensed as contributed. matching contributions are invested proportionate to each participant\u0092s voluntary contributions in the investment options provided under the plan. investment options in the u.s. plan include microsoft common stock, but neither participant nor our matching contributions are required to be invested in microsoft common stock.  stock plans  we have stock plans for directors and for officers, employees, consultants, and advisors. at june\u00a030, 2009, an aggregate of 714\u00a0million shares were authorized for future grant under our stock plans, which cover stock options, stock awards, and shared performance stock awards. awards that expire or are canceled without delivery of shares generally become available for issuance under the plans. we issue new shares to satisfy stock option exercises.  stock awards  stock awards (\u0093sas\u0094) are grants that entitle the holder to shares of microsoft common stock as the award vests. our sas generally vest over a five-year period.  shared performance stock awards  shared performance stock awards (\u0093spsas\u0094) are a form of sa in which the number of shares ultimately received depends on our business performance against specified performance targets.  the company granted spsas for fiscal years 2009, 2008, and 2007 with performance periods of july\u00a01, 2008 through june\u00a030, 2009,\u00a0july\u00a01, 2007 through june\u00a030, 2008, and july\u00a01, 2006 through june\u00a030, 2007, respectively. at the end of each performance period, the number of shares of stock subject to the award is determined by multiplying the target award by a percentage ranging from 0% to 150%. the percentage is based on performance metrics for the performance period, as determined by the compensation committee of the board of directors in its sole discretion. an additional number of shares, approximately 12.2% of the total target spsas, are available as additional awards to participants based on individual performance. one-quarter of the shares of stock subject to each award vest following the end of the performance period, and an additional one-quarter of the shares vest on each of the following three anniversaries of the grant date. following the end of the fiscal year 2008 and 2007 performance periods, the compensation committee of the board of directors determined that the number of shares of spsas to be issued were 18\u00a0million and 11\u00a0million respectively, based on the actual performance against metrics established for the performance period. the number of shares of spsas to be issued for the fiscal year 2009 performance period will be determined in the first quarter of fiscal year 2010.  \u00a0 \u00a0   table of contents  \u00a0part ii\u00a0  item 8  \u00a0 \u00a0 executive officer incentive plan  in fiscal year 2009, the compensation committee approved a new executive officer incentive plan (\u0093eoip\u0094) for executive officers of the company.\u00a0the eoip replaced the annual cash bonus opportunity and equity award plans for executive officers.\u00a0under the eoip, the compensation committee makes awards of performance-based compensation for specified performance periods.\u00a0for fiscal year 2009, executive officers were eligible to receive annual awards comprised of cash and sas from an incentive pool funded based on the achievement of operating income targets. following approval of the awards for fiscal year 2009, 20% of the award will be paid to the executive officers in cash, and the remaining 80% will be converted into an sa for shares of microsoft common stock. the sa portion of the award will vest one-quarter immediately after the award is approved following fiscal year 2009,\u00a0and one-quarter on august\u00a031 of each of the following three years.  the company will grant awards to the executive officers in september 2009 based on the performance period of july\u00a01, 2008 through june\u00a030, 2009, from an incentive pool equal to 0.35% of the company\u0092s fiscal year 2009 operating income.\u00a0each executive officer will receive a fixed percentage of the pool ranging between 0 and 150% of a target based on an assessment of the executive officer\u0092s performance during fiscal year 2009. the number of shares subject to the sa portion of the award will be determined by dividing the value of the award by the closing price of microsoft common stock on august\u00a031, 2009.  activity for all stock plans  we measure the fair value of sas and spsas based upon the market price of the underlying common stock as of the date of grant, reduced by the present value of estimated future dividends. sas and spsas eoip are amortized over their applicable vesting period (generally four to five years) using the straight-line method. the fair value of each award grant is estimated on the date of grant using the following assumptions:  \u00a0 during fiscal year 2009, the following activity occurred under our existing plans:  \u00a0 as of june\u00a030, 2009, there was $3.8 billion and $551 million of total unrecognized compensation costs related to sas and spsas, respectively. these costs are expected to be recognized over a

activity occurred under our plans:  \u00a0 stock options  in fiscal year 2004, we began granting employees sas rather than stock options as part of our equity compensation plans. since then, stock options issued to employees have been issued primarily in conjunction with business acquisitions. nonqualified stock options were granted to our directors under our non-employee director stock plan until 2004 when we began granting directors sas. nonqualified and incentive stock options were granted to certain officers and employees under our employee stock plans. options granted between 1995 and 2001 generally vest over four and one-half years and expire seven years from the date of grant, while certain options vest either over four and one-half years or over seven and one-half years and expire 10 years from the date of grant. options granted after 2001 vest over four and one-half years and expire 10 years from the date of grant. we granted one million, 10\u00a0million, and two million stock options, respectively, in conjunction with business acquisitions during fiscal years 2009, 2008, and 2007.  employee stock options outstanding were as follows:  \u00a0 options outstanding as of june\u00a030, 2009 include approximately eight\u00a0million options that were granted in conjunction with business acquisitions. while these options are included in the options outstanding balance, they are excluded from the weighted average exercise price. these options have an exercise price range of $0.01 to $150.93 and a weighted average exercise price of $9.50.  during fiscal years 2009, 2008, and 2007, the following activity occurred under our plans:  \u00a0 cash received and income tax benefits from stock option exercises were $88 million and $12 million,

implemented a resource management program to reduce discretionary operating expenses, employee headcount, and capital expenditures. as part of this program, we announced the elimination of up to 5,000 positions in research and development, marketing, sales, finance, legal, human resources, and information technology by june\u00a030, 2010.  during the fiscal year ended june\u00a030, 2009, we recorded charges of $330 million for the expected reduction in employee headcount which was recorded as corporate-level activity. during the year we had a net reduction of approximately 4,400

of an enterprise and related information, establishes standards for reporting information about operating segments. this standard requires segmentation based on our internal organization and reporting of revenue and operating income (loss) based upon internal accounting methods. our financial reporting systems present various data for management to operate the business, including internal profit and loss statements prepared on a basis not consistent with u.s. gaap. the segments are designed to allocate resources internally and provide a framework to determine management responsibility. amounts for prior periods have been recast to conform to the current management view. operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise about which separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker, or decision making group, in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance. our chief operating decision maker is our chief executive officer. our five segments are client; server and tools; online services business; microsoft business division; and entertainment and devices division.  the types of products and services provided by each segment are summarized below:  client \u0096 windows vista, including home basic, home premium, ultimate, business, enterprise and starter edition; windows xp, including professional, home, media center, and tablet pc edition; and other standard windows operating systems.  server and tools \u0096 windows server operating system; microsoft sql server; visual studio; silverlight; system center products; forefront security products; biz talk server; microsoft consulting services; premier product support services; and other products and services.  online services business \u0096 bing; microsoft adcenter/adexpert; microsoft media network (mmn); msn portals, channels, and mobile services; windows live suite of applications and mobile services; atlas online tools for advertisers and publishers; msn premium web services (consisting of msn internet software subscription, msn hotmail plus, and msn software services); and razorfish media agency services.  microsoft business division \u0096 microsoft office; microsoft office project; microsoft office visio; microsoft office sharepoint server; fast esp; microsoft exchange server; microsoft exchange hosted services; microsoft office live meeting; microsoft office communications server; microsoft office communicator; microsoft tellme service; microsoft dynamics erp products including ax, nav, gp, sl, retail management system, and point of sale; microsoft dynamics crm; and microsoft dynamics crm online.  entertainment and devices division \u0096 xbox 360 console and games; xbox live; zune; mediaroom; numerous consumer software and hardware products (such as mice and keyboards); windows mobile software and services platform; windows embedded device operating system; windows automotive; and the microsoft surface computing platform.  because of our integrated business structure, operating costs included in one segment may benefit other segments, and therefore these segments are not designed to measure operating income or loss directly related to the products included in each segment. inter-segment cost commissions are estimated by management and used to compensate or charge each segment for such shared costs and to incent shared efforts. management will continually evaluate the alignment of product development organizations, sales organizations, and inter-segment commissions for segment reporting purposes, which may result in changes to segment allocations in future periods.  assets are not allocated to segments for internal reporting presentations. a portion of amortization and depreciation is included with various other costs in an overhead allocation to each segment and it is impracticable for us to separately identify the amount of amortization and depreciation by segment that is included in the measure of segment profit or loss.  reconciling amounts include adjustments to conform with u.s. gaap and corporate-level activity not specifically attributed to a segment. significant internal accounting policies that differ from u.s. gaap relate to revenue recognition, income statement classification, and accelerated amortization for depreciation, stock awards, and performance-based stock awards. in addition, certain revenue and expenses are excluded from segments or included in corporate-level activity including certain legal settlements and accruals for legal contingencies.  \u00a0 \u00a0  table of contents  \u00a0part ii\u00a0  item 8  \u00a0 \u00a0 note 23\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0quarterly information

algorithmic and paid search platform for yahoo! web sites. as part of the transaction, microsoft will compensate yahoo! through a revenue sharing agreement on traffic generated on the yahoo! network owned and operated sites, and a guarantee of search revenue in certain countries. additionally, yahoo! will become the exclusive worldwide relationship sales force for both companies\u0092 premium search advertisers. self-serve advertising for both companies will be fulfilled by microsoft\u0092s adcenter platform, and prices for all search ads will continue to be set by adcenter\u0092s automated auction process. microsoft will also acquire an exclusive 10-year license to yahoo!\u0092s core search technology and will have the ability to integrate yahoo! search technology into its existing web search platform.  the agreement does not cover either company\u0092s web properties and products, email, instant messaging, display advertising, or any other aspect of the companies\u0092 businesses, and the companies will continue to compete in those areas. the transaction will be subject to regulatory review. the agreement entered into on july 29 anticipates that the parties will enter into more detailed definitive agreements prior to closing the transaction. the companies are hopeful that closing can occur in early calendar year 2010.  \u00a0 \u00a0  table of contents

includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.\u00a0an audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. we believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.  in our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of microsoft corporation and subsidiaries as of june\u00a030, 2009 and 2008, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended june\u00a030, 2009, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america.  as

management on internal control over financial reporting  our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for the company. internal control over financial reporting is a process to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america. internal control over financial reporting includes maintaining records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect our transactions; providing reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary for preparation of our financial statements; providing reasonable assurance that receipts and expenditures of company assets are made in accordance with management authorization; and providing reasonable assurance that unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of company assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements would be prevented or detected on a timely basis. because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting is not intended to provide absolute assurance that a misstatement of our financial statements would be prevented or detected.  management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in internal control \u0096 integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission. based on this evaluation, management concluded that the company\u0092s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of june\u00a030, 2009. there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended june\u00a030, 2009 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. deloitte\u00a0& touche llp has audited our internal

corporation and subsidiaries (the \u0093company\u0094) as of june\u00a030, 2009, based on criteria established in internal control-integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission.\u00a0the company\u0092s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying report of management on internal control over financial reporting.\u00a0our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company\u0092s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.  we conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board (united states).\u00a0those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\u00a0our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.\u00a0we believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.  a company\u0092s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company\u0092s principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the company\u0092s board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.\u00a0a company\u0092s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1)\u00a0pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2)\u00a0provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3)\u00a0provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company\u0092s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.  because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.\u00a0also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.  in our opinion, the company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of june\u00a030, 2009, based on the criteria established in internal control\u0096integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission.  we have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the public company

i\u00a0  item 1a  \u00a0 \u00a0 another development is the business model under which companies provide content, and software in the form of applications, data, and related services, over the internet in exchange for revenues primarily from advertising or subscriptions. an example of an advertising-funded business model is internet search, where providing a robust alternative is particularly important and challenging due to the scale effects enjoyed by a single market dominant competitor. advances in computing and communications technologies have made this model viable and enabled the rapid growth of some of our competitors. we are devoting significant resources toward developing our own competing software plus services strategies. it is uncertain whether these strategies will be successful.  an important element of our business model has been to create platform-based ecosystems on which many participants can build diverse solutions. a competing vertically-integrated model, in which a single firm controls both the software and hardware elements of a product, has been successful with certain consumer products such as personal computers, mobile phones and digital music players. we also offer vertically-integrated hardware and software products; however, efforts to compete with the vertically integrated model may increase our cost of sales and reduce operating margins.  we face intense competition.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0we continue to experience intense competition across all markets for our products and services. our competitors range in size from fortune 100 companies to small, specialized single-product businesses and open source community-based projects. although we believe the breadth of our businesses and product portfolio is a competitive advantage, our competitors that are focused on narrower product lines may be more effective in devoting technical, marketing, and financial resources to compete with us. in addition, barriers to entry in our businesses generally are low and products, once developed, can be distributed broadly and quickly at relatively low cost. open source software vendors are devoting considerable efforts to developing software that mimics the features and functionality of our products, in some cases on the basis of technical specifications for microsoft technologies that we make available. in response to competition, we are developing versions of our products with basic functionality that are sold at lower prices than the standard versions. these competitive pressures may result in decreased sales volumes, price reductions, and/or increased operating costs, such as for marketing and sales incentives, resulting in lower revenue, gross margins and operating income.  we may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property rights.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0protecting our global intellectual property rights and combating unlicensed copying and use of software and other intellectual property is difficult. while piracy adversely affects u.s. revenue, the impact on revenue from outside the u.s. is more significant, particularly in countries where laws are less protective of intellectual property rights. similarly, the absence of harmonized patent laws makes it more difficult to ensure consistent respect for patent rights. throughout the world, we actively educate consumers about the benefits of licensing genuine products and obtaining indemnification benefits for intellectual property risks, and we educate lawmakers about the advantages of a business climate where intellectual property rights are protected. however, continued educational and enforcement efforts may fail to enhance revenue. reductions in the legal protection for software intellectual property rights could adversely affect revenue.  third parties may claim we infringe their intellectual property rights.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0from time to time we receive notices from others claiming we infringe their intellectual property rights. the number of these claims may grow. to resolve these claims we may enter into royalty and licensing agreements on less favorable terms, stop selling or redesign affected products, or pay damages to satisfy indemnification commitments with our customers. such agreements may cause operating margins to decline. we have made and expect to continue making significant expenditures to settle claims related to the use of technology and intellectual property rights as part of our strategy to manage this risk.  we may not be able to protect our source code from copying if there is an unauthorized disclosure of source code.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0source code, the detailed program commands for our operating systems and other software programs, is critical to our business. although we license portions of our application and operating system source code to a number of licensees, we take significant measures to protect the secrecy of large portions of our source code. if an unauthorized disclosure of a significant portion of our source code occurs, we could potentially lose future trade secret protection for that source code. this could make it easier for third parties to compete with our products by copying functionality, which could adversely affect our revenue and operating margins. unauthorized disclosure of source code also could increase the security risks described in the next paragraph.  \u00a0 \u00a0    table of contents  \u00a0part i\u00a0  item 1a  \u00a0 \u00a0 security vulnerabilities in our products could lead to reduced revenues or to liability claims.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0maintaining the security of computers and computer networks is a critical issue for us and our customers. hackers develop and deploy viruses, worms, and other malicious software programs that attack our products. although this is an industry- wide problem that affects computers across all platforms, it affects our products in particular because hackers tend to focus their efforts on the most popular operating systems and programs and we expect them to continue to do so. we devote significant resources to address security vulnerabilities through:  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 the cost of these steps could reduce our operating margins. despite these efforts, actual or perceived security vulnerabilities in our products could lead some customers to seek to return products, to reduce or delay future purchases, or to use competing products. customers may also increase their expenditures on protecting their existing computer systems from attack, which could delay adoption of new technologies. any of these actions by customers could adversely affect our revenue. in addition, actual or perceived vulnerabilities may lead to claims against us. although our license agreements typically contain provisions that eliminate or limit our exposure to such liability, there is no assurance these provisions will withstand all legal challenges.  we are subject to government litigation and regulatory activity that affects how we design and market our products.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0as a leading global software maker, we receive close scrutiny from government agencies under u.s. and foreign competition laws. some jurisdictions also provide private rights of action for competitors or consumers to assert claims of anti-competitive conduct. for example, we have been involved in the following actions.  lawsuits brought by the u.s. department of justice, 18 states, and the district of columbia in two separate actions were resolved through a consent decree that took effect in 2001 and a final judgment entered in 2002. these proceedings imposed various constraints on our windows operating system businesses. these constraints include limits on certain contracting practices, mandated disclosure of certain software program interfaces and protocols, and rights for computer manufacturers to limit the visibility of certain windows features in new pcs. we believe we are in full compliance with these rules. however, if we fail to comply with them, additional restrictions could be imposed on us that would adversely affect our business.  the european commission closely scrutinizes the design of high-volume microsoft products and the terms on which we make certain technologies used in these products, such as file formats, programming interfaces, and protocols, available to other companies. in 2004, the commission ordered us to create new versions of windows that do not include certain multimedia technologies and to provide our competitors with specifications for how to implement certain proprietary windows communications protocols in their own products. the commission\u0092s impact on product design may limit our ability to innovate in windows or other products in the future, diminish the developer appeal of the windows platform, and increase our product development costs. the availability of licenses related to protocols and file formats may enable competitors to develop software products that better mimic the functionality of our own products which could result in decreased sales of our\u00a0products.  government regulatory actions and court decisions may hinder our ability to provide the benefits of our software to consumers and businesses, thereby reducing the attractiveness of our products and the revenues that come from them. new actions could be initiated at any time, either by these or other governments or private claimants, including with respect to new versions of windows or other microsoft products. the outcome of such actions, or steps taken to avoid them, could adversely affect us in a variety of ways, including:  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  table of contents  \u00a0part i\u00a0  item 1a  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 our software and services online offerings are subject to government regulation of the internet domestically and internationally in many areas, including user privacy, telecommunications, data protection, and online content. the application of these laws and regulations to our business is often unclear and sometimes may conflict. compliance with these regulations may involve significant costs or require changes in business practices that result in reduced revenue. noncompliance could result in penalties being imposed on us or orders that we stop doing the alleged noncompliant activity.  our business depends on our ability to attract and retain talented employees.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0our business is based on successfully attracting and retaining talented employees. the market for highly skilled workers and leaders in our industry is extremely competitive. we are limited in our ability to recruit internationally by restrictive domestic immigration laws. if we are less successful in our recruiting efforts, or if we are unable to retain key employees, our ability to develop and deliver successful products and services may be adversely affected. effective succession planning is also important to our long-term success. failure to ensure effective transfer of knowledge and smooth transitions involving key employees could hinder our strategic planning and execution.  delays in product development schedules may adversely affect our revenues.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0the development of software products is a complex and time-consuming process. new products and enhancements to existing products can require long development and testing periods. our increasing focus on software plus services also presents new and complex development issues. significant delays in new product or service releases or significant problems in creating new products or services could adversely affect our revenue.  we make significant investments in new products and services that may not be profitable.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0we have made and will continue to make significant investments in research, development, and marketing for new products, services, and technologies, including windows vista, the 2007 microsoft office system, xbox 360, live search, windows server, zune, and windows live. investments in new technology are speculative. commercial success depends on many factors, including innovativeness, developer support, and effective distribution and marketing. we may not achieve significant revenue from new product and service investments for a number of years, if at all. moreover, new products and services may not be profitable, and even if they are profitable, operating margins for new products and businesses may not be as high as the margins we have experienced historically.  adverse economic conditions may harm our business.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0inflation, softness in corporate information technology spending, or other changes in economic conditions that affect demand for computer hardware or software could adversely affect our revenue or our investment portfolio. if demand for pcs, servers, and other computing devices declines significantly, or consumer or corporate spending for such products declines, our revenue will be adversely affected. in addition, our revenue may be unfavorably impacted if customers reduce their purchases of new software products or upgrades because new offerings such as windows vista and the 2007 microsoft office system are not perceived as providing significant new functionality or other value to prospective purchasers.  we have claims and lawsuits against us that may result in adverse outcomes.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0we are subject to a variety of claims and lawsuits. adverse outcomes in some or all of these claims may result in significant monetary damages or injunctive relief that could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business. although management currently believes resolving all of these matters, individually or in the aggregate, will not have a material adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows, the litigation and other claims are subject to inherent uncertainties and management\u0092s view of these matters may change in the future. a material adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows also could occur for the period in which the effect of an unfavorable final outcome becomes probable and reasonably estimable.  we may have additional tax liabilities.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0we are subject to income taxes in the united states and many foreign jurisdictions. significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes. in the ordinary course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is   \u00a0 \u00a0    table of contents  \u00a0part i\u00a0  item 1a  \u00a0 \u00a0  uncertain. we regularly are under audit by tax authorities. although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals. the results of an audit or litigation could have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows in the period or periods for which that determination is made.  our vertically-integrated hardware and software products may experience quality or supply problems.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0our hardware products such as the xbox 360 console are highly complex and can have defects in design, manufacture, or associated software. we could incur significant expenses, lost revenue, and reputational harm if we fail to detect or effectively address such issues through design, testing, or warranty repairs. we obtain some components of our hardware devices from sole suppliers. if a component delivery from a sole-source supplier is delayed or becomes unavailable or industry shortages occur, we may be unable to obtain timely replacement supplies, resulting in reduced sales. either component shortages or excess or obsolete inventory may require us to record charges to cost of revenue. xbox 360 consoles are assembled in asia; disruptions in the supply chain may result in console shortages that would affect our revenues and operating margins. these same risks would apply to any other vertically-integrated hardware and software products we may offer.  if our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets become impaired we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0under generally accepted accounting principles, we review our amortizable intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually. factors that may be considered a change in circumstances, indicating that the carrying value of our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets may not be recoverable, include a decline in stock price and market capitalization, reduced future cash flow estimates, and slower growth rates in our industry. we may be required to record a significant charge in our financial statements during the period in which any impairment of our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets is determined, negatively impacting our results of operations.  we operate a global business that exposes us to additional risks.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0we operate in over 100 countries and a significant part of our revenue comes from international sales. pressure to make our pricing structure uniform might require that we reduce the sales price of our software in the united states and other countries. operations outside the united states may be affected by changes in trade protection laws, policies and measures, and other regulatory requirements affecting trade and investment; changes in regulatory requirements for software; social, political, labor or economic conditions in a specific country or region; and difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations. although we hedge a portion of our international currency exposure, significant fluctuations in exchange rates between the u.s. dollar and foreign currencies may adversely affect our net revenues.  catastrophic events or geo-political conditions may disrupt our business.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0a disruption or failure of our systems or operations in the event of a major earthquake, weather event, cyber-attack, terrorist attack, or other catastrophic event could cause delays in completing sales, providing services or performing other mission-critical functions. our corporate headquarters, a significant portion of our research and development activities, and certain other critical business operations are located in the seattle, washington area, and we have other business operations in the silicon valley area of california, both of which are near major earthquake faults. a catastrophic event that results in the destruction or disruption of any of our critical business or information technology systems could harm our ability to conduct normal business operations and our operating results. abrupt political change, terrorist activity, and armed conflict pose a risk of general economic disruption in affected countries, which may increase our operating costs. these conditions also may add uncertainty to the timing and budget for technology investment decisions by our customers.  acquisitions and joint ventures may have an adverse effect on our business.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0we expect to continue making acquisitions or entering into joint ventures as part of our long-term business strategy. these transactions involve significant challenges and risks including that the transaction does not advance our business strategy, that we don\u0092t realize a satisfactory return on our investment, or that we experience difficulty in the integration of new employees, business systems, and technology, or diversion of management\u0092s attention from our other businesses. these events could harm our operating results or financial condition.  \u00a0 \u00a0  table of contents  \u00a0part ii\u00a0  item 7  \u00a0 \u00a0 key market opportunities include:  consumer technology.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0we are focused on delivering consumer software products that we believe are compelling in terms of design, features, and functionality. we also are working to define the next era of consumer electronics through the development of innovative software that runs on a wide range of devices and connects people quickly and easily to the information, experiences, and communities they care about.  software plus services.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0the ability to combine the power of desktop and server software with the reach of the internet represents an opportunity across every one of our businesses. we believe our software plus services approach will enable us to deliver new experiences to end users and new value to businesses.  expanding our presence on the desktop, the server, and with developers.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0through our ability to deliver additional value in security, messaging, systems management, and collaboration, and new technology for high-performance computing, unified communications, and business intelligence, we believe we are well-positioned to build on our strength with businesses of all sizes and with developers. fiscal year 2008 saw widespread adoption of windows vista and the 2007 microsoft office system and the launch of windows server 2008, sql server 2008, and visual studio 2008.  summary of results for fiscal years 2008, 2007, and 2006  \u00a0 fiscal year 2008 compared with fiscal year 2007  revenue growth was driven primarily by increased licensing of the 2007 microsoft office system, increased xbox 360 platform sales, increased revenue associated with windows server and sql server, and increased licensing of windows vista. foreign currency exchange rates accounted for a $1.6 billion or three percentage point increase in revenue during the year.  operating income increased primarily reflecting increased revenue, partially offset by increased headcount-related expenses, increased costs for legal settlements and legal contingencies, and increased cost of revenue. headcount-related expenses increased 12%, reflecting an increase in headcount during the year. we incurred $1.8 billion of legal charges during the year primarily related to the european commission fine of $1.4 billion (\u0080899 million) as compared with $511 million of legal charges during the prior year. cost of revenue increased $905 million or 8%, reflecting increased data center and equipment costs, online content expenses, and increased costs associated with the growth in our consulting services, partially offset by decreased xbox 360 costs. the decreased xbox 360 costs reflect the $1.1 billion charge in fiscal year 2007 related to the expansion of our xbox 360 warranty coverage as discussed below, partially offset by increased xbox 360 product costs reflecting growth in unit console sales.  the diluted earnings per share growth was impacted by the $1.1 billion xbox 360 charge in fiscal year 2007 and current year share repurchases.  fiscal year 2007 compared with fiscal year 2006  revenue growth was driven primarily by licensing of the 2007 microsoft office system and windows vista, increased revenue associated with sql server, windows server, and visual studio, and increased xbox 360 platform sales. foreign currency exchange rates did not have a significant impact on consolidated revenue during the year.  operating income growth was driven primarily by increased revenue and decreased costs for legal settlements and legal contingencies, partially offset by increased cost of revenue associated with xbox 360 and windows vista, increased osb data centers costs, and increased sales and marketing expenses. in july 2007, we expanded our global xbox 360 warranty coverage to three years from the date of purchase for a general hardware failure indicated by three flashing red lights. as a result, we recorded a $1.1 billion charge in fiscal year 2007 for anticipated costs under the warranty policy, inventory write-downs, and product returns. the increase in sales and marketing expenses   \u00a0 \u00a0  table of contents  \u00a0part ii\u00a0  item 7  \u00a0 \u00a0  was primarily driven by increased headcount-related expenses and marketing costs related to product launches. headcount-related expenses increased 18%, driven by an increase in headcount during the year.  fiscal year 2009 outlook  global macroeconomic factors have a strong correlation to demand for our software, services, hardware, and online offerings. in fiscal year 2009, we expect a broad continuation of the economic conditions and demand we experienced during the latter part of fiscal year 2008. in fiscal year 2009, we expect double digit revenue growth and we estimate pc shipments will grow between 12% and 14%. within the overall pc market, we expect current trends to continue with consumer segment growth exceeding that of the business segment and emerging market growth exceeding that of mature markets.  segment product revenue/operating income (loss)  the revenue and operating income (loss) amounts in this section are presented on a basis consistent with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles (\u0093gaap\u0094) and include certain reconciling items attributable to each of the segments. the segment information appearing in note 19 \u0096 segment information of the notes to financial statements (part ii, item\u00a08) is presented on a basis consistent with the company\u0092s internal management reporting, in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards (\u0093sfas\u0094) no.\u00a0131, disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information. certain corporate-level activity has been excluded from our segment operating results and is presented separately. prior period amounts have been recast to conform to the way we internally manage and monitor performance at the segment level during the current period.  client  \u00a0 client offerings consist of premium and standard edition windows operating systems. premium editions are those that include additional functionality and are sold at a price above our standard editions. premium editions include windows vista business, windows vista home premium, windows vista ultimate, windows vista enterprise, windows xp professional, windows xp media center edition, and windows xp tablet pc edition. standard editions include windows vista home basic and windows xp home. client revenue growth generally correlates with the growth of pc purchases from oems that pre-install versions of windows operating systems because the oem channel accounts for over 80% of total client revenue. the differences between unit growth rates and revenue growth rates from year to year are affected by changes in the mix of oem windows operating systems licensed with premium edition operating systems as a percentage of total oem windows operating systems licensed (\u0093oem premium mix\u0094), changes in the geographical mix, and changes in the channel mix of products sold by large, multi-national oems versus those sold by local and regional system builders.  fiscal year 2008 compared with fiscal year 2007  client revenue increased reflecting growth in licensing of windows vista. by the end of fiscal year 2008, more than 180\u00a0million windows vista licenses had been sold (approximately 130\u00a0million were sold during fiscal year 2008) and millions of enterprise seats had been deployed. oem revenue increased $1.7 billion or 13%, driven by 16% growth in oem license units. revenue from commercial and retail licensing of windows operating systems increased $209 million or 8%, primarily from enterprise agreements and anti-piracy efforts in emerging markets. during the year, the oem premium mix increased seven percentage points to 74%, reflecting strong demand for windows vista home premium. based on our estimates, total worldwide pc shipments from all sources grew approximately 12% to 14%, driven by demand in both emerging and mature markets.  \u00a0 \u00a0    table of contents  \u00a0part ii\u00a0  item 7  \u00a0 \u00a0 client operating income increased reflecting increased revenue, partially offset by increased sales and marketing expenses and cost of revenue. sales and marketing expenses increased $149 million or 10%, primarily reflecting increased expenses associated with our corporate sales force. cost of revenue increased $115 million or 13%, primarily driven by windows vista product costs.  fiscal year 2007 compared with fiscal year 2006  client revenue increased primarily reflecting licensing of windows vista. oem revenue increased $1.4 billion or 13% driven by 13% growth in oem license units while revenue from commercial and retail licensing of windows operating systems increased $447 million or 22%. during the year, the oem premium mix increased 15 percentage points to 67%. we estimate total worldwide pc shipments from all sources grew 10% to 12% driven by demand in both emerging and mature markets.  client operating income increased reflecting the increased revenue and decreased research and development costs, partially offset by increased windows vista product costs and sales and marketing expenses for launch-related programs. the decrease in research and development expenses reflected the capitalization of certain windows vista software development costs and completion of product development on windows vista. headcount-related expenses decreased 7%, primarily driven by a decrease in headcount during the year.  fiscal year 2009 outlook  we expect pc market growth will exceed client revenue growth. we believe pc unit growth rates will be higher in the consumer segment than in the business segment and higher in emerging markets than in mature markets.  server and tools  \u00a0 server and tools concentrates on licensing products, applications, tools, content, and services that make information technology professionals and developers more productive and efficient. server and tools offerings consist of server software licenses and client access licenses

services, and microsoft consulting services. server products can be run on-site, in a hosted environment, or in a web-based environment. we use multiple channels for licensing, including pre-installed oem versions, licenses through partners, and licenses directly to end customers. we sell licenses both as one-time licenses and as multi-year volume licenses.  fiscal year 2008 compared with fiscal year 2007  server and tools revenue increased reflecting growth in product and services revenue and included a favorable impact from foreign currency exchange rates of $464 million or four percentage points. server and server application revenue (including cal revenue) and developer tools revenue increased $1.4 billion or 15%, primarily driven by growth in volume licensing of windows server and sql server products. this growth reflects broad adoption of the windows platform and applications with the releases of windows server 2008 and visual studio 2008 during the fiscal year. consulting and premier and professional product support services revenue increased $593 million or 29%, primarily due to higher demand for consulting and support services by corporate enterprises.  server and tools operating income increased primarily due to growth in high-margin product revenue, partially offset by increased sales and marketing expenses, cost of revenue, and research and development expenses. sales and marketing expenses increased $475 million or 14%, due to higher expenses associated with our corporate sales force. cost of revenue increased $394 million or 18%, reflecting the growth in

server, windows server, and visual studio. the results reflect broad adoption of windows server products, especially sql server which grew over 20%. consulting and premier and professional product support services revenue increased $428 million or 26%, primarily due to higher demand for premier services by corporate enterprises.  server and tools operating income increased reflecting the increased revenue, partially offset by growth in headcount-related expenses and cost of revenue for services. headcount-related expenses increased 14%, driven by an increase in headcount during the year. cost of revenue increased $260 million or 14%, reflecting growth in consulting and premier and professional product support services.  fiscal year 2009 outlook  we expect continued growth in both product and services revenue driven by strong customer demand for the recently released windows server 2008 and visual studio 2008 and upcoming release of sql server 2008.  online services business  \u00a0 online services business (\u0093osb\u0094) consists of an on-line advertising platform with offerings for both publishers and advertisers, personal communications services such as email and instant messaging, online information offerings such as live search, and the msn portals and channels around the world. we earn revenue primarily from online advertising, including search, display, and email and messaging services. revenue is also generated through subscriptions and transactions generated from online paid services, from advertiser and publisher tools, digital marketing and advertising agency services, and from msn narrowband internet access subscribers. we continue to launch new online offerings and expect to do so in the future. during fiscal year 2008, we launched new releases of windows live search, the windows live suite of applications and services, and updated our msn video service. in addition, we launched a new release of adcenter and expanded our advertising platform portfolio.  during the first quarter of fiscal year 2008, we completed our acquisition of aquantive, inc. (\u0093aquantive\u0094), a digital marketing business which we expect will play a key role in the development of our advertising business. aquantive earns revenue from online advertising and from digital marketing and advertising agency services. we believe the acquisition will help us build and support next-generation advertiser and publisher solutions in environments such as cross-media planning, video-on-demand, and internet protocol television. aquantive was consolidated into our results of operations starting august\u00a010, 2007, the acquisition date.  proposed acquisition of yahoo! inc.  to accelerate our advertising strategy, during fiscal year 2008 we submitted a proposal to the yahoo! inc. board of directors to acquire all of the outstanding shares of yahoo!.\u00a0after careful consideration, we determined that the price demanded by yahoo! was not in the best interest of our shareholders and we withdrew our proposal to acquire the   \u00a0    table of contents  \u00a0part ii\u00a0  item 7  \u00a0 \u00a0  company. subsequently, we submitted several proposals to purchase yahoo!\u0092s search business and make an investment in yahoo!, all of which were rejected by yahoo!.\u00a0we continue to invest heavily in new tools, web experiences, improved search performance, and advertiser satisfaction, and we will continue to seek to build our scale through organic growth, partnerships, and strategic acquisitions.  fiscal year 2008 compared with fiscal year 2007  osb revenue increased driven by increased online advertising revenue and the inclusion of aquantive revenue, partially offset by decreased access revenue. online advertising revenue increased $553 million or 31%, to $2.3 billion. this increase reflects growth in our existing online advertising business and includes aquantive online advertising revenue of $161 million. agency revenue, which is solely derived from aquantive, was $345 million during the year. access revenue decreased $98 million or 28%, to $256 million, reflecting migration of subscribers to broadband or other competitively-priced service providers. as of june\u00a030, 2008, we estimate we had approximately 460\u00a0million windows live ids compared with 382\u00a0million as of the same date last year.  osb operating loss increased driven by increased cost of revenue and other operating expenses, partially offset by increased revenue. cost of revenue increased $796 million or 71%, primarily driven by increased data center and equipment costs, online content expenses, and aquantive-related expenses. sales and marketing expenses increased $300 million or 35%, primarily due to increased amortization of customer-related intangible assets of $94 million, increased headcount-related expenses, and increased marketing costs. research and development expenses increased $177 million or 18%, and general and administrative expenses increased $117 million or 175%, primarily reflecting increased headcount-related expenses and merger and acquisition-related expenses. headcount-related expenses increased 24%, driven by an increase in headcount during the year.  fiscal year 2007 compared with fiscal year 2006  osb revenue increased driven primarily by advertising revenue which grew $283 million or 19%, to $1.8 billion. this increase was primarily due to growth in advertising for search, home page, email, and messaging services. the increase in advertising revenue was partially offset by a $156 million or 31% decrease in access revenue.  osb operating loss increased driven primarily by increased cost of revenue which grew $336 million or 42%, and increased headcount-related expenses as a result of continued search and advertising platform investments. the increase in cost of revenue was primarily driven by increased data center costs, online content expenses, and royalties. headcount-related expenses increased 31%, driven by an increase in headcount during the year.  fiscal year 2009 outlook  we expect revenue, including advertising revenue, to increase in fiscal year 2009 as we begin to see returns from investments we have made, including our acquisition of aquantive. we also expect operating expenses to increase as we continue to invest in our long-term strategy.  microsoft business division  \u00a0 microsoft business

table of contents  \u00a0part ii\u00a0  item 7  \u00a0 \u00a0 investment income and other  the components of investment income and other were as follows:  \u00a0 fiscal year 2008 compared with fiscal year 2007  dividends and interest income decreased reflecting lower interest rates on our fixed-income investments and a reduction in the average balance of interest-bearing investments owned. net recognized gains on investments, which include other-than-temporary impairments of $312 million during fiscal year 2008 and $25 million during fiscal year 2007, decreased primarily due to declines in equity values as a result of the recent stock market decline. net gains on derivatives increased primarily due to higher net gains on equity, commodity, and interest rate derivatives. other of $138 million includes the correction of several immaterial items from prior periods.  fiscal year 2007 compared with fiscal year 2006  dividends and interest income declined reflecting a decline in the average balance of dividend and interest-bearing investments owned, partly offset by higher interest rates received on our fixed-income investments. net recognized gains on investments, which include other-than-temporary impairments of $25 million during fiscal year 2007 and $408 million in fiscal year 2006, increased primarily due to lower other-than-temporary impairments and gains on sales of fixed-income investments as compared to losses in fiscal year 2006, partly offset by fewer gains on the sale of equity investments. derivative losses were primarily driven by net losses in time value on foreign currency contracts used to hedge anticipated foreign currency revenues. other in fiscal year 2006 includes $195 million of gains that resulted from the restructuring of joint venture relationships between microsoft and nbc related to msnbc cable l.l.c. and msnbc interactive news, l.l.c.  investments are considered to be impaired when a decline in fair value is judged to be other-than-temporary. we employ a systematic methodology that considers available evidence in evaluating potential impairment of our investments. if the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value, among other factors, we evaluate general market conditions, the duration and extent to which the fair value is less than cost, and our intent and ability to hold the investment. we also consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of and business outlook for the investee, including industry and sector performance, changes in technology, operational and financing cash flow factors, and rating agency actions. once a decline in fair value is determined to be other-than-temporary, an impairment charge is recorded and a new cost basis in the investment is established.  we lend certain fixed-income and equity securities to increase investment returns. the loaned securities continue to be carried as investments on our balance sheet. collateral and/or security interest is determined based upon the underlying security and the creditworthiness of the borrower. cash collateral is recorded as an asset with a corresponding liability.  we use derivative instruments to manage exposures to interest rates, equity prices, and foreign currency markets and to facilitate portfolio diversification. gains and losses arising from derivatives not designated as accounting hedges are in large part economically offset by unrealized losses and gains, respectively, in the underlying securities which are recorded as a component of other comprehensive income.  \u00a0 \u00a0    table of contents  \u00a0part ii\u00a0  item 7  \u00a0 \u00a0 income taxes  our effective tax rates for fiscal years 2008, 2007, and 2006 were 26%, 30%, and 31%, respectively. our effective tax rates are less than the statutory tax rate due to foreign earnings taxed at lower rates. the decreased rate in fiscal year 2008 resulted from resolution of tax positions related to our settlement with the internal revenue service (\u0093irs\u0094) for its 2000-2003 examination. this decline was partially offset by the tax effect of the european commission fine of $1.4 billion (\u0080899 million), which was not tax deductible. the fiscal year 2007 rate reflects a recurring effective tax rate of 31%, offset by a $195 million reduction resulting from various changes in tax positions taken in prior periods, related primarily to favorable developments in an irs position and multiple foreign audit assessments. during fiscal year 2006, we recorded a tax benefit of $108 million from the resolution of state audits and recorded a charge of $351 million (\u0080281\u00a0million)\u00a0from the european commission fine which was not tax deductible.  on july\u00a01, 2007, we adopted the provisions of the financial accounting standards board (\u0093fasb\u0094) interpretation no.\u00a048 (\u0093fin 48\u0094) accounting for uncertainty in income taxes \u0096 an interpretation of fasb statement no.\u00a0109, which provides a financial statement recognition threshold and measurement attribute for a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. adopting fin 48 had the following impact on our financial statements: increased current assets by $228 million, long-term assets by $1.1 billion, long-term liabilities by $2.1 billion, and our retained deficit by $395 million; and decreased our income taxes payable by $394 million. as of june\u00a030, 2008, we had $3.2 billion of unrecognized tax benefits of which $2.3 billion, if recognized, would affect our effective tax rate. as of july\u00a01, 2007, we had $7.1 billion of unrecognized tax benefits of which $5.3 billion, if recognized, would affect our effective tax rate. our policy is to include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense. interest totaled $121 million in fiscal year 2008. as of june\u00a030, 2008 and july\u00a01, 2007, we had accrued interest related to uncertain tax positions of $324 million and $863 million, respectively, net of federal income tax benefits, on our balance sheets.  financial condition  cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments totaled $23.7 billion and $23.4 billion as of june\u00a030, 2008 and 2007, respectively. equity and other investments were $6.6 billion and $10.1 billion as of june\u00a030, 2008 and 2007, respectively. our investments consist primarily of fixed-income securities, diversified among industries and individual issuers. our investments are generally liquid and investment grade. the portfolio is invested predominantly in u.s.-dollar-denominated securities, but also includes foreign-denominated securities in order to diversify financial risk. as a result of the special dividend paid in the second quarter of fiscal year 2005 and shares repurchased, our retained deficit, including accumulated other comprehensive income, was $26.6 billion at june\u00a030, 2008. our retained deficit is not expected to impact our future ability to operate or pay dividends given our continuing profitability and strong cash and financial position.  in general, and where applicable, we use quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities to price positions.\u00a0this pricing methodology applies to exchange-traded mutual funds, domestic and international equities, u.s. treasuries, and agency securities.\u00a0if quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities are not available to price positions, then we use inputs other than the quoted prices that are observable either directly or indirectly. assets and liabilities measured using unobservable inputs are an immaterial portion of our portfolio. while we own certain mortgage- and asset-backed fixed-income securities, our portfolio as of june\u00a030, 2008 does not contain direct exposure to subprime mortgages or structured vehicles that derive their value from subprime collateral. the majority of the mortgage-backed securities are collateralized by prime residential mortgages and carry a 100% principal and interest guarantee, primarily from federal national mortgage association, federal home loan mortgage corporation, and government national mortgage association.\u00a0the remainder of the mortgage position is collateralized by high quality international prime residential mortgage loans.  unearned revenue  unearned revenue is comprised of the following items:  volume licensing programs \u0096 represents customer billings for multi-year licensing arrangements, paid either upfront or annually at the beginning of each billing coverage period, which are accounted for as subscriptions with revenue recognized ratably over the billing coverage period.  \u00a0 \u00a0  table of contents  \u00a0part ii\u00a0  item 7  \u00a0 \u00a0 undelivered elements \u0096 represents free post-delivery telephone support and the right to receive unspecified

products licensed to original equipment manufacturers (\u0093oem\u0094), and perpetual licenses for current products under our open and select volume licensing programs. the amount recorded as unearned is based on the sales price of those elements when sold separately and is recognized ratably on a straight-line basis over the related product\u0092s life cycle. the percentage of revenue recorded as unearned due to undelivered elements ranges from approximately 15% to 25% of the sales price for windows xp home and approximately 5% to 15% of the sales price for windows xp professional, depending on the terms and conditions of the license and prices of the elements. product life cycles are currently estimated at three and one-half years for windows operating systems.  other \u0096

solutions products, xbox live subscriptions, mediaroom, and other offerings for which we have been paid upfront and earn the revenue when we provide the service or software, or otherwise meet the revenue recognition criteria.  the following table outlines the expected recognition of unearned revenue as of june\u00a030, 2008:  \u00a0 cash flows  fiscal year 2008 compared with fiscal year 2007  cash flow from operations increased $3.8 billion due to an increase in cash received from customers driven by 18% revenue growth, partially offset by the $1.4 billion (\u0080899 million) payment of the european commission fine. cash used for financing decreased $11.6 billion primarily due to a $15.0 billion decrease in common stock repurchases, partially offset by a $3.3 billion decrease in cash proceeds from the issuance of common stock. cash used for investing was $4.6 billion for fiscal year 2008 as compared with cash provided of $6.1 billion for fiscal year 2007. this decrease was primarily due to a $6.9 billion increase in cash paid for acquisition of companies, reflecting the purchase of aquantive in the first quarter of fiscal year 2008, a $918 million increase in purchases of property and equipment, and a $3.1 billion decrease in cash from combined investment purchases, sales, and maturities.  as a result of our settlement related to the 2000-2003 examination, we paid the irs approximately $3.1 billion during the first quarter of fiscal year 2009.  fiscal year 2007 compared with fiscal year 2006  cash flow from operations increased $3.4 billion due to an increase in cash received from customers driven by 15% revenue growth, along with a $1.6 billion decrease in cash outflow for other current assets primarily reflecting changes in inventory. cash used for financing increased $4.0 billion. several events occurred during fiscal year 2007 affecting cash used for financing. we issued $6.8 billion of common stock, including $3.3 billion related to 113\u00a0million call options exercised by jpmorgan in december 2006. we also completed our tender offer on august\u00a017, 2006, which was included in the $27.6 billion of common stock repurchases. cash from investing decreased $1.9 billion due to a $3.5 billion decline in securities lending activity where cash collateral is received from the counterparty along with $1.2 billion spent on acquisitions of companies and additions to property and equipment. these impacts were partially offset by a $2.8 billion increase in net cash from combined investment purchases, sales, and maturities.  \u00a0 \u00a0    table of contents  \u00a0part ii\u00a0  item 7  \u00a0 \u00a0 we have no material long-term debt. stockholders\u0092 equity at june\u00a030, 2008, was $36.3 billion. we will continue to invest in sales, marketing, product support infrastructure, and existing and advanced areas of technology. additions to property and equipment will continue, including new facilities, data centers, and computer systems for research and development, sales and marketing, support, and administrative staff. commitments for constructing new buildings were $1.2 billion on june\u00a030, 2008. we have operating leases for most u.s. and international sales and support offices and certain equipment under which we incurred rental expense totaling $398 million, $325 million, and $271 million in fiscal years 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively. we have not engaged in any related party transactions or arrangements with unconsolidated entities or other persons that are reasonably likely to materially affect liquidity or the availability of capital resources.  during fiscal years 2008 and 2007, our board of directors declared the following dividends:  \u00a0 on july\u00a020, 2006, we announced the completion of the repurchase program initially approved by our board of directors on july\u00a020, 2004 to buy back up to $30.0 billion in microsoft common stock. during fiscal year 2006, we repurchased 754\u00a0million shares, or $19.8 billion, of our common stock under this plan. on july\u00a020, 2006, we announced that our board of directors authorized two new share repurchase programs: a $20.0 billion tender offer, which was completed on august\u00a017, 2006; and authorization for up to an additional $20.0 billion ongoing share repurchase program with an expiration of june\u00a030, 2011. under the tender offer, we repurchased approximately 155\u00a0million shares of common stock, or 1.5% of our common shares outstanding, for approximately $3.8 billion at a price per share of $24.75. on august\u00a018, 2006, we announced that the authorization for the $20.0 billion ongoing share repurchase program had been increased by approximately $16.2 billion. as a result, we were authorized to repurchase additional shares in an amount up to $36.2 billion through june\u00a030, 2011. as of june\u00a030, 2008, approximately $2.7 billion remained of the $36.2 billion approved repurchase amount.  we believe existing cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments, together with funds generated from operations, should be sufficient to meet operating requirements, regular quarterly dividends, and planned share repurchases. our philosophy regarding the maintenance of a balance sheet with a large component of cash and short-term investments, as well as equity and other investments, reflects our views on potential future capital requirements related to research and development, creation and expansion of sales distribution channels, investments and acquisitions, share dilution management, legal risks, and challenges to our business model. we regularly assess our investment management approach in view of our current and potential future needs.  off-balance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations  we provide indemnifications of varying scope and amount to certain customers against claims of intellectual property infringement made by third parties arising from the use of our products. we evaluate estimated losses for these indemnifications under sfas no.\u00a05, accounting for contingencies, as interpreted by fasb interpretation no.\u00a045, guarantor\u0092s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees, including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others. we consider factors such as the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss. to date, we have not encountered material costs as a result of these obligations and have not accrued any material liabilities related to these indemnifications in our financial statements.  \u00a0 \u00a0  table of contents  \u00a0part ii\u00a0  item 7  \u00a0 \u00a0 contractual obligations  the following table summarizes our outstanding contractual obligations as of june\u00a030, 2008:  \u00a0 \u00a0 recently issued accounting standards  recently adopted accounting pronouncements  on july\u00a01, 2007, we adopted fin 48 which provides a financial statement recognition threshold and measurement attribute for a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. under fin 48, we may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position should be measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. fin 48 also provides guidance on derecognition of income tax assets and liabilities, classification of current and deferred income tax assets and liabilities, accounting for interest and penalties associated with tax positions, and income tax disclosures. upon adoption, we recognized a $395 million charge to our beginning retained deficit as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle. see note 11 \u0096 income taxes of the notes to financial statements (part ii, item\u00a08).  on july\u00a01, 2007, we adopted emerging issues task force issue no.\u00a006-2 (\u0093eitf 06-2\u0094), accounting for sabbatical leave and other similar benefits pursuant to fasb statement no.\u00a043. eitf 06-2 requires companies to accrue the costs of compensated absences under a sabbatical or similar benefit arrangement over the requisite service period. upon adoption, we recognized a $17 million charge to our beginning retained deficit as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle.  \u00a0 \u00a0    table of contents  \u00a0part ii\u00a0  item 7  \u00a0 \u00a0 recent accounting pronouncements not yet adopted  in march 2008, the fasb issued sfas no.\u00a0161, disclosures about derivative instruments and hedging activities, an amendment of fasb statement no.\u00a0133, which requires additional disclosures about the objectives of the derivative instruments and hedging activities, the method of accounting for such instruments under sfas no.\u00a0133 and its related interpretations, and a tabular disclosure of the effects of such instruments and related hedged items on our financial position, financial performance, and cash flows. sfas no.\u00a0161 is effective for us beginning january\u00a01, 2009. we are currently assessing the potential impact that adoption of sfas no.\u00a0161 may have on our financial statements.  in december 2007, the fasb issued sfas no.\u00a0141r, business combinations, which replaces sfas no.\u00a0141. the statement retains the purchase method of accounting for acquisitions, but requires a number of changes, including changes in the way assets and liabilities are recognized in the purchase accounting. it also changes the recognition of assets acquired and liabilities assumed arising from contingencies, requires the capitalization of in-process research and development at fair value, and requires the expensing of acquisition-related costs as incurred. sfas no.\u00a0141r is effective for us beginning july\u00a01, 2009 and will apply prospectively to business combinations completed on or after that date.  in december 2007, the fasb issued sfas no.\u00a0160, noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements, an amendment of arb no.\u00a051, which changes the accounting and reporting for minority interests. minority interests will be recharacterized as noncontrolling interests and will be reported as a component of equity separate from the parent\u0092s equity, and purchases or sales of equity interests that do not result in a change in control will be accounted for as equity transactions. in addition, net income attributable to the noncontrolling interest will be included in consolidated net income on the face of the income statement and, upon a loss of control, the interest sold, as well as any interest retained, will be recorded at fair value with any gain or loss recognized in earnings. sfas no.\u00a0160 is effective for us beginning july\u00a01, 2009 and will apply prospectively, except for the presentation and disclosure requirements, which will apply retrospectively. we are currently assessing the potential impact that adoption of sfas no.\u00a0160 may have on our financial statements.  in february 2007, the fasb issued sfas no.\u00a0159, the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities. sfas no.\u00a0159 gives us the irrevocable option to carry many financial assets and liabilities at fair values, with changes in fair value recognized in earnings. sfas no.\u00a0159 is effective for us beginning july\u00a01, 2008. we do not believe sfas no.\u00a0159 will have a material impact on our financial statements.  in september 2006, the fasb issued sfas no.\u00a0157, fair value measurements, which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. this statement does not require any new fair value measurements, but provides guidance on how to measure fair value by providing a fair value hierarchy used to classify the source of the information. in february 2008, the fasb issued fasb staff position (\u0093fsp\u0094) 157-2, effective date of fasb statement no.\u00a0157, which delays the effective date of sfas no.\u00a0157 for all nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities, except for items that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis (at least annually). sfas no.\u00a0157 is effective for us beginning july\u00a01, 2008; fsp 157-2 delays the effective date for certain items to july\u00a01, 2009. we do not believe sfas no.\u00a0157 will have a material impact on our financial statements.  application of critical accounting policies  \u00a0 our financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with u.s. gaap. preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. these estimates and assumptions are affected by management\u0092s application of accounting policies. critical accounting policies for us include revenue recognition, impairment of investment securities, impairment of goodwill, accounting for research and development costs, accounting for contingencies, accounting for income taxes, accounting for stock-based compensation, and accounting for product warranties.  we account for the licensing of software in accordance with american institute of certified public accountants statement of position (\u0093sop\u0094) 97-2, software revenue recognition. the application of sop 97-2 requires judgment, including whether a software arrangement includes multiple elements, and if so, whether vendor-specific objective evidence (\u0093vsoe\u0094) of fair value exists for those elements. for some of our products, customers receive certain   \u00a0 \u00a0  table of contents  \u00a0part ii\u00a0  item 7  \u00a0 \u00a0  elements of our products over a period of time. these elements include free post-delivery telephone support and the right to receive unspecified upgrades/enhancements of microsoft internet explorer on a when-and-if-available basis. the fair value of these elements is recognized over the estimated life cycle for the windows xp and previous pc operating systems. for windows vista, there are no significant undelivered elements and accordingly, no license revenue is deferred for windows vista sales. changes to the elements in a software arrangement, the ability to identify vsoe for those elements, the fair value of the respective elements, and changes to a product\u0092s estimated life cycle could materially impact the amount of earned and unearned revenue. judgment is also required to assess whether future releases of certain software represent new products or upgrades and enhancements to existing products.  sfas no.\u00a0115, accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities, and staff accounting bulletin topic 5m, accounting for noncurrent marketable equity securities, provide guidance on determining when an investment is other-than-temporarily impaired. investments are reviewed quarterly for indicators of other-than-temporary impairment. this determination requires significant judgment. in making this judgment, we employ a systematic methodology quarterly that considers available quantitative and qualitative evidence in evaluating potential impairment of our investments. if the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value, we evaluate, among other factors, general market conditions, the duration and extent to which the fair value is less than cost, and our intent and ability to hold the investment. we also consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of and business outlook for the investee, including industry and sector performance, changes in technology, operational and financing cash flow factors, and rating agency actions. once a decline in fair value is determined to be other-than-temporary, an impairment charge is recorded and a new cost basis in the investment is established. if market, industry, and/or investee conditions deteriorate, we may incur future impairments.  sfas no.\u00a0142, goodwill and other intangible assets, requires that goodwill be tested for impairment at the reporting unit level (operating segment or one level below an operating segment) on an annual basis (july 1 for us) and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. these events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate, legal factors, operating performance indicators, competition or sale or disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit. application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment, including the identification of reporting units, assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units, assignment of goodwill to reporting units, and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit. the fair value of each reporting unit is estimated using a discounted cash flow methodology. this analysis requires significant judgments, including estimation of future cash flows, which is dependent on internal forecasts, estimation of the long-term rate of growth for our business, the useful life over which cash flows will occur, and determination of our weighted average cost of capital. changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and goodwill impairment for each reporting unit. we allocate goodwill to reporting units based on the reporting unit expected to benefit from the combination. we evaluate our reporting units on an annual basis and, if necessary, reassign goodwill using a relative fair value allocation approach.  we account for research and development costs in accordance with applicable accounting pronouncements, including sfas no.\u00a02, accounting for research and development costs, and sfas no.\u00a086, accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold, leased, or otherwise marketed. sfas no.\u00a086 specifies that costs incurred internally in researching and developing a computer software product should be charged to expense until technological feasibility has been established for the product. once technological feasibility is established, all software costs should be capitalized until the product is available for general release to customers. judgment is required in determining when technological feasibility of a product is established. we have determined that technological feasibility for our software products is reached after all high-risk development issues have been resolved through coding and testing. generally, this occurs shortly before the products are released to manufacturing.  the outcomes of legal proceedings and claims brought against us are subject to significant uncertainty. sfas no.\u00a05, accounting for contingencies, requires that an estimated loss from a loss contingency such as a legal proceeding or claim should be accrued by a charge to income if it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. disclosure of a contingency is required if there is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss has been incurred. in determining whether a loss should be accrued we evaluate, among other factors, the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss. changes in these factors could materially impact our results of operations, financial position, or our cash flows.  \u00a0 \u00a0    table of contents  \u00a0part ii\u00a0  item 7  \u00a0 \u00a0 sfas no.\u00a0109, accounting for income taxes, establishes financial accounting and reporting standards for the effect of income taxes. the objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entity\u0092s financial statements or tax returns. accruals for uncertain tax positions are provided for in accordance with the requirements of fin 48. under fin 48, we may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position should be measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. fin 48 also provides guidance on derecognition of income tax assets and liabilities, classification of current and deferred income tax assets and liabilities, accounting for interest and penalties associated with tax positions, and income tax disclosures. judgment is required in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns. variations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could materially impact our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.  we account for stock-based compensation in accordance with sfas no.\u00a0123(r), share-based payment. under the fair value recognition provisions of this statement, share-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period. determining the fair value of share-based awards at the grant date requires judgment, including estimating expected dividends. in addition, judgment is also required in estimating the amount of share-based awards that are expected to be forfeited. if actual results differ significantly from these estimates, stock-based compensation expense and our results of operations could be materially impacted.  we account for product warranties in accordance with sfas no.\u00a05, accounting for contingencies. we provide for the estimated costs of hardware and software warranties at the time the related revenue is recognized. for hardware warranty, we estimate the costs based on historical and projected product failure rates, historical and projected repair costs, and knowledge of specific product failures (if any). the specific hardware warranty terms and conditions vary depending upon the product sold and country in which we do business, but generally include parts and labor over a period generally ranging from 90\u00a0days to three years. for software warranty, we estimate the costs to provide bug fixes, such as security patches, over the life of the software. we regularly reevaluate our estimates to assess the adequacy of the recorded warranty liabilities and adjust the amounts as necessary.  \u00a0 \u00a0  table of contents  \u00a0part ii\u00a0  item 7  \u00a0 \u00a0 statement of management\u0092s responsibility for financial statements  management is responsible for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements and related information that are presented in this report. the consolidated financial statements, which include amounts based on management\u0092s estimates and judgments, have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america.  the company designs and maintains accounting and internal control systems to provide reasonable assurance at reasonable cost that assets are safeguarded against loss from unauthorized use or disposition, and that the financial records are reliable for preparing financial statements and maintaining accountability for assets. these systems are augmented by written policies, an organizational structure providing division of responsibilities, careful selection and training of qualified personnel, and a program of internal audits.  the company engaged deloitte\u00a0& touche llp, an independent registered public accounting firm, to audit and render an opinion on the consolidated financial statements and internal control over financial reporting in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board (united states).  the board of directors, through its audit committee, consisting solely of independent directors of the company, meets periodically with management, internal auditors, and our independent registered public accounting firm to ensure that each is meeting its responsibilities and to discuss matters concerning internal controls and financial reporting. deloitte\u00a0& touche llp and the internal auditors each have full and free access to the audit committee.  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0    table of contents  \u00a0part ii\u00a0  item 7a  \u00a0 \u00a0  item\u00a07a.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk  we are exposed to foreign currency, interest rate, fixed-income, equity, and commodity price risks. a portion of these risks is hedged, but fluctuations could impact our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows. we hedge a portion of anticipated revenue and accounts receivable exposure to foreign currency fluctuations, primarily with option contracts. we monitor our foreign currency exposures daily to maximize the overall effectiveness of our foreign currency hedge positions. principal currencies hedged include the euro, japanese yen, british pound, and canadian dollar. fixed-income securities and interest rate derivatives are subject primarily to interest rate risk. the portfolio is diversified and structured to minimize credit risk. securities held in our equity and other investments portfolio and equity derivatives are subject to price risk, and generally are not hedged. however, we use put-call collars to hedge our price risk on certain equity securities that are held primarily for strategic purposes. commodity derivatives held for the purpose of portfolio diversification are subject to commodity price risk.  we use a value-at-risk (\u0093var\u0094) model to estimate and quantify our market risks. var is the expected loss, for a given confidence level, in fair value of our portfolio due to adverse market movements over a defined time horizon. the var model is not intended to represent actual losses in fair value, but is used as a risk estimation and management tool. the model used for currencies, equities, and commodities is geometric brownian motion, which allows incorporation of optionality with regard to these risk exposures. for interest rate risk, exposures such as key rate durations and spread durations are used in calculations that reflect the principle that fixed-income security prices revert to maturity value over time.  var is calculated by computing the exposures of each holding\u0092s market value to a range of over 1,000 equity, fixed-income, foreign exchange, and commodity risk factors. the exposures are then used to compute the parameters of a distribution of potential changes in the total market value of all holdings, taking into account the weighted historical volatilities of the different rates and prices and the weighted historical correlations among the different rates and prices. the var is then calculated as the total loss that will not be exceeded at the 97.5 percentile confidence level or, alternatively stated, the losses could exceed the var in 25 out of 1,000 cases. several risk factors are not captured in the model, including liquidity risk, operational risk, credit risk, and legal risk.  certain securities in our equity portfolio are held for strategic purposes. we hedge the value of a portion of these securities through the use of derivative contracts such as put-call collars. in these arrangements, we hedge a security\u0092s equity price risk below the purchased put strike and forgo most or all of the benefits of the security\u0092s appreciation above the sold call strike. we also hold equity securities for general investment return purposes.  the var amounts disclosed below are used as a risk management tool and reflect an estimate of potential reductions in fair value of our portfolio. losses in fair value over the specified holding period can exceed the reported var by significant amounts and can also accumulate over a longer time horizon than the specified holding period used in the var analysis. var amounts are not necessarily reflective of potential accounting losses, including determinations of other-than-temporary losses in fair value in accordance with u.s. gaap.  var numbers are shown separately for interest rate, currency rate, equity price, and commodity price risks. these var numbers include the underlying portfolio positions and related hedges. we use historical data to estimate var. given the reliance on historical data, var is most effective in estimating risk exposures in markets in which there are no fundamental changes or shifts in market conditions. an inherent limitation in var is that the distribution of past changes in market risk factors may not produce accurate predictions of future market risk.  the following table sets forth the one-day var for substantially all of our positions as of and for the years ended june\u00a030, 2008 and 2007:  \u00a0 total one-day var for the combined risk categories was $123 million at june\u00a030, 2008 and $95 million at june\u00a030, 2007. the total var is 34% less at june\u00a030, 2008, and 39% less at june\u00a030, 2007, than the sum of the separate risk categories in the above table due to the diversification benefit of the overall portfolio.  \u00a0

 item 8  \u00a0 \u00a0 notes to financial statements  note 1\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0accounting policies  accounting principles  the financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america.  principles of consolidation  the financial statements include the accounts of microsoft corporation and its subsidiaries. intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated. equity investments in which we exercise significant influence but do not control and are not the primary beneficiary are accounted for using the equity method. investments in which we are not able to exercise significant influence over the investee and which do not have readily determinable fair values are accounted for under the cost method.  estimates and assumptions  preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. examples include estimates of loss contingencies, product warranties, product life cycles, product returns, and stock-based compensation forfeiture rates; assumptions such as the elements comprising a software arrangement, including the distinction between upgrades/enhancements and new products; when technological feasibility is achieved for our products; the potential outcome of future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns; estimating the fair value and/or goodwill impairment for our reporting units; and determining when investment impairments are other-than-temporary. actual results and outcomes may differ from management\u0092s estimates and assumptions.  foreign currencies  assets and liabilities recorded in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rate on the balance sheet date. revenue and expenses are translated at average rates of exchange prevailing during the year. translation adjustments resulting from this process are charged or credited to other comprehensive income (\u0093oci\u0094).  revenue recognition  revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the fee is fixed or determinable, and collectibility is probable. we enter into certain arrangements where we are obligated to deliver multiple products and/or services (multiple elements). in these arrangements, we generally allocate the total revenue among the elements based on the sales price of each element when sold separately (vendor-specific objective evidence).  revenue for retail packaged products, products licensed to original equipment manufacturers (\u0093oems\u0094), and perpetual licenses for current products under our open and select volume licensing programs generally is recognized as products are shipped. a portion of the revenue related to certain products, which include all windows xp and previous pc operating systems, is recorded as unearned due to undelivered elements including, in some cases, free post-delivery telephone support and the right to receive unspecified upgrades/enhancements of microsoft internet explorer on a when-and-if-available basis. the amount of revenue allocated to undelivered elements is based on the vendor-specific objective evidence of fair value for those elements using the residual method. under the residual method, the total fair value of the undelivered elements, as indicated by vendor-specific objective evidence, is recorded as unearned, and the difference between the total arrangement fee and the amount recorded as unearned for the undelivered elements is recognized as revenue related to delivered elements. unearned revenue due to undelivered elements is recognized ratably on a straight-line basis over the related product\u0092s life cycle. revenue related to windows vista is not subject to a similar deferral because there are no significant undelivered elements.  revenue from multi-year licensing arrangements are accounted for as subscriptions, with billings recorded as unearned revenue and recognized as revenue ratably over the billing coverage period. certain multi-year licensing arrangements include rights to receive future versions of software product on a when-and-if-available basis under open and select volume licensing programs (software assurance). in addition, other multi-year licensing   \u00a0 \u00a0    table of contents  \u00a0part ii\u00a0  item 8  \u00a0 \u00a0  arrangements include a perpetual license for current products combined with rights to receive future versions of software products on a when-and-if-available basis under open, select, and enterprise agreement volume licensing programs. premier support services agreements, msn internet access subscriptions, xbox live, and microsoft developer network subscriptions are also accounted for as subscriptions.  revenue related to our xbox game console and other hardware components is recognized upon shipment of the product to retailers. revenue related to games published by us is recognized when those games have been delivered to retailers. revenue related to games published by third parties for use on the xbox platform is recognized when games are manufactured by the game publishers. online advertising revenue is recognized as advertisements are displayed. search advertising revenue is recognized when the ad appears in the search results or when the action necessary to earn the revenue has been completed. consulting services revenue is recognized as services are rendered, generally based on the negotiated hourly rate in the consulting arrangement and the number of hours worked during the period. consulting revenue for fixed-price services arrangements is recognized as services are provided.  revenue generally is recognized net of any taxes collected from customers and subsequently remitted to governmental authorities.  costs related to insignificant obligations, including bug fixes and technical support, are accrued when the related revenue is recognized. provisions are recorded for estimated returns, concessions, warranties, and bad debts.  cost of revenue  cost of revenue includes manufacturing and distribution costs for products sold and programs licensed, operating costs related to product support service centers and product distribution centers, costs incurred to support and maintain internet-based products and services, warranty costs, inventory write-downs, costs associated with the delivery of consulting services, and the amortization of capitalized research and development costs associated with software products that have reached technological feasibility.  research and development  research and development expenses include payroll, employee benefits, stock-based compensation, and other headcount-related expenses associated with product development. research and development expenses also include third-party development and programming costs, localization costs incurred to translate software for international markets, the amortization of purchased software code and services content, and in-process research and development. we have determined that technological feasibility for our software products is reached shortly before the products are released to manufacturing. the amortization of these costs is included in cost of revenue over the estimated lives of the products.  sales and marketing  sales and marketing expenses include payroll, employee benefits, stock-based compensation, and other headcount-related expenses associated with sales and marketing personnel, and the cost of advertising, promotions, tradeshows, seminars, and other programs. advertising costs are expensed as incurred. advertising expense was $1.2 billion, $1.3 billion, and $1.2 billion in fiscal years 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively.  product warranty  we provide for the estimated costs of hardware and software warranties at the time the related revenue is recognized. for hardware warranty, we estimate the costs based on historical and projected product failure rates, historical and projected repair costs, and knowledge of specific product failures (if any). the specific hardware warranty terms and conditions vary depending upon the product sold and country in which we do business, but generally include parts and labor over a period generally ranging from 90\u00a0days to three years. for software warranty, we estimate the costs to provide bug fixes, such as security patches, over the estimated life of the software. we regularly reevaluate our estimates to assess the adequacy of the recorded warranty liabilities and adjust the amounts as necessary.  \u00a0 \u00a0  table of contents  \u00a0part ii\u00a0  item 8  \u00a0 \u00a0 stock-based compensation we account for stock-based compensation in accordance with sfas no.\u00a0123(r), share-based payment. under the fair value recognition provisions of this statement, share-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the applicable vesting period of the stock award (generally three to five years) using the straight-line method.  income taxes  income tax expense includes u.s. and international income taxes, plus the provision for u.s. taxes on undistributed earnings of international subsidiaries not deemed to be permanently invested. certain items of income and expense are not reported in tax returns and financial statements in the same year. the tax effect of such temporary differences is reported as deferred income taxes.  financial instruments  we consider all highly liquid interest-earning investments with a maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase to be cash equivalents. the fair value of these investments approximates their carrying value. in general, investments with original maturities of greater than three months and remaining maturities of less than one year are classified as short-term investments. investments with maturities beyond one year may be classified as short-term based on their highly liquid nature and because such marketable securities represent the investment of cash that is available for current operations. all cash equivalents and short-term investments are classified as available for sale and are recorded at market value using the specific identification method. changes in market value are reflected in oci (excluding other-than-temporary impairments).  equity and other investments classified as long-term include both debt and equity instruments. debt securities and publicly traded equity securities are classified as available for sale and are recorded at market using the specific identification method. changes in market value are reflected in oci (excluding other-than-temporary impairments). all other investments, excluding those accounted for using the equity method, are recorded at cost.  we lend certain fixed-income and equity securities to enhance investment income. the loaned securities continue to be carried as investments on our balance sheet. collateral and/or security interest received is determined based upon the underlying security lent and the creditworthiness of the borrower. cash collateral is recorded as an asset with a corresponding liability.  investments are considered to be impaired when a decline in fair value is judged to be other-than-temporary. we employ a systematic methodology on a quarterly basis that considers available quantitative and qualitative evidence in evaluating potential impairment of our investments. if the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value, we evaluate, among other factors, general market conditions, the duration and extent to which the fair value is less than cost, and our intent and ability to hold the investment. we also consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of and business outlook for the investee, including industry and sector performance, changes in technology, operational and financing cash flow factors, and rating agency actions. once a decline in fair value is determined to be other-than-temporary, an impairment charge is recorded and a new cost basis in the investment is established.  we use derivative instruments to manage exposures to foreign currency, equity price, interest rate and credit risks, to enhance returns, and to facilitate portfolio diversification. our objectives for holding derivatives include reducing, eliminating, and efficiently managing the economic impact of these exposures as effectively as possible. derivative instruments are recognized as either assets or liabilities and are measured at fair value. the accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation. for a derivative instrument designated as a fair-value hedge, the gain or loss is recognized in earnings in the period of change together with the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item attributed to the risk being hedged. for a derivative instrument designated as a cash-flow hedge, the effective portion of the derivative\u0092s gain or loss is initially reported as a component of oci and is subsequently recognized in earnings when the hedged exposure affects earnings. the ineffective portion of the gain or loss is recognized in earnings. for options designated either as fair-value or cash-flow hedges, changes in the time value are excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and are recognized in earnings. gains and losses from changes in fair values of derivatives that are not designated as hedges for accounting purposes are recognized in earnings.  \u00a0 \u00a0    table of contents  \u00a0part ii\u00a0  item 8  \u00a0 \u00a0 foreign currency risk.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0certain assets, liabilities, and forecasted transactions are exposed to foreign currency risk. we monitor our foreign currency exposures daily to maximize the overall effectiveness of our foreign currency hedge positions. options are used to hedge a portion of forecasted international revenue for up to three years in the future and are designated as cash-flow hedging instruments under statement of financial accounting standards (\u0093sfas\u0094) no.\u00a0133, accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities. principal currencies hedged include the euro, japanese yen, british pound, and canadian dollar. certain non-u.s. dollar denominated securities are hedged using foreign exchange forward contracts that are designated as fair-value hedging instruments under sfas no.\u00a0133. certain options and forwards not designated as hedging instruments under sfas no.\u00a0133 are also used to hedge the impact of the variability in exchange rates on accounts receivable and collections denominated in certain foreign currencies and to manage other foreign currency exposures.  equities price risk.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0equity investments are subject to market price risk. from time to time, we use and designate options to hedge fair values on certain equity securities. we determine the security selected for hedging by evaluating market conditions, up-front costs, and other relevant factors. certain options, futures, and swap contracts, not designated as hedging instruments under sfas no.\u00a0133, are also used to manage equity exposures.  interest rate risk.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0fixed-income securities are subject to interest rate risk. the fixed-income portfolio is diversified and consists primarily of investment grade securities to minimize credit risk. we use exchange-traded option and futures contracts and over-the-counter swap contracts, not designated as hedging instruments under sfas no.\u00a0133, to hedge interest rate risk.  other derivatives.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0swap contracts, not designated as hedging instruments under sfas no.\u00a0133, are used to manage exposures to credit risks, enhance returns, and to facilitate portfolio diversification. in addition, we may invest in warrants to purchase securities of other companies as a strategic investment. warrants that can be net share settled are deemed derivative financial instruments and are not designated as hedging instruments. \u0093to be announced\u0094 forward purchase commitments of mortgage-backed assets are also considered derivatives in cases where physical delivery of the assets is not taken at the earliest available delivery date. all derivative instruments not designated as hedging instruments are recorded at fair value, with changes in value recognized in earnings during the period of change.  allowance for doubtful accounts  the allowance for doubtful accounts reflects our best estimate of probable losses inherent in the accounts receivable balance. we determine the allowance based on known troubled accounts, historical experience, and other currently available evidence. activity in the allowance for doubtful accounts was as follows:  \u00a0 inventories  inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market, using the average cost method. cost includes materials, labor, and manufacturing overhead related to the purchase and production of inventories. we regularly review inventory quantities on hand, future purchase commitments with our suppliers, and the estimated utility of our inventory. if our review indicates a reduction in utility below carrying value, we reduce our inventory to a new cost basis.  \u00a0 \u00a0  table of contents  \u00a0part ii\u00a0  item 8  \u00a0 \u00a0 property and equipment  property and equipment is stated at cost and depreciated using the straight-line method over the shorter of the estimated life of the asset or the lease term, ranging from one to 15 years. computer software developed or obtained for internal use is depreciated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the software, generally three years or less.  goodwill  goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis as of july\u00a01, and between annual tests if indicators of potential impairment exist, using a fair-value-based approach. no impairment of goodwill has been identified during any of the periods presented.  intangible assets  intangible assets are amortized using the straight-line method over their estimated period of benefit, ranging from one to ten years. we evaluate the recoverability of intangible assets periodically and take into account events or circumstances that warrant revised estimates of useful lives or that indicate that impairment exists. all of our intangible assets are subject to amortization. no material impairments of intangible assets have been identified during any of the periods presented.  recently issued accounting standards  recently adopted accounting pronouncements  on july\u00a01, 2007, we adopted the provisions of financial accounting standards board (\u0093fasb\u0094) interpretation no.\u00a048 (\u0093fin 48\u0094), accounting for uncertainty in income taxes \u0096 an interpretation of fasb statement no.\u00a0109, which provides a financial statement recognition threshold and measurement attribute for a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. under fin 48, we may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position should be measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. fin 48 also provides guidance on derecognition of income tax assets and liabilities, classification of current and deferred income tax assets and liabilities, accounting for interest and penalties associated with tax positions, and income tax disclosures. upon adoption, we recognized a $395 million charge to our beginning retained deficit as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle. see note 11 \u0096 income taxes.  on july\u00a01, 2007, we adopted emerging issues task force issue no.\u00a006-2 (\u0093eitf 06-2\u0094), accounting for sabbatical leave and other similar benefits pursuant to fasb statement no.\u00a043. eitf 06-2 requires companies to accrue the costs of compensated absences under a sabbatical or similar benefit arrangement over the requisite service period. upon adoption, we recognized a $17 million charge to our beginning retained deficit as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle.  recent accounting pronouncements not yet adopted  in march 2008, the fasb issued sfas no.\u00a0161, disclosures about derivative instruments and hedging activities, an amendment of fas 133, which requires additional disclosures about the objectives of derivative instruments and hedging activities, the method of accounting for those instruments under sfas no.\u00a0133 and its related interpretations, and a tabular disclosure of the effects of those instruments and related hedged items on our financial position, financial performance, and cash flows. sfas no.\u00a0161 is effective for us beginning january\u00a01, 2009. we are currently assessing the potential impact that adoption of sfas no.\u00a0161 may have on our financial statements.  in december 2007, the fasb issued sfas no.\u00a0141r, business combinations, which replaces sfas no 141. the statement retains the purchase method of accounting for acquisitions, but requires a number of changes, including changes in the way assets and liabilities are recognized in the purchase accounting. it also changes the recognition of assets acquired and liabilities assumed arising from contingencies, requires the capitalization of in-process research and development at fair value, and requires the expensing of acquisition-related costs as incurred. sfas no.\u00a0141r is effective for us beginning july\u00a01, 2009 and will apply prospectively to business combinations completed on or after that date.  \u00a0 \u00a0    table of contents  \u00a0part ii\u00a0  item 8  \u00a0 \u00a0 in december 2007, the fasb issued sfas no.\u00a0160, noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements, an amendment of arb 51, which changes the accounting and reporting for minority interests. minority interests will be recharacterized as noncontrolling interests and will be reported as a component of equity separate from the parent\u0092s equity, and purchases or sales of equity interests that do not result in a change in control will be accounted for as equity transactions. in addition, net income attributable to the noncontrolling interest will be included in consolidated net income on the face of the income statement and, upon a loss of control, the interest sold, as well as any interest retained, will be recorded at fair value with any gain or loss recognized in earnings. sfas no.\u00a0160 is effective for us beginning july\u00a01, 2009 and will apply prospectively, except for the presentation and disclosure requirements, which will apply retrospectively. we are currently assessing the potential impact that adoption of sfas no.\u00a0160 may have on our financial statements.  in february 2007, the fasb issued sfas no.\u00a0159, the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities. sfas no.\u00a0159 gives us the irrevocable option to carry many financial assets and liabilities at fair value, with changes in fair value recognized in earnings. sfas no.\u00a0159 is effective for us beginning july\u00a01, 2008. we do not believe sfas no.\u00a0159 will have a material impact on our financial statements.  in september 2006, the fasb issued sfas no.\u00a0157, fair value measurements, which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. this statement does not require any new fair value measurements, but provides guidance on how to measure fair value by providing a fair value hierarchy used to classify the source of the information. in february 2008, the fasb issued fasb staff position (\u0093fsp\u0094) 157-2, effective date of fasb statement no.\u00a0157, which delays the effective date of sfas no.\u00a0157 for all nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities, except for items that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis (at least annually). sfas no.\u00a0157 is effective for us beginning july\u00a01, 2008; fsp 157-2 delays the effective date for certain items to july\u00a01, 2009. we do not believe sfas no.\u00a0157 will have a material impact on our financial statements.  note 2\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0earnings per share  basic earnings per share is computed on the basis of the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. diluted earnings per share is computed on the basis of the weighted average number of shares of common stock plus the effect of dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period using the treasury stock method. dilutive potential common shares include outstanding stock options, stock awards, and shared performance stock awards. the components of basic and diluted earnings per share are as follows:  \u00a0 for the years ended june\u00a030, 2008, 2007 and 2006, 91\u00a0million, 199\u00a0million, and 649\u00a0million shares, respectively, were attributable to outstanding stock options and were excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per share because the exercise prices of the stock options were greater than or equal to the average price of the common shares, and therefore their inclusion would have been anti-dilutive.  for the year ended june\u00a030, 2007, four million shared performance stock awards, out of the 14\u00a0million targeted amount outstanding, were excluded from the calculation of the diluted earnings per share because the number of shares ultimately issued was contingent on our performance against metrics established for the performance period, as discussed in note 18 \u0096 employee stock and savings plans.

\u00a0 investments with continuous unrealized losses for less than 12 months and 12 months or greater and their related fair values were as follows:  \u00a0 at june\u00a030, 2008, unrealized losses of $255 million consisted of: $121 million related to investment grade fixed-income securities, $21 million related to investments in high yield and emerging market fixed-income securities, $99 million related to domestic equity securities, and $14 million related to international equity securities. at june\u00a030, 2007, unrealized losses of $186 million consisted of: $161 million related to investment grade fixed-income securities, $7 million related to investments in high yield and emerging market fixed-income securities, $7 million related to domestic equity securities, and $11 million related to international equity securities. unrealized losses from fixed-income securities are primarily attributable to changes in interest rates. unrealized losses from domestic and international equities are due to market price movements. management does not believe any unrealized losses represent an other-than-temporary impairment based on our evaluation of available evidence as of june\u00a030, 2008.  common and preferred stock and other investments that are restricted for more than one year or are not publicly traded are recorded at cost. at june\u00a030, 2008, the recorded basis and estimated fair value of these investments was $289 million. at june\u00a030, 2007, the recorded basis and estimated fair value of these investments was $38 million. the estimate of fair value is based on publicly available market information or other estimates determined by management.  \u00a0 \u00a0    table of contents  \u00a0part ii\u00a0  item 8  \u00a0 \u00a0 the maturities of

ineffectiveness, determined in accordance with sfas no.\u00a0133, accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities, did not have a significant impact on earnings for fiscal years 2008, 2007, or 2006. during fiscal year 2008, $274 million in gains on fair-value hedges from changes in time value and $324 million in losses on cash-flow hedges from changes in time value were excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and were included in investment income and other. during fiscal year 2007, $219 million in gains on fair-value hedges from changes in time value and $361 million in losses on cash-flow hedges from changes in time value were excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and were included in investment income and other. during fiscal year 2006, $217 million in gains on fair-value hedges from changes in time value and $399 million in losses on cash-flow hedges from changes in time value were excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and were included in investment income and other.  derivative gains and losses included in oci are reclassified into earnings at the time forecasted revenue or the sale of an underlying investment is recognized. during fiscal year 2008, $104 million of derivative gains were reclassified to revenue. during fiscal year 2007, $168 million of derivative gains were reclassified to revenue. during fiscal year 2006, $166 million of derivative gains were reclassified to revenue and $23 million in derivative gains were reclassified to investment income and other.  we estimate that $111 million of net derivative gains included in oci will be reclassified into earnings within the next 12 months. no significant amounts of gains or losses were reclassified from oci into earnings as a result of forecasted transactions that failed to occur for fiscal years 2008, 2007, and 2006.  derivative fair values are based on quoted market prices or pricing models using current market data. the fair

assured extensions, computer equipment and software range from two to three years, and furniture and equipment range from one to five years. land is not depreciated.  during fiscal years 2008, 2007, and 2006, depreciation expense was $1.4 billion, $1.2 billion, and $863 million, respectively. the majority of depreciation expense in all years related to computer equipment.  note 8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0acquisitions  on august\u00a010, 2007, we acquired all the outstanding shares of aquantive, inc. (\u0093aquantive\u0094) for $5.9 billion, which was paid primarily in cash. headquartered in seattle, washington, aquantive is a digital marketing business that we expect will play a key role in the future development of our online services business. we also believe the acquisition will help us build and support next-generation advertiser and publisher solutions in environments such as cross media planning, video-on-demand, and internet protocol television. aquantive was consolidated into our results of operations starting august\u00a010, 2007, the acquisition date.  as a result of the aquantive acquisition, we recorded $5.2 billion of goodwill in our online services business. of the $939 million of acquired intangible assets, $24 million was assigned to in-process research and development assets and was expensed. the remaining acquired intangible assets include $476 million of customer relationships with a weighted average life of six years, $327 million of technology-based intangible assets with a weighted average life of four years, and $112 million of other intangible assets with a weighted average life of five years.  on april\u00a024, 2008, we acquired all the outstanding shares of fast search\u00a0& transfer asa (\u0093fast\u0094) for $1.3 billion, which was paid primarily in cash. headquartered in oslo, norway, fast is an enterprise search company that we expect will broaden our enterprise search technology product offerings to businesses and will enable innovation in related areas such as our portal and content management. fast was consolidated into our results of operations starting april\u00a024, 2008, the acquisition date.  \u00a0 \u00a0    table of contents  \u00a0part ii\u00a0  item 8  \u00a0 \u00a0 as a result of the fast acquisition, we

expensed. the remaining acquired intangible assets include $27 million of customer relationships with a weighted average life of seven years, $134 million of technology-based intangible assets with a weighted average life of five years, and $70 million of other intangible assets with a weighted average life of six years.  the following table summarizes the estimated fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the dates of the aquantive and fast acquisitions:  \u00a0 in addition to aquantive and fast, we acquired 19 other entities during fiscal year 2008 for total consideration of $1.6 billion which was paid primarily in cash and included:  \u00a0 \u00a0 as a result of our acquisition of danger and the 18 other entities, we recorded $1.2 billion of goodwill. in addition, $37 million was assigned to in-process research and development assets and was expensed. all of the entities have been consolidated into our results of operations since their respective acquisition dates. the purchase price allocations for these acquisitions are preliminary and subject to revision as more detailed analyses are completed and additional information about fair value of assets and liabilities becomes available. any change in the estimated fair value of the net assets of the acquired companies will change the amount of the purchase price allocable to goodwill. pro forma results of operations have not been presented because the effects of danger and the 18 other acquisitions, individually and in aggregate, were not material.  \u00a0 \u00a0  table of contents  \u00a0part ii\u00a0  item 8  \u00a0 \u00a0 note 9\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0goodwill  changes in the carrying amount of goodwill for fiscal years 2008 and 2007 by segment were as follows:  \u00a0 we test goodwill for impairment annually on july\u00a01 at the reporting unit level using a fair value approach, in accordance with the provisions of sfas no.\u00a0142, goodwill and other intangible assets. our annual testing resulted in no impairments of goodwill in fiscal years 2008 and 2007. if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value, goodwill will be evaluated for impairment between annual tests.  none of the amount recorded as goodwill during fiscal year 2008 is expected to be deductible for tax purposes. the purchase price allocation for acquisitions is preliminary for up to 12 months after the acquisition date and subject to revision as more detailed analyses are completed and additional information about fair value of assets and liabilities become available. any change in the fair value of the net assets of the acquired company will change the amount of the purchase price allocable to goodwill. purchase price adjustments are included in \u0093other\u0094 in the above table.  note 10\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0intangible assets  the components of finite-lived intangible assets were

2007 were as follows:  \u00a0 intangible asset additions included $694 million of technology-based intangible assets with a weighted-average life of four years, and $782 million of other intangible assets with a weighted-average life of six years, related to the acquisitions of aquantive, fast, danger, and 18 other entities acquired. see note 8 \u0096 acquisitions.  acquired intangibles generally are amortized on a straight-line basis over weighted average lives. intangible assets amortization expense was $472 million for fiscal year 2008, $236 million for fiscal year 2007, and $127

international components of income before income taxes were as follows:  \u00a0 the items accounting for the difference between income taxes computed at the federal statutory rate and the provision for income taxes were as follows:  \u00a0 in general, other reconciling items consist of interest, u.s. state income taxes, domestic production deductions, and research credits. in fiscal years 2008 and 2006, there were no individually significant other reconciling items. other reconciling items in fiscal year 2007 included the impact of a $195 million reduction resulting from various changes in tax positions taken in prior periods, related primarily to favorable developments in an irs position and multiple foreign audit assessments.  the components of the deferred income tax assets and liabilities were as follows:  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0    table of contents  \u00a0part ii\u00a0  item 8  \u00a0 \u00a0 deferred income tax balances reflect the effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases and are stated at enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when taxes are actually paid or recovered.  we have not provided deferred u.s. income taxes or foreign withholding taxes on temporary differences of approximately $7.5 billion resulting from earnings for certain non-u.s. subsidiaries which are permanently reinvested outside the united states. the amount of unrecognized deferred tax liability associated with these temporary differences is approximately $2.2 billion.  income taxes paid were $5.4 billion in fiscal year 2008, $5.2 billion in fiscal year 2007, and $4.8 billion in fiscal year 2006.  fin 48  on july\u00a01, 2007, we adopted the provisions of fin 48 which had the following impact on our financial statements: increased current assets by $228 million, long-term assets by $1.1 billion, long-term liabilities by $2.1 billion, and retained deficit by $395 million; and decreased income taxes payable by $394 million. as of june\u00a030, 2008, we had $3.2 billion of unrecognized tax benefits of which $2.3 billion, if recognized, would affect our effective tax rate. as of july\u00a01, 2007, we had $7.1 billion of unrecognized tax benefits of which $5.3 billion, if recognized, would affect our effective tax rate. our policy is to include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense. interest totaled $121 million in fiscal year 2008. as of june\u00a030, 2008 and july\u00a01, 2007, we had accrued interest related to uncertain tax positions of $324 million and $863 million, respectively, net of federal income tax benefits, on our balance sheets.  the aggregate changes in the balance of unrecognized tax benefits were as follows:  \u00a0 during fiscal year 2008, we reached a settlement with the internal revenue service (\u0093irs\u0094) on its 2000-2003 examination.\u00a0as a result, we reduced our unrecognized tax benefits by $4.8 billion and recognized a tax provision reduction of $1.2 billion.\u00a0we are under audit by the irs for the tax years 2004-2006.\u00a0we do not believe it is reasonably possible that the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits will significantly increase or decrease within the next 12 months as we do not believe the examination will be concluded within the next 12 months. as a result of our settlement related to the 2000-2003 examination, we paid the irs approximately $3.1 billion during the first quarter of fiscal year 2009.  we are subject to income tax in many jurisdictions outside the united states, none of which are individually material to our financial position, cash flows, or results of operations.  note 12\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0unearned revenue  unearned revenue is comprised of the following items:  volume licensing programs \u0096 represents customer billings for multi-year licensing arrangements, paid either upfront or annually at the beginning of each billing coverage period, which are accounted for as subscriptions with revenue recognized ratably over the billing coverage period.  \u00a0 \u00a0  table of contents  \u00a0part ii\u00a0  item 8  \u00a0 \u00a0 undelivered elements \u0096 represents free post-delivery telephone support and the right to receive unspecified upgrades/enhancements of microsoft internet explorer on a when-and-if-available basis. this revenue deferral is applicable for windows xp and prior versions shipped as retail packaged products, products licensed to oems, and perpetual licenses for current products under our open and select volume licensing programs. the amount recorded as unearned is based on the sales price of those elements when sold separately and is recognized ratably on a straight-line basis over the related product\u0092s life cycle. the percentage of revenue recorded as unearned due to undelivered elements ranges from approximately 15% to 25% of the sales price for windows xp home and approximately 5% to 15% of the sales price for windows xp professional, depending on the terms and conditions of the license and prices of the elements. product life cycles are currently estimated at three and one-half years for windows operating systems.  other \u0096 represents payments for post-delivery support and consulting services to be performed in the future, online advertising for which the advertisement has yet to be displayed, microsoft dynamics business solutions products, xbox live subscriptions, mediaroom, and other offerings for which we have been paid upfront and earn the revenue when we provide the service or software, or otherwise meet the revenue recognition criteria.  the components of unearned revenue were as follows:  \u00a0 unearned revenue by segment was as follows:  \u00a0 note 13\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0other long-term liabilities  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0    table of contents  \u00a0part ii\u00a0  item 8  \u00a0 \u00a0 note 14\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0commitments and guarantees  we have committed $1.2 billion for constructing new buildings as of june\u00a030, 2008.  we have operating leases for most u.s. and international sales and support offices and certain equipment. rental expense for operating leases was $398 million, $325 million, and $271 million, in fiscal years 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively. future minimum rental commitments under noncancellable leases are as follows:  \u00a0 we provide indemnifications of varying scope and size to certain customers against claims of intellectual property infringement made by third parties arising from the use of our products. in addition, we also provide indemnification against credit risk in several geographical locations to our volume license resellers in case the resellers fail to collect from the end user. due to the nature of the indemnification provided to our resellers, we cannot estimate the fair value, nor determine the total nominal amount, of the indemnification. we evaluate estimated losses for these indemnifications under sfas no.\u00a05, accounting for contingencies, as interpreted by fin no.\u00a045, guarantor\u0092s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees, including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others. we consider such factors as the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss. to date, we have not encountered material costs as a result of these obligations and have not accrued any liabilities related to these indemnifications in our financial statements.  product warranty  in july 2007, we announced the expansion of our global xbox 360 warranty coverage to three years from the date of purchase for a general hardware failure indicated by three flashing red lights. the basic xbox 360 console warranty remains in place with a warranty period of one year from the date of purchase in most geographies.  the changes in our aggregate product warranty liabilities, which are included in other current liabilities and other long term-liabilities on our balance sheets, were as follows:  \u00a0 accruals for warranties issued during fiscal year 2007 included charges incurred as a result of the expansion of our xbox 360 warranty coverage as discussed above.  \u00a0 \u00a0  table of contents  \u00a0part ii\u00a0  item 8  \u00a0 \u00a0 note 15\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0contingencies  government competition law matters.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0in march\u00a02004, the european commission issued a competition law decision that, among other things, ordered us to license certain windows server protocol technology to our competitors. in march\u00a02007, the european commission issued a statement of objections claiming that the pricing terms we proposed for licensing the technology as required by\u00a0the march 2004 decision were \u0093not reasonable.\u0094 following additional steps we took to address these concerns, the commission announced on october\u00a022, 2007 that we were in compliance with the march 2004 decision and that no further penalty should accrue after that date. on february\u00a027, 2008, the commission issued a fine of $1.4 billion (\u0080899 million) relating to the period prior to october\u00a022, 2007. in january 2008, the commission announced that it was opening two new competition law investigations. these investigations relate primarily to interoperability with respect to our microsoft office family of products and the inclusion of various capabilities in our windows operating system software, including web browsing software. these investigations were precipitated by complaints filed with the commission by a trade association of microsoft\u0092s competitors and a firm that offers web browsing software. in may 2008, we filed an application with the european court of first instance to annul the february\u00a02008 fine. we paid the $1.4 billion (\u0080899 million) fine in june 2008.  we are subject to a consent decree and final judgment that resolved lawsuits brought by the u.s. department of justice, 18 states, and the district of columbia in two separate actions. the consent decree imposed various constraints on our windows operating system businesses. portions of the consent decree were scheduled to expire on january\u00a031, 2008; we voluntarily agreed to extend other elements of the consent decree to november 2009. in october\u00a02007, some states filed a motion with the u.s. district court for the district of columbia seeking to have most of the remaining provisions of the final judgment in the action to which they are party extended for five years. the u.s. department of justice and other states advised the court that they would not seek any extension of the final judgments to which they are party. in january 2008, the court issued a decision granting the states\u0092 motion to extend these additional provisions of the consent decree until november 2009.  in other ongoing investigations, various foreign governments and several state attorneys general have requested information from us concerning competition, privacy, and security issues.  antitrust, unfair competition, and overcharge class actions.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0a large number of antitrust and unfair competition class action lawsuits have been filed against us in various state, federal, and canadian courts on behalf of various classes of direct and indirect purchasers of our pc operating system and certain other software products. we obtained dismissals of damages claims of indirect purchasers under federal law and in 15 states. courts refused to certify classes in two additional states. we have reached agreements to settle all claims that have been made to date in 19 states and the district of columbia.  under the settlements, generally class members can obtain vouchers that entitle them to be reimbursed for purchases of a wide variety of platform-neutral computer hardware and software. the total value of vouchers that we may issue varies by state. we will make available to certain schools a percentage of those vouchers that are not issued or claimed (one-half to two-thirds depending on the state). the total value of vouchers we ultimately issue will depend on the number of class members who make claims and are issued vouchers. the maximum value of vouchers to be issued is approximately $2.7 billion. the actual costs of these settlements will be less than that maximum amount, depending on the number of class members and schools that are issued and redeem vouchers.  the settlements in all states have received final court approval. cases in arizona, mississippi and canada have not been settled. we estimate the total cost to resolve all of these cases will range between $1.7 billion and $1.9 billion. the actual cost depends on factors such as the quantity and mix of products for which claims will be made, the number of eligible class members who ultimately use the vouchers, the nature of hardware and software that is acquired using the vouchers, and the cost of administering the claims. at june\u00a030, 2008, we have recorded a liability related to these claims of approximately $900 million, which reflects our estimated exposure of $1.7 billion less payments made to date of approximately $800 million, mostly for administrative expenses, vouchers, and legal fees.  other antitrust litigation and claims.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0in november 2004, novell, inc. filed a complaint in u.s. district court in utah, now transferred with other cases to maryland, asserting antitrust and unfair competition claims against us related to novell\u0092s ownership of wordperfect and other productivity applications during the period between june 1994 and march 1996. in june\u00a02005, the trial court granted our motion to dismiss four of six claims of the complaint. both parties appealed, and in october 2007, the court of appeals affirmed the decision of the trial court, remanding the case to that court for further proceedings.  \u00a0 \u00a0    table of contents  \u00a0part ii\u00a0  item 8  \u00a0 \u00a0 patent and intellectual property claims.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0we are vigorously defending more than 45 patent infringement cases. microsoft and alcatel-lucent are parties to a number of legal proceedings relating to certain patents of each of the companies. some of these actions began before the merger of alcatel and lucent in 2006. for simplicity, we refer to the post-merger entity as alcatel-lucent throughout this discussion.  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 the actual costs to resolve these cases will depend upon many factors such as the outcome of post-trial motions, any appeals, and the results of the remaining trials. adverse outcomes in some or all of the matters described in this section may result in significant monetary damages or injunctive relief against us that would adversely affect distribution of our operating system or application products. we may enter into material settlements because of these risks.  other.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0we are also subject to a variety of other claims and suits that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of our business. although management currently believes that resolving claims against us, individually or in aggregate, will not have a material adverse impact on our financial position, our results of operations, or our cash flows, these matters are subject to inherent uncertainties and management\u0092s view of these matters may change in the future.  as of june\u00a030, 2008, we had accrued aggregate liabilities of approximately $600 million in other current liabilities and approximately $500 million in other long-term liabilities for all of the contingent matters described in this note. while we intend to vigorously defend these matters, there exists the possibility of adverse outcomes that we   \u00a0 \u00a0  table of contents  \u00a0part ii\u00a0  item 8  \u00a0 \u00a0  estimate could be up to $2.2 billion in aggregate beyond recorded amounts. were unfavorable final outcomes to occur, there exists the possibility of a material adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows for the period in which the effects become reasonably estimable.  note 16\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0stockholders\u0092 equity  shares of common stock outstanding were as follows:  \u00a0 on july\u00a020, 2006, we announced the completion of the repurchase program initially approved by our board of directors on july\u00a020, 2004 to buy back up to $30.0 billion in microsoft common stock.  on july\u00a020, 2006, we also announced that our board of directors authorized two new share repurchase programs: a $20.0 billion tender offer, which was completed on august\u00a017, 2006; and authorization for up to an additional $20.0 billion ongoing share repurchase program with an expiration of june\u00a030, 2011. under the tender offer, we repurchased approximately 155\u00a0million shares of common stock, or 1.5% of our common shares outstanding, for approximately $3.8 billion at a price per share of $24.75. on august\u00a018, 2006, we announced that the authorization for the $20.0 billion ongoing share repurchase program had been increased by approximately $16.2\u00a0billion. as a result, we were authorized to repurchase additional shares in an amount up to $36.2 billion through june\u00a030, 2011. as of june\u00a030, 2008, approximately $2.7 billion remained of the $36.2 billion approved repurchase amount. under these repurchase plans, we have made the following share repurchases:  \u00a0

have an employee stock purchase plan for all eligible employees. compensation expense for the employee stock purchase plan is recognized in accordance with sfas no.\u00a0123(r). shares of our common stock may be purchased by employees at three-month intervals at 90% of the fair market value on the last day of each three-month period. employees may purchase shares having a value not exceeding 15% of their gross compensation during an offering period. employees purchased the following shares:  \u00a0 at june\u00a030, 2008, 107\u00a0million shares were reserved for future issuance.  savings plan.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0we have a savings plan in the united states that qualifies under section\u00a0401(k) of the internal revenue code, and a number of savings plans in international locations. participating u.s. employees may contribute up to 50% of their salary, but not more than statutory limits. we contribute fifty cents for each dollar a participant contributes in this plan, with a maximum contribution of 3% of a participant\u0092s earnings. matching contributions for all plans were $238 million, $218 million, and $178 million in fiscal years 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively. matching contributions are invested proportionate to each participant\u0092s voluntary contributions in the investment options provided under the plan. investment options in the u.s. plan include microsoft common stock, but neither participant nor our matching contributions are required to be invested in microsoft common stock.  stock plans.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0we have stock plans for directors and for officers, employees, consultants, and advisors. at june\u00a030, 2008, an aggregate of 786\u00a0million shares were authorized for future grant under our stock plans, which cover stock options, stock awards, and shared performance stock awards. awards that expire or are canceled without delivery of shares generally become available for issuance under the plans. we issue new shares to satisfy stock option exercises.  stock awards and shared performance stock awards.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0stock awards (\u0093sas\u0094) are grants that entitle the holder to shares of common stock as the award vests. our sas generally vest over a five-year period.  shared performance stock awards (\u0093spsas\u0094) are a form of sa in which the number of shares ultimately received depends on our business performance against specified performance targets. the performance period for spsas issued in fiscal years 2004, 2005, and 2006 was july\u00a01, 2003 through june\u00a030, 2006 (january\u00a01, 2004 through june\u00a030, 2006 for certain executive officers). following the end of the performance period, the compensation committee of the board of directors determined that the number of shares of sas to be issued was 37\u00a0million, based on the actual performance against metrics established for the performance period. one-third of the awards vested in each of the fiscal years 2007 and 2008. an additional one-third of the awards will vest in fiscal year 2009. because the spsas covered a three-year period, spsas issued in fiscal year 2006 were given only to newly hired and promoted employees eligible to receive spsas.  the company granted spsas for fiscal years 2007 and 2008 with performance periods of july\u00a01, 2006 through june\u00a030, 2007 and july\u00a01, 2007 through june\u00a030, 2008, respectively. at the end of the fiscal year performance period, the number of shares of stock subject to the award is determined by multiplying the target award by a percentage ranging from 0% to 150%. the percentage is based on performance metrics for the performance period, as determined by the compensation committee of the board of directors in its sole discretion. an additional number of shares, approximately 15% of the total target spsas, are available as additional awards to participants based on individual performance. one-quarter of the shares of stock subject to each award vest following the end of the   \u00a0 \u00a0    table of contents  \u00a0part ii\u00a0  item 8  \u00a0 \u00a0  performance period, and an additional one-quarter of the shares vest over each of the following three years. following the end of the fiscal year 2007 performance period, the compensation committee of the board of directors determined that the number of shares of sas to be issued was 11\u00a0million, based on the actual performance against metrics established for the performance period. the number of shares of sas to be issued for the fiscal year 2008 performance period will be determined in the first quarter of fiscal year 2009.  we measure the fair value of sas and spsas based upon the market price of the underlying common stock as of the date of grant, reduced by the present value of estimated future dividends. sas and spsas are amortized over their applicable vesting period (generally three to five years) using the straight-line method. the fair value of each award grant is estimated on the date of grant using the following assumptions:  \u00a0 during fiscal year 2008, the following activity occurred under our existing plans:  \u00a0 as of june\u00a030, 2008, there was $3.2 billion and $586 million of total unrecognized compensation costs related to sas and spsas, respectively. these costs are expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 3.4 years and 2.8 years, respectively.  spsas granted in fiscal year 2008 include adjustments for estimated performance against performance targets.  during fiscal year 2007 and 2006, the following activity occurred under our plans:  \u00a0 stock options.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0in fiscal year 2004, we began granting employees sas rather than stock options as part of our equity compensation plans. since then, stock options issued to employees have been issued primarily in conjunction with business acquisitions. nonqualified stock options were granted to our directors under our non-employee director   \u00a0 \u00a0  table of contents  \u00a0part ii\u00a0  item 8  \u00a0 \u00a0  stock plan. nonqualified and incentive stock options were granted to certain officers and employees under our employee stock plans. options granted between 1995 and 2001 generally vest over four and one-half years and expire seven years from the date of grant, while certain options vest either over four and one-half years or over seven and one-half years and expire ten years from the date of grant. options granted after 2001 vest over four and one-half years and expire ten years from the date of grant. approximately ten\u00a0million, two million, and one million stock options were granted in conjunction with business acquisitions during fiscal years 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively.  employee stock options outstanding were as follows:  \u00a0 options outstanding as of june\u00a030, 2008 include approximately 12\u00a0million options that were granted in conjunction with business acquisitions. while these options are included in the options outstanding balance, they are excluded from the weighted average exercise price of $28.12 presented. these options have an exercise price range of $0 to $150.93 and a weighted average exercise price of $9.03.  during fiscal years 2008, 2007, and 2006 the following activity occurred under our plans:  \u00a0 cash received and income tax benefits from stock option exercises were $3.0 billion and $365 million, respectively, for fiscal year 2008.  note 19\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0segment information  segment revenue and operating income (loss) was as follows:  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0    table of contents  \u00a0part ii\u00a0  item 8  \u00a0 \u00a0 sfas no.\u00a0131, disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information, establishes standards for reporting information about operating segments. this standard requires segmentation based on our internal organization and reporting of revenue and operating income based upon internal accounting methods. our financial reporting systems present various data for management to operate the business, including internal profit and loss statements prepared on a basis not consistent with u.s. gaap. the segments are designed to allocate resources internally and provide a framework to determine management responsibility. amounts for prior periods have been recast to conform to the current management view. operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise about which separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker, or decision making group, in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance. our chief operating decision maker is our chief executive officer. our five segments are client; server and tools; online services business; microsoft business division; and entertainment and devices division.  the types of products and services provided by each segment are summarized below:  client \u0096 windows vista, including home, home premium, ultimate, business, enterprise and starter edition; windows xp professional and home; media center edition; tablet pc edition; and other standard windows operating systems.  server and tools \u0096 windows server operating system; microsoft sql server; microsoft enterprise services; product support services; visual studio; system center products; forefront security products; biz talk server; msdn; and other products and services.  online services business \u0096 live search; msn; mappoint; msn internet access; msn premium web services (consisting of msn internet software subscription, msn hotmail plus, and msn software services); windows live; msn mobile services; avenuea razorfish media agency services; atlas online tools for advertisers; and the drive pm ad network for publishers.  microsoft business division \u0096 microsoft office; microsoft project; microsoft

microsoft office communication server; microsoft office communicator; microsoft tellme service, microsoft dynamics ax; microsoft dynamics crm; microsoft dynamics crm online; microsoft dynamics gp; microsoft dynamics nav; microsoft dynamics sl; microsoft dynamics retail management system; microsoft partner program; and microsoft office accounting.  entertainment and devices division \u0096 xbox 360 console and games; xbox live; zune; mediaroom; numerous consumer software and hardware products (such as mice and keyboards); windows mobile software and services platform; windows embedded device operating system; windows automotive; and surface computing platform.  because of our integrated business structure, operating costs included in one segment may benefit other segments, and therefore these segments are not designed to measure operating income or loss directly related to the products included in each segment. inter-segment cost commissions are estimated by management and used to compensate or charge each segment for such shared costs and to incent shared efforts. management will continually   \u00a0 \u00a0  table of contents  \u00a0part ii\u00a0  item 8  \u00a0 \u00a0  evaluate the alignment of product development organizations, sales organizations, and inter-segment commissions for segment reporting purposes, which may result in changes to segment allocations in future periods.  assets are not allocated to segments for internal reporting presentations. a portion of amortization and depreciation is included with various other costs in an overhead allocation to each segment and it is impracticable for us to separately identify the amount of amortization and depreciation by segment that is included in the measure of segment profit or loss.  reconciling amounts include adjustments to conform with u.s. gaap and corporate-level activity not specifically attributed to a segment. significant internal accounting policies that differ from u.s. gaap relate

the financial position of microsoft corporation and subsidiaries as of june\u00a030, 2008 and 2007, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period

chief executive officer and chief financial officer have concluded that these disclosure controls and procedures are effective.  report of management on internal control over financial reporting  our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for the company. internal control over financial reporting is a process to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america. internal control over financial reporting includes maintaining records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect our transactions; providing reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary for preparation of our financial statements; providing reasonable assurance that receipts and expenditures of company assets are made in accordance with management authorization; and providing reasonable assurance that unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of company assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements would be prevented or detected on a timely basis. because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting is not intended to provide absolute assurance that a misstatement of our financial statements would be prevented or detected.  management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in internal control \u0096 integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission. based on this evaluation, management concluded that the company\u0092s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of june\u00a030, 2008. there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended june\u00a030, 2008 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. deloitte\u00a0& touche llp has audited our internal control over financial reporting as of june\u00a030, 2008; their report

stockholders of microsoft corporation:  we have audited the internal control over financial reporting of microsoft corporation and subsidiaries (the \u0093company\u0094) as of june\u00a030, 2008, based on criteria established in internal control \u0096 integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission.\u00a0the company\u0092s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying report of management on internal control over financial reporting.\u00a0our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company\u0092s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.  we conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board (united states).\u00a0those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\u00a0our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.\u00a0we believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.  a company\u0092s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company\u0092s principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the company\u0092s board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.\u00a0a company\u0092s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1)\u00a0pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2)\u00a0provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3)\u00a0provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company\u0092s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.  because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.\u00a0also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.  in our opinion, the company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of june\u00a030, 2008, based on the criteria established in internal control \u0096 integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission.  we have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board (united states), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended june\u00a030, 2008 of the company and our report dated july\u00a031, 2008 expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements and included an explanatory paragraph regarding the company\u0092s adoption of financial accounting standards board interpretation no.\u00a048, accounting for uncertainty in income taxes \u0096 an interpretation of fasb statement no.\u00a0109 and emerging issues task force issue no.\u00a006-2, accounting for sabbatical leave and other similar benefits pursuant to fasb statement no.\u00a043.

variety of business models. \u2022even as we transition more of our business to infrastructure-, platform-, and software-as-a-service business model, the license-based proprietary software model generates a substantial portion of our software revenue. we bear the costs of converting original ideas into software products through investments in research and development, offsetting these costs with the revenue received from licensing our products. many of our competitors also develop and sell software to businesses and consumers under this model. \u2022we are investing in artificial intelligence (\u201cai\u201d) across the entire company and infusing generative ai capabilities into our consumer and commercial offerings. we expect ai technology and services to be a highly competitive and rapidly evolving market. we will bear significant development and operational costs to build and support the ai capabilities, products, and services necessary to meet the needs of our customers. to compete effectively we must also be responsive to technological change, potential regulatory developments, and public scrutiny. \u2022other competitors develop and offer free applications, online services, and content, and make money by selling third-party advertising. advertising revenue funds development of products and services these competitors provide to users at no or little cost, competing directly with our revenue-generating products. \u2022some companies compete with us by modifying and then distributing open source software at little or no cost to end users, using open source ai models, and earning revenue on advertising or integrated products and services. these firms do not bear the full costs of research and development for the open source products. some open source products mimic the features and functionality of our products. the competitive pressures described above may cause decreased sales volumes, price reductions, and/or increased operating costs, such as for research and development, marketing, and sales incentives. this may lead to lower revenue, gross margins, and operating income. our increasing focus on cloud-based services presents execution and competitive risks. a growing part of our business involves cloud-based services available across the spectrum of computing devices. our strategic vision is to compete and grow by building best-in-class platforms and productivity services that utilize ubiquitous computing and ambient intelligence to drive insights and productivity gains. at the same time, our competitors are rapidly developing and deploying cloud-based services for consumers and business customers. pricing and delivery models are evolving. devices and form factors influence how users access services in the cloud and sometimes the user\u2019s choice of which cloud-based services to use. certain industries and customers have specific requirements for cloud services and may present enhanced risks. we are devoting significant resources to develop and deploy our cloud-based strategies. the windows ecosystem must continue to evolve with this changing environment. we embrace cultural and organizational changes to drive accountability and eliminate obstacles to innovation. our intelligent cloud and intelligent edge offerings are connected to the growth of the internet of things (\u201ciot\u201d), a network of distributed and interconnected devices employing sensors, data, and computing capabilities, including ai. our success in driving ubiquitous computing and ambient intelligence will depend on the level of adoption of our offerings such as azure, azure ai, and azure iot edge. we may not establish market share sufficient to achieve scale necessary to meet our business objectives. besides software development costs, we are incurring costs to build and maintain infrastructure to support cloud computing services. these costs will reduce the operating margins we have previously achieved. whether we succeed in cloud-based services depends on our execution in several areas, including: \u2022continuing to bring to market compelling cloud-based experiences that generate increasing traffic and market share. \u2022maintaining the utility, compatibility, and performance of our cloud-based services on the growing array of computing devices, including pcs, smartphones, tablets, gaming consoles, and other devices, as well as sensors and other iot endpoints. \u2022continuing to enhance the attractiveness of our cloud platforms to third-party developers. \u2022ensuring our cloud-based services meet the reliability expectations of our customers and maintain the security of their data as well as help them meet their own compliance needs. \u2022making our suite of cloud-based services platform-agnostic, available on a wide range of devices and ecosystems, including those of our competitors. 24part i item 1a \u00a0 it is uncertain whether our strategies will attract the users or generate the revenue required to succeed. if we are not effective in executing organizational and technical changes to increase efficiency and accelerate innovation, or if we fail to generate sufficient usage of our new products and services, we may not grow revenue in line with the infrastructure and development investments described above. this may negatively impact gross margins and operating income. some users may engage in fraudulent or abusive activities through our cloud-based services. these include unauthorized use of accounts through stolen credentials, use of stolen credit cards or other payment vehicles, failure to pay for services accessed, or other activities that violate our terms of service such as cryptocurrency mining or launching cyberattacks. if our efforts to detect such violations or our actions to control these types of fraud and abuse are not effective, we may experience adverse impacts to our revenue or incur reputational damage. risks relating to the evolution of our business we make significant investments in products and services that may not achieve expected returns. we will continue to make significant investments in research, development, and marketing for existing products, services, and technologies, including the windows operating system, microsoft 365, bing, sql server, windows server, azure, office 365, xbox, linkedin, and other products and services. in addition, we are focused on developing new ai platform services and incorporating ai into existing products and services. we also invest in the development and acquisition of a variety of hardware for productivity, communication, and entertainment, including pcs, tablets, gaming devices, and hololens. investments in new technology are speculative. commercial success depends on many factors, including innovativeness, developer support, and effective distribution and marketing. if customers do not perceive our latest offerings as providing significant new functionality or other value, they may reduce their purchases of new software and hardware products or upgrades, unfavorably affecting revenue. we may not achieve significant revenue from new product, service, and distribution channel investments for several years, if at all. new products and services may not be profitable, and even if they are profitable, operating margins for some new products and businesses will not be as high as the margins we have experienced historically. we may not get engagement in certain features, like  microsoft edge, bing, and bing chat, that drive post-sale monetization opportunities. our data handling practices across our products and services will continue to be under scrutiny. perceptions of mismanagement, driven by regulatory activity or negative public reaction to our practices or product experiences, could negatively impact product and feature adoption, product design, and product quality. developing new technologies is complex. it can require long development and testing periods. significant delays in new releases or significant problems in creating new products or services could adversely affect our revenue. acquisitions, joint ventures, and strategic alliances may have an adverse effect on our business. we expect to continue making acquisitions and entering into joint ventures and strategic alliances as part of our long-term business strategy. for example, in march 2021 we completed our acquisition of zenimax media inc. for $8.1 billion, and in march 2022 we completed our acquisition of nuance communications, inc. for $18.8 billion. in january 2022 we announced a definitive agreement to acquire activision blizzard, inc. for $68.7 billion. in january 2023 we announced the third phase of our openai strategic partnership. acquisitions and other transactions and arrangements involve significant challenges and risks, including that they do not advance our business strategy, that we get an unsatisfactory return on our investment, that they raise new compliance-related obligations and challenges, that we have difficulty integrating and retaining new employees, business systems, and technology, that they distract management from our other businesses, or that announced transactions may not be completed. if an arrangement fails to adequately anticipate changing circumstances and interests of a party, it may result in early termination or renegotiation of the arrangement. the success of these transactions and arrangements will depend in part on our ability to leverage them to enhance our existing products and services or develop compelling new ones, as well as acquired companies\u2019 ability to meet our policies and processes in areas such as data governance, privacy, and cybersecurity. it may take longer than expected to realize the full benefits from these transactions and arrangements such as increased revenue or enhanced efficiencies, or the benefits may ultimately be smaller than we expected. these events could adversely affect our consolidated financial statements. 25part i item 1a \u00a0 if our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets become impaired, we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings. we acquire other companies and intangible assets and may not realize all the economic benefit from those acquisitions, which could cause an impairment of goodwill or intangibles. we review our amortizable intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. we test goodwill for impairment at least annually. factors that may be a change in circumstances, indicating that the carrying value of our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets may not be recoverable, include a decline in our stock price and market capitalization, reduced future cash flow estimates, and slower growth rates in industry segments in which we participate. we have in the past recorded, and may in the future be required to record, a significant charge in our consolidated financial statements during the period in which any impairment of our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets is determined, negatively affecting our results of operations. cybersecurity, data privacy, and platform abuse risks cyberattacks and security vulnerabilities could lead to reduced revenue, increased costs, liability claims, or harm to our reputation or competitive position. security of our information technology threats to it security can take a variety of forms. individual and groups of hackers and sophisticated organizations, including state-sponsored organizations or nation-states, continuously undertake attacks that pose threats to our customers and our it. these actors may use a wide variety of methods, which may include developing and deploying malicious software or exploiting vulnerabilities or intentionally designed processes  in hardware, software, or other infrastructure in order to attack our products and services or gain access to our networks and datacenters, using social engineering techniques to induce our employees, users, partners, or customers to disclose passwords or other sensitive information or take other actions to gain access to our data or our users\u2019 or customers\u2019 data, or acting in a coordinated manner to launch distributed denial of service or other coordinated attacks. nation-state and state-sponsored actors can deploy significant resources to plan and carry out attacks. nation-state attacks against us, our customers, or our partners may intensify during periods of intense diplomatic or armed conflict, such as the ongoing conflict in ukraine. inadequate account security or organizational security practices may also result in unauthorized access to confidential data. for example, system administrators may fail to timely remove employee account access when no longer appropriate. employees or third parties may intentionally compromise our or our users\u2019 security or systems or reveal confidential information. malicious actors may employ the it supply chain to introduce malware through software updates or compromised supplier accounts or hardware. cyberthreats are constantly evolving and becoming increasingly sophisticated and complex, increasing the difficulty of detecting and successfully defending against them. we may have no current capability to detect certain vulnerabilities or new attack methods, which may allow them to persist in the environment over long periods of time. cyberthreats can have cascading impacts that unfold with increasing speed across our internal networks and systems and those of our partners and customers. breaches of our facilities, network, or data security could disrupt the security of our systems and business applications, impair our ability to provide services to our customers and protect the privacy of their data, result in product development delays, compromise confidential or technical business information harming our reputation or competitive position, result in theft or misuse of our intellectual property or other assets, subject us to ransomware attacks, require us to allocate more resources to improve technologies or remediate the impacts of attacks, or otherwise adversely affect our business. we are also subject to supply chain cyberattacks where malware can be introduced to a software provider\u2019s customers, including us, through software updates. in addition, our internal it environment continues to evolve. often, we are early adopters of new devices and technologies. we embrace new ways of sharing data and communicating internally and with partners and customers using methods such as social networking and other consumer-oriented technologies. increasing use of generative ai models in our internal systems may create new attack methods for adversaries. our business policies and internal security controls may not keep pace with these changes as new threats emerge, or emerging cybersecurity regulations in jurisdictions worldwide. 26part i item 1a \u00a0 security of our products, services, devices, and customers\u2019 data the security of our products and services is important in our customers\u2019 decisions to purchase or use our products or services across cloud and on-premises environments. security threats are a significant challenge to companies like us whose business is providing technology products and services to others. threats to our own it infrastructure can also affect our customers. customers using our cloud-based services rely on the security of our infrastructure, including hardware and other elements provided by third parties, to ensure the reliability of our services and the protection of their data. adversaries tend to focus their efforts on the most popular operating systems, programs, and services, including many of ours, and we expect that to continue. in addition, adversaries can attack our customers\u2019 on-premises or cloud environments, sometimes exploiting previously unknown (\u201czero day\u201d) vulnerabilities, such as occurred in early calendar year 2021 with several of our exchange server on-premises products. vulnerabilities in these or any product can persist even after we have issued security patches if customers have not installed the most recent updates, or if the attackers exploited the vulnerabilities before patching to install additional malware to further compromise customers\u2019 systems. adversaries will continue to attack customers using our cloud services as customers embrace digital transformation. adversaries that acquire user account information can use that information to compromise our users\u2019 accounts, including where accounts share the same attributes such as passwords. inadequate account security practices may also result in unauthorized access, and user activity may result in ransomware or other malicious software impacting a customer\u2019s use of our products or services. we are increasingly incorporating open source software into our products. there may be vulnerabilities in open source software that may make our products susceptible to cyberattacks. additionally, we are actively adding new generative ai features to our services. because generative ai is a new field, understanding of security risks and protection methods continues to develop; features that rely on generative ai may be susceptible to unanticipated security threats from sophisticated adversaries. our customers operate complex it systems with third-party hardware and software from multiple vendors that may include systems acquired over many years. they expect our products and services to support all these systems and products, including those that no longer incorporate the strongest current security advances or standards. as a result, we may not be able to discontinue support in our services for a product, service, standard, or feature solely because a more secure alternative is available. failure to utilize the most current security advances and standards can increase our customers\u2019 vulnerability to attack. further, customers of widely varied size and technical sophistication use our technology, and consequently may still have limited capabilities and resources to help them adopt and implement state of the art cybersecurity practices and technologies. in addition, we must account for this wide variation of technical sophistication when defining default settings for our products and services, including security default settings, as these settings may limit or otherwise impact other aspects of it operations and some customers may have limited capability to review and reset these defaults. cyberattacks may adversely impact our customers even if our production services are not directly compromised. we are committed to notifying our customers whose systems have been impacted as we become aware and have actionable information for customers to help protect themselves. we are also committed to providing guidance and support on detection, tracking, and remediation. we may not be able to detect the existence or extent of these attacks for all of our customers or have information on how to detect or track an attack, especially where an attack involves on-premises software such as exchange server where we may have no or limited visibility into our customers\u2019 computing environments. development and deployment of defensive measures to defend against security threats to our internal it systems, our cloud-based services, and our customers\u2019 systems, we must continuously engineer more secure products and services, enhance security, threat detection, and reliability features, improve the deployment of software updates to address security vulnerabilities in our own products as well as those provided by others, develop mitigation technologies that help to secure customers from attacks even when software updates are not deployed, maintain the digital security infrastructure that protects the integrity of our network, products, and services, and provide security tools such as firewalls, anti-virus software, and advanced security and information about the need to deploy security measures and the impact of doing so. customers in certain industries such as financial services, health care, and government may have enhanced or specialized requirements to which we must engineer our products and services. 27part i item 1a \u00a0 the cost of measures to protect products and customer-facing services could reduce our operating margins. if we fail to do these things well, actual or perceived security vulnerabilities in our products and services, data corruption issues, or reduced performance could harm our reputation and lead customers to reduce or delay future purchases of products or subscriptions to services, or to use competing products or services. customers may also spend more on protecting their existing computer systems from attack, which could delay adoption of additional products or services. customers, and third parties granted access to their systems, may fail to update their systems, continue to run software or operating systems we no longer support, or may fail timely to install or enable security patches, or may otherwise fail to adopt adequate security practices. any of these could adversely affect our reputation and revenue. actual or perceived vulnerabilities may lead to claims against us. our license agreements typically contain provisions that eliminate or limit our exposure to liability, but there is no assurance these provisions will withstand legal challenges. at times, to achieve commercial objectives, we may enter into agreements with larger liability exposure to customers. our products operate in conjunction with and are dependent on products and components across a broad ecosystem of third parties. if there is a security vulnerability in one of these components, and if there is a security exploit targeting it, we could face increased costs, liability claims, reduced revenue, or harm to our reputation or competitive position. disclosure and misuse of personal data could result in liability and harm our reputation. as we continue to grow the number, breadth, and scale of our cloud-based offerings, we store and process increasingly large amounts of personal data of our customers and users. the continued occurrence of high-profile data breaches provides evidence of an external environment increasingly hostile to information security. despite our efforts to improve the security controls across our business groups and geographies, it is possible our security controls over personal data, our training of employees and third parties on data security, and other practices we follow may not prevent the improper disclosure or misuse of customer or user data we or our vendors store and manage. in addition, third parties who have limited access to our customer or user data may use this data in unauthorized ways. improper disclosure or misuse could harm our reputation, lead to legal exposure to customers or users, or subject us to liability under laws that protect personal data, resulting in increased costs or loss of revenue. our software products and services also enable our customers and users to store and process personal data on-premises or, increasingly, in a cloud-based environment we host. government authorities can sometimes require us to produce customer or user data in response to valid legal orders. in the u.s. and elsewhere, we advocate for transparency concerning these requests and appropriate limitations on government authority to compel disclosure. despite our efforts to protect customer and user data, perceptions that the collection, use, and retention of personal information is not satisfactorily protected could inhibit sales of our products or services and could limit adoption of our cloud-based solutions by consumers, businesses, and government entities. additional security measures we may take to address customer or user concerns, or constraints on our flexibility to determine where and how to operate datacenters in response to customer or user expectations or governmental rules or actions, may cause higher operating expenses or hinder growth of our products and services. we may not be able to protect information in our products and services from use by others. linkedin and other microsoft products and services contain valuable information and content protected by contractual restrictions or technical measures. in certain cases, we have made commitments to our members and users to limit access to or use of this information. changes in the law or interpretations of the law may weaken our ability to prevent third parties from scraping or gathering information or content through use of bots or other measures and using it for their own benefit, thus diminishing the value of our products and services. abuse of our platforms may harm our reputation or user engagement. advertising, professional, marketplace, and gaming platform abuses for platform products and services that provide content or host ads that come from or can be influenced by third parties, including github, linkedin, microsoft advertising, microsoft news, microsoft store, bing, and xbox, our reputation or user engagement may be negatively affected by activity that is hostile or inappropriate. this activity may come from users impersonating other people or organizations including through the use of ai technologies, dissemination of information that may be viewed as misleading or intended to manipulate the opinions of our users, or the use of our products or services that violates our terms of service or otherwise for objectionable or illegal ends. preventing or responding to these actions may require us to make substantial investments in people and technology and these investments may not be successful, adversely affecting our business and consolidated financial statements. 28part i item 1a \u00a0 other digital safety abuses our hosted consumer services as well as our enterprise services may be used to generate or  disseminate harmful or illegal content in violation of our terms or applicable law. we may not proactively discover such content due to scale, the limitations of existing technologies, and conflicting legal frameworks. when discovered by users and others, such content may negatively affect our reputation, our brands, and user engagement. regulations and other initiatives to make platforms responsible for preventing or eliminating harmful content online have been enacted, and we expect this to continue. we may be subject to enhanced regulatory oversight, civil or criminal liability, or reputational damage if we fail to comply with content moderation regulations, adversely affecting our business and consolidated financial statements. the development of the iot presents security, privacy, and execution risks. to support the growth of the intelligent cloud and the intelligent edge, we are developing products, services, and technologies to power the iot.  the iot\u2019s great potential also carries substantial risks. iot products and services may contain defects in design, manufacture, or operation that make them insecure or ineffective for their intended purposes. an iot solution has multiple layers of hardware, sensors, processors, software, and firmware, several of which we may not develop or control. each layer, including the weakest layer, can impact the security of the whole system. many iot devices have limited interfaces and ability to be updated or patched. iot solutions may collect large amounts of data, and our handling of iot data may not satisfy customers or regulatory requirements. iot scenarios may increasingly affect personal health and safety. if iot solutions that include our technologies do not work as intended, violate the law, or harm individuals or businesses, we may be subject to legal claims or enforcement actions. these risks, if realized, may increase our costs, damage our reputation or brands, or negatively impact our revenues or margins. issues in the development and use of ai may result in reputational or competitive harm or liability. we are building ai into many of our offerings, including our productivity services, and we are also making ai available for our customers to use in solutions that they build. this ai may be developed by microsoft or others, including our strategic partner, openai. we expect these elements of our business to grow. we envision a future in which ai operating in our devices, applications, and the cloud helps our customers be more productive in their work and personal lives. as with many innovations, ai presents risks and challenges that could affect its adoption, and therefore our business. ai algorithms or training methodologies may be flawed. datasets may be overbroad, insufficient, or contain biased information. content generated by ai systems may be offensive, illegal, or otherwise harmful. ineffective or inadequate ai development or deployment practices by microsoft or others could result in incidents that impair the acceptance of ai solutions or cause harm to individuals, customers, or society, or result in our products and services not working as intended. human review of certain outputs may be required. as a result of these and other challenges associated with innovative technologies, our implementation of ai systems could subject us to competitive harm, regulatory action, legal liability, including under new proposed legislation regulating ai in jurisdictions such as the european union (\u201ceu\u201d), new applications of existing data protection, privacy, intellectual property, and other laws, and brand or reputational harm. some ai scenarios present ethical issues or may have broad impacts on society. if we enable or offer ai solutions that have unintended consequences, unintended usage or customization by our customers and partners, or are controversial because of their impact on human rights, privacy, employment, or other social, economic, or political issues, we may experience brand or reputational harm, adversely affecting our business and consolidated financial statements. 29part i item 1a \u00a0 operational risks we may have excessive outages, data losses, and disruptions of our online services if we fail to maintain an adequate operations infrastructure. our increasing user traffic, growth in services, and the complexity of our products and services demand more computing power. we spend substantial amounts to build, purchase, or lease datacenters and equipment and to upgrade our technology and network infrastructure to handle more traffic on our websites and in our datacenters. our datacenters depend on the availability of permitted and buildable land,  predictable energy, networking supplies, and servers, including graphics processing units (\u201cgpus\u201d) and other components. the cost or availability of these dependencies could be adversely affected by a variety of factors, including the transition to a clean energy economy, local and regional environmental regulations, and geopolitical disruptions. these demands continue to increase as we introduce new products and services and support the growth and the augmentation of existing services such as bing, azure, microsoft account services, microsoft 365, microsoft teams, dynamics 365, onedrive, sharepoint online, skype, xbox, and outlook.com through the incorporation of ai features and/or functionality. we are rapidly growing our business of providing a platform and back-end hosting for services provided by third parties to their end users. maintaining, securing, and expanding this infrastructure is expensive and complex, and requires development of principles for datacenter builds in geographies with higher safety and reliability risks. it requires that we maintain an internet connectivity infrastructure and storage and compute capacity that is robust and reliable within competitive and regulatory constraints that continue to evolve. inefficiencies or operational failures, including temporary or permanent loss of customer data, insufficient internet connectivity, insufficient or unavailable power supply, or inadequate storage and compute capacity, could diminish the quality of our products, services, and user experience resulting in contractual liability, claims by customers and other third parties, regulatory actions, damage to our reputation, and loss of current and potential users, subscribers, and advertisers, each of which may adversely impact our consolidated financial statements. we may experience quality or supply problems. our hardware products such as xbox consoles, surface devices, and other devices we design and market are highly complex and can have defects in design, manufacture, or associated software. we could incur significant expenses, lost revenue, and reputational harm as a result of recalls, safety alerts, or product liability claims if we fail to prevent, detect, or address such issues through design, testing, or warranty repairs. our software products and services also may experience quality or reliability problems. the highly sophisticated software we develop may contain bugs and other defects that interfere with their intended operation. our customers increasingly rely on us for critical business functions and multiple workloads. many of our products and services are interdependent with one another. each of these circumstances potentially magnifies the impact of quality or reliability issues. any defects we do not detect and fix in pre-release testing could cause reduced sales and revenue, damage to our reputation, repair or remediation costs, delays in the release of new products or versions, or legal liability. although our license agreements typically contain provisions that eliminate or limit our exposure to liability, there is no assurance these provisions will withstand legal challenge. there are limited suppliers for certain device and datacenter components. our competitors use some of the same suppliers and their demand for hardware components can affect the capacity available to us. if components are delayed or become unavailable, whether because of supplier capacity constraint, industry shortages, legal or regulatory changes that restrict supply sources, or other reasons, we may not obtain timely replacement supplies, resulting in reduced sales or inadequate datacenter capacity to support the delivery and continued development of our products and services. component shortages, excess or obsolete inventory, or price reductions resulting in inventory adjustments may increase our cost of revenue. xbox consoles, surface devices, datacenter servers, and other hardware are assembled in asia and other geographies that may be subject to disruptions in the supply chain, resulting in shortages that would affect our revenue and operating margins. legal, regulatory, and litigation risks government litigation and regulatory activity relating to competition rules may limit how we design and market our products. government agencies closely scrutinize us under u.s. and foreign competition laws. governments are actively enforcing competition laws and regulations, and this includes scrutiny in potentially large markets such as the eu, the u.s., and china. some jurisdictions also allow competitors or consumers to assert claims of anti-competitive conduct. u.s. federal and state antitrust authorities have previously brought enforcement actions and continue to scrutinize our business. 30part i item 1a \u00a0 for example, the european commission (\u201cthe commission\u201d) closely scrutinizes the design of high-volume microsoft products and the terms on which we make certain technologies used in these products, such as file formats, programming interfaces, and protocols, available to other companies. flagship product releases such as windows can receive significant scrutiny under eu or other competition laws.  our portfolio of first-party devices continues to grow; at the same time our oem partners offer a large variety of devices for our platforms. as a result, increasingly we both cooperate and compete with our oem partners, creating a risk that we fail to do so in compliance with competition rules. regulatory scrutiny in this area may increase. certain foreign governments, particularly in china and other countries in asia, have advanced arguments under their competition laws that exert downward pressure on royalties for our intellectual property. competition law regulatory actions and court decisions may result in fines or hinder our ability to provide the benefits of our software to consumers and businesses, reducing the attractiveness of our products and the revenue that comes from them. new competition law actions could be initiated, potentially using previous actions as precedent. the outcome of such actions, or steps taken to avoid them, could adversely affect us in a variety of ways, including causing us to withdraw products from or modify products for certain markets, decreasing the value of our assets, adversely affecting our ability to monetize our products, or inhibiting our ability to consummate acquisition or impose conditions on acquisitions that may reduce their value. laws and regulations relating to anti-corruption and trade could result in increased costs, fines, criminal penalties, or reputational damage. the foreign corrupt practices act (\u201cfcpa\u201d) and other anti-corruption laws and regulations (\u201canti-corruption laws\u201d) prohibit corrupt payments by our employees, vendors, or agents, and the accounting provisions of the fcpa require us to maintain accurate books and records and adequate internal controls. from time to time, we receive inquiries from authorities in the u.s. and elsewhere which may be based on reports from employees and others about our business activities outside the u.s. and our compliance with anti-corruption laws. periodically, we receive such reports directly and investigate them, and also cooperate with investigations by u.s. and foreign law enforcement authorities. an example of increasing international regulatory complexity is the eu whistleblower directive, initiated in 2021, which may present compliance challenges to the extent it is implemented in different forms by eu member states. most countries in which we operate also have competition laws that prohibit competitors from colluding or otherwise attempting to reduce competition between themselves. while we devote substantial resources to our u.s. and international compliance programs and have implemented policies, training, and internal controls designed to reduce the risk of corrupt payments and collusive activity, our employees, vendors, or agents may violate our policies. our failure to comply with anti-corruption laws or competition laws could result in significant fines and penalties, criminal sanctions against us, our officers, or our employees, prohibitions on the conduct of our business, and damage to our reputation. increasing trade laws, policies, sanctions, and other regulatory requirements also affect our operations in and outside the u.s. relating to trade and investment. economic sanctions in the u.s., the eu, and other countries prohibit most business with restricted entities or countries. u.s. export controls restrict microsoft from offering many of its products and services to, or making investments in, certain entities in specified countries. u.s. import controls restrict us from integrating certain information and communication technologies into our supply chain and allow for government review of transactions involving information and communications technology from countries determined to be foreign adversaries. supply chain regulations may impact the availability of goods or result in additional regulatory scrutiny. periods of intense diplomatic or armed conflict, such as the ongoing conflict in ukraine, may result in (1) new and rapidly evolving sanctions and trade restrictions, which may impair trade with sanctioned individuals and countries, and (2) negative impacts to regional trade ecosystems among our customers, partners, and us. non-compliance with sanctions as well as general ecosystem disruptions could result in reputational harm, operational delays, monetary fines, loss of revenues, increased costs, loss of export privileges, or criminal sanctions. 31part i item 1a \u00a0 laws and regulations relating to the handling of personal data may impede the adoption of our services or result in increased costs, legal claims, fines against us, or reputational damage. the growth of our internet- and cloud-based services internationally relies increasingly on the movement of data across national boundaries. legal requirements relating to the collection, storage, handling, and transfer of personal data continue to evolve. for example, while the eu-u.s. data privacy framework (\u201cdpf\u201d) has been recognized as adequate under eu law to allow transfers of personal data from the eu to certified companies in the u.s., the dpf is subject to further legal challenge which could cause the legal requirements for data transfers from the eu to be uncertain. eu data protection authorities have and may again block the use of certain u.s.-based services that involve the transfer of data to the u.s. in the eu and other markets, potential new rules and restrictions on the flow of data across borders could increase the cost and complexity of delivering our products and services.  in addition, the eu general data protection regulation (\u201cgdpr\u201d), which applies to all of our activities conducted from an establishment in the eu or related to products and services offered in the eu, imposes a range of compliance obligations regarding the handling of personal data. more recently, the eu has been developing new requirements related to the use of data, including in the digital markets act, the digital services act, and the data act, that add additional rules and restriction on the use of data in our products and services. engineering efforts to build and maintain capabilities to facilitate compliance with these laws involve substantial expense and the diversion of engineering resources from other projects. we might experience reduced demand for our offerings if we are unable to engineer products that meet our legal duties or help our customers meet their obligations under these and other data regulations, or if our implementation to comply makes our offerings less attractive. compliance with these obligations depends in part on how particular regulators interpret and apply them. if we fail to comply, or if regulators assert we have failed to comply (including in response to complaints made by customers), it may lead to regulatory enforcement actions, which can result in significant monetary penalties, private lawsuits, reputational damage, blockage of international data transfers, and loss of customers. the highest fines assessed under gdpr have recently been increasing, especially against large technology companies. jurisdictions around the world, such as china, india, and states in the u.s. have adopted, or are considering adopting or expanding, laws and regulations imposing obligations regarding the collection, handling, and transfer of personal data. our investment in gaining insights from data is becoming central to the value of the services, including ai services, we deliver to customers, to operational efficiency and key opportunities in monetization, and to customer perceptions of quality. our ability to use data in this way may be constrained by regulatory developments that impede realizing the expected return from this investment. ongoing legal analyses, reviews, and inquiries by regulators of microsoft practices, or relevant practices of other organizations, may result in burdensome or inconsistent requirements, including data sovereignty and localization requirements, affecting the location, movement, collection, and use of our customer and internal employee data as well as the management of that data. compliance with applicable laws and regulations regarding personal data may require changes in services, business practices, or internal systems that result in increased costs, lower revenue, reduced efficiency, or greater difficulty in competing with foreign-based firms. compliance with data regulations might limit our ability to innovate or offer certain features and functionality in some jurisdictions where we operate. failure to comply with existing or new rules may result in significant penalties or orders to stop the alleged noncompliant activity, as well as negative publicity and diversion of management time and effort.  existing and increasing legal and regulatory requirements could adversely affect our results of operations. we are subject to a wide range of laws, regulations, and legal requirements in the u.s. and globally, including those that may apply to our products and online services offerings, and those that impose requirements related to user privacy, telecommunications, data storage and protection, advertising, and online content. laws in several jurisdictions, including eu member state laws under the european electronic communications code, increasingly define certain of our services as regulated telecommunications services. this trend may continue and will result in these offerings being subjected to additional data protection, security, law enforcement surveillance, and other obligations. regulators and private litigants may assert that our collection, use, and management of customer data and other information is inconsistent with their laws and regulations, including laws that apply to the tracking of users via technology such as cookies. new environmental, social, and governance laws and regulations are expanding mandatory disclosure, reporting, and diligence requirements. legislative or regulatory action relating to cybersecurity requirements may increase the costs to develop, implement, or secure our products and services. compliance with evolving digital accessibility laws and standards will require engineering and is important to our efforts to empower all people and organizations to achieve more. legislative and regulatory action is emerging in the areas of ai and content moderation, which could increase costs or restrict opportunity. for example, in the eu, an ai act is being considered, and may entail increased costs or decreased opportunities for the operation of our ai services in the european market.  32part i item 1a \u00a0 how these laws and regulations apply to our business is often unclear, subject to change over time, and sometimes may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. in addition, governments\u2019 approach to enforcement, and our products and services, are continuing to evolve. compliance with existing, expanding, or new laws and regulations may involve significant costs or require changes in products or business practices that could adversely affect our results of operations. noncompliance could result in the imposition of penalties or orders we cease the alleged noncompliant activity. in addition, there is increasing pressure from advocacy groups, regulators, competitors, customers, and other stakeholders across many of these areas. if our products do not meet customer expectations or legal requirements, we could lose sales opportunities or face regulatory or legal actions. we have claims and lawsuits against us that may result in adverse outcomes. we are subject to a variety of claims and lawsuits. these claims may arise from a wide variety of business practices and initiatives, including major new product releases such as windows, ai services,  significant business transactions, warranty or product claims,  employment practices, and regulation. adverse outcomes in some or all of these claims may result in significant monetary damages or injunctive relief that could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business. the litigation and other claims are subject to inherent uncertainties and management\u2019s view of these matters may change in the future. a material adverse impact in our consolidated financial statements could occur for the period in which the effect of an unfavorable outcome becomes probable and reasonably estimable. our business with government customers may present additional uncertainties. we derive substantial revenue from government contracts. government contracts generally can present risks and challenges not present in private commercial agreements. for instance, we may be subject to government audits and investigations relating to these contracts, we could be suspended or debarred as a governmental contractor, we could incur civil and criminal fines and penalties, and under certain circumstances contracts may be rescinded. some agreements may allow a government to terminate without cause and provide for higher liability limits for certain losses. some contracts may be subject to periodic funding approval, reductions, cancellations,  or delays which could adversely impact public-sector demand for our products and services. these events could negatively impact our results of operations, financial condition, and reputation. we may have additional tax liabilities. we are subject to income taxes in the u.s. and many foreign jurisdictions. significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes. in the course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. for example, compliance with the 2017 united states tax cuts and jobs act (\u201ctcja\u201d) and possible future legislative changes may require the collection of information not regularly produced within the company, the use of estimates in our consolidated financial statements, and the exercise of significant judgment in accounting for its provisions. as regulations and guidance evolve with respect to the tcja or possible future legislative changes, and as we gather more information and perform more analysis, our results may differ from previous estimates and may materially affect our consolidated financial statements. we are regularly under audit by tax authorities in different jurisdictions. although we believe that our provision for income taxes and our tax estimates are reasonable, tax authorities may disagree with certain positions we have taken. in addition, economic and political pressures to increase tax revenue in various jurisdictions may make resolving tax disputes favorably more difficult. we are currently under internal revenue service audit for prior tax years, with the primary unresolved issues relating to transfer pricing. the final resolution of those audits, and other audits or litigation, may differ from the amounts recorded in our consolidated financial statements and may materially affect our consolidated financial statements in the period or periods in which that determination is made. we earn a significant amount of our operating income outside the u.s. a change in the mix of earnings and losses in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in our business or structure, or the expiration of or disputes about certain tax agreements in a particular country may result in higher effective tax rates for the company. in addition, changes in u.s. federal and state or international tax laws applicable to corporate multinationals, other fundamental law changes currently being considered by many countries, including in the u.s., and changes in taxing jurisdictions\u2019 administrative interpretations, decisions, policies, and positions may materially adversely impact our consolidated financial statements. 33part i item 1a \u00a0 intellectual property risks we face risks related to the protection and utilization of our intellectual property that may result in our business and operating results may be harmed. protecting our intellectual property rights and combating unlicensed copying and use of our software and other intellectual property on a global basis is difficult. similarly, the absence of harmonized patent laws makes it more difficult to ensure consistent respect for patent rights. changes in the law may continue to weaken our ability to prevent the use of patented technology or collect revenue for licensing our patents. additionally, licensees of our patents may fail to satisfy their obligations to pay us royalties or may contest the scope and extent of their obligations. finally, our increasing engagement with open source software will also cause us to license our intellectual property rights broadly in certain situations. if we are unable to protect our intellectual property, our revenue may be adversely affected. source code, the detailed program commands for our operating systems and other software programs, is critical to our business. if our source code leaks, we might lose future trade secret protection for that code. it may then become easier for third parties to compete with our products by copying functionality, which could adversely affect our revenue and operating results. unauthorized disclosure of source code also could increase the security risks described elsewhere in these risk factors. third parties may claim that we infringe their intellectual property. from time to time, others claim we infringe their intellectual property rights. to resolve these claims, we may enter into royalty and licensing agreements on terms that are less favorable than currently available, stop selling or redesign affected products or services, or pay damages to satisfy indemnification commitments with our customers. adverse outcomes could also include monetary damages or injunctive relief that may limit or prevent importing, marketing, and selling our products or services that have infringing technologies. we have paid significant amounts to settle claims related to the use of technology and intellectual property rights and to procure intellectual property rights as part of our strategy to manage this risk, and may continue to do so. general risks if our reputation or our brands are damaged, our business and operating results may be harmed. our reputation and brands are globally recognized and are important to our business. our reputation and brands affect our ability to attract and retain consumer, business, and public-sector customers. there are numerous ways our reputation or brands could be damaged. these include product safety or quality issues, our environmental impact and sustainability, supply chain practices, or human rights record. we may experience backlash from customers, government entities, advocacy groups, employees, and other stakeholders that disagree with our product offering decisions or public policy positions. damage to our reputation or our brands may occur from, among other things:  \u2022the introduction of new features, products, services, or terms of service that customers, users, or partners do not like. \u2022public scrutiny of our decisions regarding user privacy, data practices, or content.  \u2022data security breaches, compliance failures, or actions of partners or individual employees.  the proliferation of social media may increase the likelihood, speed, and magnitude of negative brand events. if our brands or reputation are damaged, it could negatively impact our revenues or margins, or ability to attract the most highly qualified employees. adverse economic or market conditions may harm our business. worsening economic conditions, including inflation, recession, pandemic, or other changes in economic conditions, may cause lower it spending and adversely affect our revenue. if demand for pcs, servers, and other computing devices declines, or consumer or business spending for those products declines, our revenue will be adversely affected.  our product distribution system relies on an extensive partner and retail network. oems building devices that run our software have also been a significant means of distribution. the impact of economic conditions on our partners, such as the bankruptcy of a major distributor, oem, or retailer, could cause sales channel disruption.  challenging economic conditions also may impair the ability of our customers to pay for products and services they have purchased. as a result, allowances for doubtful accounts and write-offs of accounts receivable may increase.  34part i item 1a \u00a0 we maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings, types, and maturities. these investments are subject to general credit, liquidity, market, and interest rate risks, which may be exacerbated by market downturns or events that affect global financial markets. a significant part of our investment portfolio comprises u.s. government securities. if global financial markets decline for long periods, or if there is a downgrade of the u.s. government credit rating due to an actual or threatened default on government debt, our investment portfolio may be adversely affected and we could determine that more of our investments have experienced a decline in fair value, requiring impairment charges that could adversely affect our consolidated financial statements. catastrophic events or geopolitical conditions may disrupt our business. a disruption or failure of our systems or operations because of a major earthquake, weather event, cyberattack, terrorist attack, pandemic, or other catastrophic event could cause delays in completing sales, providing services, or performing other critical functions. our corporate headquarters, a significant portion of our research and development activities, and certain other essential business operations are in the seattle, washington area, and we have other business operations in the silicon valley area of california, both of which are seismically active regions. a catastrophic event that results in the destruction or disruption of any of our critical business or it systems, or the infrastructure or systems they rely on, such as power grids, could harm our ability to conduct normal business operations. providing our customers with more services and solutions in the cloud puts a premium on the resilience of our systems and strength of our business continuity management plans and magnifies the potential impact of prolonged service outages in our consolidated financial statements.  abrupt political change, terrorist activity, and armed conflict, such as the ongoing conflict in ukraine, pose a risk of general economic disruption in affected countries, which may increase our operating costs and negatively impact our ability to sell to and collect from customers in affected markets. these conditions also may add uncertainty to the timing and budget for technology investment decisions by our customers and may cause supply chain disruptions for hardware manufacturers. geopolitical change may result in changing regulatory systems and requirements and market interventions that could impact our operating strategies, access to national, regional, and global markets, hiring, and profitability. geopolitical instability may lead to sanctions and impact our ability to do business in some markets or with some public-sector customers. any of these changes may negatively impact our revenues. the occurrence of regional epidemics or a global pandemic, such as covid-19, may adversely affect our operations, financial condition, and results of operations. the extent to which global pandemics impact our business going forward will depend on factors such as the duration and scope of the pandemic; governmental, business, and individuals' actions in response to the pandemic; and the impact on economic activity, including the possibility of recession or financial market instability. measures to contain a global pandemic may intensify other risks described in these risk factors. we may incur increased costs to effectively manage these aspects of our business. if we are unsuccessful, it may adversely impact our revenues, cash flows, market share growth, and reputation. the long-term effects of climate change on the global economy and the it industry in particular are unclear. environmental regulations or changes in the supply, demand, or available sources of energy or other resources may affect the availability or cost of goods and services, including natural resources, necessary to run our business. changes in climate where we operate may increase the costs of powering and cooling computer hardware we use to develop software and provide cloud-based services. 35part i item 1a \u00a0 our global business exposes us to operational and economic risks. our customers are located throughout the world and a significant part of our revenue comes from international sales. the global nature of our business creates operational, economic, and geopolitical risks. our results of operations may be affected by global, regional, and local economic developments, monetary policy, inflation, and recession, as well as political and military disputes. in addition, our international growth strategy includes certain markets, the developing nature of which presents several risks, including deterioration of social, political, labor, or economic conditions in a country or region, and difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations. emerging nationalist and protectionist trends and concerns about human rights, the environment, and political expression in specific countries may significantly alter the trade and commercial environments. changes to trade policy or agreements as a result of populism, protectionism, or economic nationalism may result in higher tariffs, local sourcing initiatives, and non-local sourcing restrictions, export controls, investment restrictions, or other developments that make it more difficult to sell our products in foreign countries. disruptions of these kinds in developed or emerging markets could negatively impact demand for our products and services,  impair our ability to operate in certain regions, or increase operating costs. although we hedge a portion of our international currency exposure, significant fluctuations in foreign exchange rates between the u.s. dollar and foreign currencies may adversely affect our results of operations.  our business depends on our ability to attract and retain talented employees. our business is based on successfully attracting and retaining talented employees representing diverse backgrounds, experiences, and skill sets. the market for highly skilled workers and leaders in our industry is extremely competitive. maintaining our brand and reputation, as well as a diverse and inclusive work environment that enables all our employees to thrive, are important to our ability to recruit and retain employees. we are also limited in our ability to recruit internationally by restrictive domestic immigration laws. changes to u.s. immigration policies that restrain the flow of technical and professional talent may inhibit our ability to adequately staff our research and development efforts. if we are less successful in our recruiting efforts, or if we cannot retain highly skilled workers and key leaders, our ability to develop and deliver successful products and services may be adversely affected. effective succession planning is also important to our long-term success. failure to ensure effective transfer of knowledge and smooth transitions involving key employees could hinder our strategic planning and execution. how employment-related laws are interpreted and applied to our workforce practices may result in increased operating costs and less flexibility in how we meet our workforce needs. our global workforce is predominantly non-unionized, although we do have some employees in the u.s. and internationally who are represented by unions or works councils. in the u.s., there has been a general increase in workers exercising their right to form or join a union. the unionization of significant employee populations could result in higher costs and other operational changes necessary to respond to changing conditions and to establish new relationships with worker representatives. 36part ii item 7 \u00a0 economic conditions, challenges, and risks the markets for software, devices, and cloud-based services are dynamic and highly competitive. our competitors are developing new software and devices, while also deploying competing cloud-based services for consumers and businesses. the devices and form factors customers prefer evolve rapidly, influencing how users access services in the cloud and, in some cases, the user\u2019s choice of which suite of cloud-based services to use. aggregate demand for our software, services, and devices is also correlated to global macroeconomic and geopolitical factors, which remain dynamic. we must continue to evolve and adapt over an extended time in pace with this changing environment.  the investments we are making in cloud and ai infrastructure and devices will continue to increase our operating costs and may decrease our operating margins. we continue to identify and evaluate opportunities to expand our datacenter locations and increase our server capacity to meet the evolving needs of our customers, particularly given the growing demand for ai services. our datacenters depend on the availability of permitted and buildable land, predictable energy, networking supplies, and servers, including graphics processing units (\u201cgpus\u201d) and other components. our devices are primarily manufactured by third-party contract manufacturers. for the majority of our products, we have the ability to use other manufacturers if a current vendor becomes unavailable or unable to meet our requirements. however, some of our products contain certain components for which there are very few qualified suppliers. extended disruptions at these suppliers could impact our ability to manufacture devices on time to meet consumer demand.  our success is highly dependent on our ability to attract and retain qualified employees. we hire a mix of university and industry talent worldwide. we compete for talented individuals globally by offering an exceptional working environment, broad customer reach, scale in resources, the ability to grow one\u2019s career across many different products and businesses, and competitive compensation and benefits. our international operations provide a significant portion of our total revenue and expenses. many of these revenue and expenses are denominated in currencies other than the u.s. dollar. as a result, changes in foreign exchange rates may significantly affect revenue and expenses. fluctuations in the u.s. dollar relative to certain foreign currencies reduced reported revenue and expenses from our international operations in fiscal year 2023. on january 18, 2023, we announced decisions we made to align our cost structure with our revenue and customer demand, prioritize our investments in strategic areas, and consolidate office space. as a result, we recorded a $1.2 billion charge in the second quarter of fiscal year 2023 (\u201cq2 charge\u201d), which included employee severance expenses of $800 million, impairment charges resulting from changes to our hardware portfolio, and costs related to lease consolidation activities. first, we reduced our overall workforce by approximately 10,000 jobs through the third quarter of fiscal year 2023 related to the q2 charge, which represents less than 5% of our total employee base. while we eliminated roles in some areas, we will continue to hire in key strategic areas. second, we are allocating both our capital and talent to areas of secular growth and long-term competitiveness, while divesting in other areas. third, we are consolidating our leases to create higher density across our workspaces, which impacted our financial results through the remainder of fiscal year 2023, and we may make similar decisions in future periods as we continue to evaluate our real estate needs. refer to risk factors (part i, item 1a of this form 10-k) for a discussion of these factors and other risks. seasonality our revenue fluctuates quarterly and is generally higher in the second and fourth quarters of our fiscal year. second quarter revenue is driven by corporate year-end spending trends in our major markets and holiday season spending by consumers, and fourth quarter revenue is driven by the volume of multi-year on-premises contracts executed during the period.  change in accounting estimate in july 2022, we completed an assessment of the useful lives of our server and network equipment. due to investments in software that increased efficiencies in how we operate our server and network equipment, as well as advances in technology, we determined we should increase the estimated useful lives of both server and network equipment from four years to six years. this change in accounting estimate was effective beginning fiscal year 2023. based on the carrying amount of server and network equipment included in property and equipment, net as of june 30, 2022, the effect of this change in estimate for fiscal year 2023 was an increase in operating income of $3.7 billion and net income of $3.0 billion, or $0.40 per both basic and diluted share. 41part ii item 7 \u00a0 reportable segments we report our financial performance based on the following segments: productivity and business processes, intelligent cloud, and more personal computing. the segment amounts included in md&a are presented on a basis consistent with our internal management reporting. we have recast certain prior period amounts to conform to the way we internally manage and monitor our business. additional information on our reportable segments is contained in note 19 \u2013 segment information and geographic data of the notes to financial statements (part ii, item 8 of this form 10-k).  metrics we use metrics in assessing the performance of our business and to make informed decisions regarding the allocation of resources. we disclose metrics to enable investors to evaluate progress against our ambitions, provide transparency into performance trends, and reflect the continued evolution of our products and services. our commercial and other business metrics are fundamentally connected based on how customers use our products and services. the metrics are disclosed in the md&a or the notes to financial statements (part ii, item 8 of this form 10-k). financial metrics are calculated based on financial results prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america (\u201cgaap\u201d), and growth comparisons relate to the corresponding period of last fiscal year. in the first quarter of fiscal year 2023, we made updates to the presentation and method of calculation for certain metrics, most notably expanding our surface metric into a broader devices metric to incorporate additional revenue streams, along with other minor changes to align with how we manage our businesses.  commercial our commercial business primarily consists of server products and cloud services, office commercial, windows commercial, the commercial portion of linkedin, enterprise services, and dynamics. our commercial metrics allow management and investors to assess the overall health of our commercial business and include leading indicators of future performance. \u00a0 \u00a0 42part ii item 7 \u00a0 productivity and business processes and intelligent cloud metrics related to our productivity and business processes and intelligent cloud segments assess the health of our core businesses within these segments. the metrics reflect our cloud and on-premises product strategies and trends. \u00a0 \u00a0 more personal computing metrics related to our more personal computing segment assess the performance of key lines of business within this segment. these metrics provide strategic product insights which allow us to assess the performance across our commercial and consumer businesses. as we have diversity of target audiences and sales motions within the windows business, we monitor metrics that are reflective of those varying motions. \u00a0 \u00a0 43part ii item 7 \u00a0 summary results of operations \u00a0 \u00a0 adjusted gross margin, operating income, net income, and diluted earnings per share (\u201ceps\u201d) are non-gaap financial measures. current year non-gaap financial measures exclude the impact of the q2 charge, which includes employee severance expenses, impairment charges resulting from changes to our hardware portfolio, and costs related to lease consolidation activities. prior year non-gaap financial measures exclude the net income tax benefit related to transfer of intangible properties in the first quarter of fiscal year 2022. refer to note 12 \u2013 income taxes of the notes to financial statements (part ii, item 8 of this form 10-k) for further discussion. refer to the non-gaap financial measures section below for a reconciliation of our financial results reported in accordance with gaap to non-gaap financial results. fiscal year 2023 compared with

(expense), net  the components of other income (expense), net were as follows:  \u00a0 \u00a0 we use derivative instruments to manage risks related to foreign currencies, equity prices, interest rates, and credit; enhance investment returns; and facilitate portfolio diversification. gains and losses from changes in fair values of derivatives that are not designated as hedging instruments are primarily recognized in other income (expense), net.  fiscal year 2023 compared with fiscal year 2022 interest and dividends income increased due to higher yields, offset in part by lower portfolio balances. interest expense decreased due to a decrease in outstanding long-term debt due to debt maturities. net recognized gains on investments decreased due to lower gains on equity securities and higher losses on fixed income securities. net losses on derivatives increased due to losses related to managing strategic investments.  income taxes  effective tax rate our effective tax rate for fiscal years 2023 and 2022 was 19% and 13%, respectively. the increase in our effective tax rate was primarily due to a $3.3 billion net income tax benefit in the first quarter of fiscal year 2022 related to the transfer of intangible properties and a decrease in tax benefits relating to stock-based compensation. in the first quarter of fiscal year 2022, we transferred certain intangible properties from our puerto rico subsidiary to the u.s. the transfer of intangible properties resulted in a $3.3 billion net income tax benefit in the first quarter of fiscal year 2022, as the value of future u.s. tax deductions exceeded the current tax liability from the u.s. global intangible low-taxed income tax. our effective tax rate was lower than the u.s. federal statutory rate, primarily due to earnings taxed at lower rates in foreign jurisdictions resulting from producing and distributing our products and services through our foreign regional operations center in ireland. the mix of income before income taxes between the u.s. and foreign countries impacted our effective tax rate as a result of the geographic distribution of, and customer demand for, our products and services. in fiscal year 2023, our u.s. income before income taxes was $52.9 billion and our foreign income before income taxes was $36.4 billion. in fiscal year 2022, our u.s. income before income taxes was $47.8 billion and our foreign income before income taxes was $35.9 billion. uncertain tax positions we settled a portion of the internal revenue service (\u201cirs\u201d) audit for tax years 2004 to 2006 in fiscal year 2011. in february 2012, the irs withdrew its 2011 revenue agents report related to unresolved issues for tax years 2004 to 2006 and reopened the audit phase of the examination. we also settled a portion of the irs audit for tax years 2007 to 2009 in fiscal year 2016, and a portion of the irs audit for tax years 2010 to 2013 in fiscal year 2018. in the second quarter of fiscal year 2021, we settled an additional portion of the irs audits for tax years 2004 to 2013 and made a payment of $1.7 billion, including tax and interest. we remain under audit for tax years 2004 to 2017.  48part ii item 7 \u00a0 as of june 30, 2023, the primary unresolved issues for the irs audits relate to transfer pricing, which could have a material impact in our consolidated financial statements when the matters are resolved. we believe our allowances for income tax contingencies are adequate. we have not received a proposed assessment for the unresolved key transfer pricing issues. we do not expect a final resolution of these issues in the next 12 months. based on the information currently available, we do not anticipate a significant increase or decrease to our tax contingencies for these issues within the next 12 months. we are subject to income tax in many jurisdictions outside the u.s. our operations in certain jurisdictions remain subject to examination for tax years 1996 to 2022, some of which are currently under audit by local tax authorities. the resolution of each of these audits is not expected to be material to our consolidated financial statements. non-gaap financial measures adjusted gross margin, operating income, net income, and diluted eps are non-gaap financial measures. current year non-gaap financial measures exclude the impact of the q2 charge, which includes employee severance expenses, impairment charges resulting from changes to our hardware portfolio, and costs related to lease consolidation activities. prior year non-gaap financial measures  exclude the net income tax benefit related to transfer of intangible properties in the first quarter of fiscal year 2022. we believe these non-gaap measures aid investors by providing additional insight into our operational performance and help clarify trends affecting our business. for comparability of reporting, management considers non-gaap measures in conjunction with gaap financial results in evaluating business performance. these non-gaap financial measures presented should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, the measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with gaap. the following table reconciles our financial results reported in accordance with gaap to non-gaap financial results: \u00a0 \u00a0 *\tnot meaningful. 49part ii item 7 \u00a0 liquidity and capital resources we expect existing cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, cash flows from operations, and access to capital markets to continue to be sufficient to fund our operating activities and cash commitments for investing and financing activities, such as dividends, share repurchases, debt maturities, material capital expenditures, and the transition tax related to the tax cuts and jobs act (\u201ctcja\u201d), for at least the next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future.  cash, cash equivalents, and investments  cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments totaled $111.3 billion and $104.8 billion as of june 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. equity investments were $9.9 billion and $6.9 billion as of june 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. our short-term investments are primarily intended to facilitate liquidity and capital preservation. they consist predominantly of highly liquid investment-grade fixed-income securities, diversified among industries and individual issuers. the investments are predominantly u.s. dollar-denominated securities, but also include foreign currency-denominated securities to diversify risk. our fixed-income investments are exposed to interest rate risk and credit risk. the credit risk and average maturity of our fixed-income portfolio are managed to achieve economic returns that correlate to certain fixed-income indices. the settlement risk related to these investments is insignificant given that the short-term investments held are primarily highly liquid investment-grade fixed-income securities.  valuation  in general, and where applicable, we use quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities to determine the fair value of our financial instruments. this pricing methodology applies to our level 1 investments, such as u.s. government securities, common and preferred stock, and mutual funds. if quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities are not available to determine fair value, then we use quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities or inputs other than the quoted prices that are observable either directly or indirectly. this pricing methodology applies to our level 2 investments, such as commercial paper, certificates of deposit, u.s. agency securities, foreign government bonds, mortgage- and asset-backed securities, corporate notes and bonds, and municipal securities. level 3 investments are valued using internally-developed models with unobservable inputs. assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis using unobservable inputs are an immaterial portion of our portfolio.  a majority of our investments are priced by pricing vendors and are generally level 1 or level 2 investments as these vendors either provide a quoted market price in an active market or use observable inputs for their pricing without applying significant adjustments. broker pricing is used mainly when a quoted price is not available, the investment is not priced by our pricing vendors, or when a broker price is more reflective of fair values in the market in which the investment trades. our broker-priced investments are generally classified as level 2 investments because the broker prices these investments based on similar assets without applying significant adjustments. in addition, all our broker-priced investments have a sufficient level of trading volume to demonstrate that the fair values used are appropriate for these investments. our fair value processes include controls that are designed to ensure appropriate fair values are recorded. these controls include model validation, review of key model inputs, analysis of period-over-period fluctuations, and independent recalculation of prices where appropriate.  cash flows  cash from operations decreased $1.5 billion to $87.6 billion for fiscal year 2023, mainly due to an increase in cash paid to employees and suppliers and cash used to pay income taxes, offset in part by an increase in cash received from customers. cash used in financing decreased $14.9 billion to $43.9 billion for fiscal year 2023, mainly due to a $10.5 billion decrease in common stock repurchases and a $6.3 billion decrease in repayments of debt, offset in part by a $1.7 billion increase in dividends paid. cash used in investing decreased $7.6 billion to $22.7 billion for fiscal year 2023, due to a $20.4 billion decrease in cash used for acquisitions of companies, net of cash acquired, and purchases of intangible and other assets, offset in part by a $8.2 billion decrease in cash from net investment purchases, sales, and maturities, and a $4.2 billion increase in additions to property and equipment. 50part ii item 7 \u00a0 debt proceeds we issue debt to take advantage of favorable pricing and liquidity in the debt markets, reflecting our credit rating and the low interest rate environment. the proceeds of these issuances were or will be used for general corporate purposes, which may include, among other things, funding for working capital, capital expenditures, repurchases of capital stock, acquisitions, and repayment of existing debt. refer to note 11 \u2013 debt of the notes to financial statements (part ii, item 8 of this form 10-k) for further discussion. unearned revenue  unearned revenue comprises mainly unearned revenue related to volume licensing programs, which may include software assurance (\u201csa\u201d) and cloud services. unearned revenue is generally invoiced annually at the beginning of each contract period for multi-year agreements and recognized ratably over the coverage period. unearned revenue also includes payments for other offerings for which we have been paid in advance and earn the revenue when we transfer control of the product or service. refer to note 1 \u2013 accounting policies of the notes to financial statements (part ii, item 8 of this form 10-k) for further discussion. the following table outlines the expected future recognition of unearned revenue as of june 30, 2023: \u00a0 \u00a0 if our customers choose to license cloud-based versions of our products and services rather than licensing transaction-based products and services, the associated revenue will shift from being recognized at the time of the transaction to being recognized over the subscription period or upon consumption, as applicable. refer to note 13 \u2013 unearned revenue of the notes to financial statements (part ii, item 8 of this form 10-k) for further discussion.  material cash requirements and other obligations contractual obligations the following table summarizes the payments due by fiscal year for our outstanding contractual obligations as of june 30, 2023:   \u00a0 (a)refer to note 11 \u2013 debt of the notes to financial statements (part ii, item 8 of this form 10-k). (b)refer to note 7 \u2013 property and equipment of the notes to financial statements (part ii, item 8 of this form 10-k). (c)refer to note 14 \u2013 leases of the notes to financial statements (part ii, item 8 of this form 10-k). (d)purchase commitments primarily relate to datacenters and include open purchase orders and take-or-pay contracts that are not presented as construction commitments above. 51part ii item 7 \u00a0 income taxes as a result of the tcja, we are required to pay a one-time transition tax on deferred foreign income not previously subject to u.s. income tax. under the tcja, the transition tax is payable in interest-free installments over eight years, with 8% due in each of the first five years, 15% in year six, 20% in year seven, and 25% in year eight. we have paid transition tax of $7.7 billion, which included $1.5 billion for fiscal year 2023. the remaining transition tax of $10.5 billion is payable over the next three years, with $2.7 billion payable within 12 months.  in fiscal year 2023, we paid cash tax of $4.8 billion due to the mandatory capitalization for tax purposes of research and development expenditures enacted by the tcja and effective on july 1, 2022.  share repurchases  during fiscal years 2023 and 2022, we repurchased 69 million shares and 95 million shares of our common stock for $18.4 billion and $28.0 billion, respectively, through our share repurchase programs. all repurchases were made using cash resources. as of june 30, 2023, $22.3 billion remained of our $60 billion share repurchase program. refer to note 16 \u2013 stockholders\u2019 equity of the notes to financial statements (part ii, item 8 of this form 10-k) for further discussion. dividends  during fiscal year 2023 and 2022, our board of directors declared quarterly dividends of $0.68 per share and $0.62 per share, totaling $20.2 billion and $18.6 billion, respectively. we intend to continue returning capital to shareholders in the form of dividends, subject to declaration by our board of directors. refer to note 16 \u2013 stockholders\u2019 equity of the notes to financial statements (part ii, item 8 of this form 10-k) for further discussion. other planned uses of capital  on january 18, 2022, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire activision blizzard, inc. (\u201cactivision blizzard\u201d) for $95.00 per share in an all-cash transaction valued at $68.7 billion, inclusive of activision blizzard\u2019s net cash. the acquisition has been approved by activision blizzard\u2019s shareholders. we continue to work toward closing the transaction subject to obtaining required regulatory approvals and  satisfaction of other customary closing conditions. microsoft and activision blizzard have jointly agreed to extend the merger agreement through october 18, 2023 to allow for additional time to resolve remaining regulatory concerns. we will continue to invest in sales, marketing, product support infrastructure, and existing and advanced areas of technology, as well as acquisitions that align with our business strategy. additions to property and equipment will continue, including new facilities, datacenters, and computer systems for research and development, sales and marketing, support, and administrative staff. we expect capital expenditures to increase in coming years to support growth in our cloud offerings and our investments in ai infrastructure. we have operating and finance leases for datacenters, corporate offices, research and development facilities, microsoft experience centers, and certain equipment. we have not engaged in any related party transactions or arrangements with unconsolidated entities or other persons that are reasonably likely to materially affect liquidity or the availability of capital resources.  critical accounting estimates  our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with gaap. preparing consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. critical accounting estimates are those estimates that involve a significant level of estimation uncertainty and could have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. we have critical accounting estimates in the areas of revenue recognition, impairment of investment securities, goodwill, research and development costs, legal and other contingencies, income taxes, and inventories.  52part ii item 7 \u00a0 revenue recognition  our contracts with customers often include promises to transfer multiple products and services to a customer. determining whether products and services are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately versus together may require significant judgment. when a cloud-based service includes both on-premises software licenses and cloud services, judgment is required to determine whether the software license is considered distinct and accounted for separately, or not distinct and accounted for together with the cloud service and recognized over time. certain cloud services, primarily office 365, depend on a significant level of integration, interdependency, and interrelation between the desktop applications and cloud services, and are accounted for together as one performance obligation. revenue from office 365 is recognized ratably over the period in which the cloud services are provided.  judgment is required to determine the stand-alone selling price (\u201cssp\") for each distinct performance obligation. we use a single amount to estimate ssp for items that are not sold separately, including on-premises licenses sold with sa or software updates provided at no additional charge. we use a range of amounts to estimate ssp when we sell each of the products and services separately and need to determine whether there is a discount to be allocated based on the relative ssp of the various products and services.  in instances where ssp is not directly observable, such as when we do not sell the product or service separately, we determine the ssp using information that may include market conditions and other observable inputs. we typically have more than one ssp for individual products and services due to the stratification of those products and services by customers and circumstances. in these instances, we may use information such as the size of the customer and geographic region in determining the ssp.  due to the various benefits from and the nature of our sa program, judgment is required to assess the pattern of delivery, including the exercise pattern of certain benefits across our portfolio of customers.  our products are generally sold with a right of return, we may provide other credits or incentives, and in certain instances we estimate customer usage of our products and services, which are accounted for as variable consideration when determining the amount of revenue to recognize. returns and credits are estimated at contract inception and updated at the end of each reporting period if additional information becomes available. changes to our estimated variable consideration were not material for the periods presented.  impairment of investment securities  we review debt investments quarterly for credit losses and impairment. if the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value, we evaluate, among other factors, general market conditions, credit quality of debt instrument issuers, and the extent to which the fair value is less than cost. this determination requires significant judgment. in making this judgment, we employ a systematic methodology that considers available quantitative and qualitative evidence in evaluating potential impairment of our investments. in addition, we consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of, and business outlook for, the investee. if we have plans to sell the security or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery, then a decline in fair value below cost is recorded as an impairment charge in other income (expense), net and a new cost basis in the investment is established. if market, industry, and/or investee conditions deteriorate, we may incur future impairments.  equity investments without readily determinable fair values are written down to fair value if a qualitative assessment indicates that the investment is impaired and the fair value of the investment is less than carrying value. we perform a qualitative assessment on a periodic basis. we are required to estimate the fair value of the investment to determine the amount of the impairment loss. once an investment is determined to be impaired, an impairment charge is recorded in other income (expense), net.  53part ii item 7 \u00a0 goodwill  we allocate goodwill to reporting units based on the reporting unit expected to benefit from the business combination. we evaluate our reporting units on an annual basis and, if necessary, reassign goodwill using a relative fair value allocation approach. goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level (operating segment or one level below an operating segment) on an annual basis (may 1) and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. these events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate, legal factors, operating performance indicators, competition, or sale or disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit.  application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment, including the identification of reporting units, assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units, assignment of goodwill to reporting units, and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit. the fair value of each reporting unit is estimated primarily through the use of a discounted cash flow methodology. this analysis requires significant judgments, including estimation of future cash flows, which is dependent on internal forecasts, estimation of the long-term rate of growth for our business, estimation of the useful life over which cash flows will occur, and determination of our weighted average cost of capital.  the estimates used to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit change from year to year based on operating results, market conditions, and other factors. changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and goodwill impairment for each reporting unit.  research and development costs  costs incurred internally in researching and developing a computer software product are charged to expense until technological feasibility has been established for the product. once technological feasibility is established, software costs are capitalized until the product is available for general release to customers. judgment is required in determining when technological feasibility of a product is established. we have determined that technological feasibility for our software products is reached after all high-risk development issues have been resolved through coding and testing. generally, this occurs shortly before the products are released to production. the amortization of these costs is included in cost of revenue over the estimated life of the products.  legal and other contingencies  the outcomes of legal proceedings and claims brought against us are subject to significant uncertainty. an estimated loss from a loss contingency such as a legal proceeding or claim is accrued by a charge to income if it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. in determining whether a loss should be accrued we evaluate, among other factors, the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss. changes in these factors could materially impact our consolidated financial statements. 54part ii item 7 \u00a0 income taxes  the objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year, and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entity\u2019s financial statements or tax returns. we recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. accounting literature also provides guidance on derecognition of income tax assets and liabilities, classification of deferred income tax assets and liabilities, accounting for interest and penalties associated with tax positions, and income tax disclosures. judgment is required in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements or tax returns. variations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could materially impact our consolidated financial statements.  inventories  inventories are stated at average cost, subject to the lower of cost or net realizable value. cost includes materials, labor, and manufacturing overhead related to the purchase and production of inventories. net realizable value is the estimated selling price less estimated costs of completion, disposal, and transportation. we regularly review inventory quantities on hand, future purchase commitments with our suppliers, and the estimated utility of our inventory. these reviews include analysis of demand forecasts, product life cycle status, product development plans, current sales levels, pricing strategy, and component cost trends. if our review indicates a reduction in utility below carrying value, we reduce our inventory to a new cost basis through a charge to cost of revenue. 55part ii item 7 \u00a0 statement of management\u2019s responsibility for financial statements  management is responsible for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements and related information that are presented in this report. the consolidated financial statements, which include amounts based on management\u2019s estimates and judgments, have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america.  the company designs and maintains accounting and internal control systems to provide reasonable assurance at reasonable cost that assets are safeguarded against loss from unauthorized use or disposition, and that the financial records are reliable for preparing consolidated financial statements and maintaining accountability for assets. these systems are augmented by written policies, an organizational structure providing division of responsibilities, careful selection and training of qualified personnel, and a program of internal audits.  the company engaged deloitte & touche llp, an independent registered public accounting firm, to audit and render an opinion on the consolidated financial statements and internal control over financial reporting in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board (united states).  the board of directors, through its audit committee, consisting solely of independent directors of the company, meets periodically with management, internal auditors, and our independent registered public accounting firm to ensure that each is meeting its responsibilities and to discuss matters concerning internal controls and financial reporting. deloitte & touche llp and the internal auditors each have full and free access to the audit committee.  \u00a0 \u00a0 56part ii item 7a \u00a0 item 7a. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk risks  we are exposed to economic risk from foreign exchange rates, interest rates, credit risk, and equity prices. we use derivatives instruments to manage these risks, however, they may still impact our consolidated financial statements.  foreign currencies  certain forecasted transactions, assets, and liabilities are exposed to foreign currency risk. we monitor our foreign currency exposures daily to maximize the economic effectiveness of our foreign currency positions, including hedges. principal currency exposures include the euro, japanese yen, british pound, canadian dollar, and australian dollar.  interest rate  securities held in our fixed-income portfolio are subject to different interest rate risks based on their maturities. we manage the average maturity of the fixed-income portfolio to achieve economic returns that correlate to certain global fixed-income indices.  credit our fixed-income portfolio is diversified and consists primarily of investment-grade securities. we manage credit exposures relative to broad-based indices to facilitate portfolio diversification.  equity  securities held in our equity investments portfolio are subject to price risk.  sensitivity analysis the following table sets forth the potential loss in future earnings or fair values, including associated derivatives, resulting from hypothetical changes in relevant market rates or prices:  \u00a0 \u00a0 57part ii item 8 \u00a0 notes to financial statements  note 1 \u2014 accounting policiesaccounting principles our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america (\u201cgaap\u201d).we have recast certain prior period amounts to conform to the current period presentation. the recast of these prior period amounts had no impact on our consolidated balance sheets, consolidated income statements, or consolidated cash flows statements. principles of consolidation the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of microsoft corporation and its subsidiaries. intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated. estimates and assumptions preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. examples of estimates and assumptions include: for revenue recognition, determining the nature and timing of satisfaction of performance obligations, and determining the standalone selling price (\u201cssp\u201d) of performance obligations, variable consideration, and other obligations such as product returns and refunds; loss contingencies; product warranties; the fair value of and/or potential impairment of goodwill and intangible assets for our reporting units; product life cycles; useful lives of our tangible and intangible assets; allowances for doubtful accounts; the market value of, and demand for, our inventory; stock-based compensation forfeiture rates; when technological feasibility is achieved for our products; the potential outcome of uncertain tax positions that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements or tax returns; and determining the timing and amount of impairments for investments. actual results and outcomes may differ from management\u2019s estimates and assumptions due to risks and uncertainties.in july 2022, we completed an assessment of the useful lives of our server and network equipment. due to investments in software that increased efficiencies in how we operate our server and network equipment, as well as advances in technology, we determined we should increase the estimated useful lives of both server and network equipment from four years to six years. this change in accounting estimate was effective beginning fiscal year 2023. based on the carrying amount of server and network equipment included in property and equipment, net as of june 30, 2022, the effect of this change in estimate for fiscal year 2023 was an increase in operating income of $3.7 billion and net income of $3.0 billion, or $0.40 per both basic and diluted share.foreign currencies assets and liabilities recorded in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rate on the balance sheet date. revenue and expenses are translated at average rates of exchange prevailing during the year. translation adjustments resulting from this process are recorded to other comprehensive income. revenueproduct revenue and service and other revenue product revenue includes sales from operating systems, cross-device productivity and collaboration applications, server applications, business solution applications, desktop and server management tools, software development tools, video games, and hardware such as pcs, tablets, gaming and entertainment consoles, other intelligent devices, and related accessories. service and other revenue includes sales from cloud-based solutions that provide customers with software, services, platforms, and content such as office 365, azure, dynamics 365, and xbox; solution support; and consulting services. service and other revenue also includes sales from online advertising and linkedin.63 part iiitem 8\u00a0revenue recognitionrevenue is recognized upon transfer of control of promised products or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those products or services. we enter into contracts that can include various combinations of products and services, which are generally capable of being distinct and accounted for as separate performance obligations. revenue is recognized net of allowances for returns and any taxes collected from customers, which are subsequently remitted to governmental authorities. nature of products and serviceslicenses for on-premises software provide the customer with a right to use the software as it exists when made available to the customer. customers may purchase perpetual licenses or subscribe to licenses, which provide customers with the same functionality and differ mainly in the duration over which the customer benefits from the software. revenue from distinct on-premises licenses is recognized upfront at the point in time when the software is made available to the customer. in cases where we allocate revenue to software updates, primarily because the updates are provided at no additional charge, revenue is recognized as the updates are provided, which is generally ratably over the estimated life of the related device or license.certain volume licensing programs, including enterprise agreements, include on-premises licenses combined with software assurance (\u201csa\u201d). sa conveys rights to new software and upgrades released over the contract period and provides support, tools, and training to help customers deploy and use products more efficiently. on-premises licenses are considered distinct performance obligations when sold with sa. revenue allocated to sa is generally recognized ratably over the contract period as customers simultaneously consume and receive benefits, given that sa comprises distinct performance obligations that are satisfied over time. cloud services, which allow customers to use hosted software over the contract period without taking possession of the software, are provided on either a subscription or consumption basis. revenue related to cloud services provided on a subscription basis is recognized ratably over the contract period. revenue related to cloud services provided on a consumption basis, such as the amount of storage used in a period, is recognized based on the customer utilization of such resources. when cloud services require a significant level of integration and interdependency with software and the individual components are not considered distinct, all revenue is recognized over the period in which the cloud services are provided. revenue from search advertising is recognized when the advertisement appears in the search results or when the action necessary to earn the revenue has been completed. revenue from consulting services is recognized as services are provided. our hardware is generally highly dependent on, and interrelated with, the underlying operating system and cannot function without the operating system. in these cases, the hardware and software license are accounted for as a single performance obligation and revenue is recognized at the point in time when ownership is transferred to resellers or directly to end customers through retail stores and online marketplaces. refer to note 19 \u2013 segment information and geographic data for further information, including revenue by significant product and service offering.significant judgmentsour contracts with customers often include promises to transfer multiple products and services to a customer. determining whether products and services are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately versus together may require significant judgment. when a cloud-based service includes both on-premises software licenses and cloud services, judgment is required to determine whether the software license is considered distinct and accounted for separately, or not distinct and accounted for together with the cloud service and recognized over time. certain cloud services, primarily office 365, depend on a significant level of integration, interdependency, and interrelation between the desktop applications and cloud services, and are accounted for together as one performance obligation. revenue from office 365 is recognized ratably over the period in which the cloud services are provided.64 part iiitem 8\u00a0judgment is required to determine the ssp for each distinct performance obligation. we use a single amount to estimate ssp for items that are not sold separately, including on-premises licenses sold with sa or software updates provided at no additional charge. we use a range of amounts to estimate ssp when we sell each of the products and services separately and need to determine whether there is a discount to be allocated based on the relative ssp of the various products and services. in instances where ssp is not directly observable, such as when we do not sell the product or service separately, we determine the ssp using information that may include market conditions and other observable inputs. we typically have more than one ssp for individual products and services due to the stratification of those products and services by customers and circumstances. in these instances, we may use information such as the size of the customer and geographic region in determining the ssp. due to the various benefits from and the nature of our sa program, judgment is required to assess the pattern of delivery, including the exercise pattern of certain benefits across our portfolio of customers. our products are generally sold with a right of return, we may provide other credits or incentives, and in certain instances we estimate customer usage of our products and services, which are accounted for as variable consideration when determining the amount of revenue to recognize. returns and credits are estimated at contract inception and updated at the end of each reporting period if additional information becomes available. changes to our estimated variable consideration were not material for the periods presented.contract balances and other receivables timing of revenue recognition may differ from the timing of invoicing to customers. we record a receivable when revenue is recognized prior to invoicing, or unearned revenue when revenue is recognized subsequent to invoicing. for multi-year agreements, we generally invoice customers annually at the beginning of each annual coverage period. we record a receivable related to revenue recognized for multi-year on-premises licenses as we have an unconditional right to invoice and receive payment in the future related to those licenses. unearned revenue comprises mainly unearned revenue related to volume licensing programs, which may include sa and cloud services. unearned revenue is generally invoiced annually at the beginning of each contract period for multi-year agreements and recognized ratably over the coverage period. unearned revenue also includes payments for consulting services to be performed in the future, linkedin subscriptions, office 365 subscriptions, xbox subscriptions, windows post-delivery support, dynamics business solutions, and other offerings for which we have been paid in advance and earn the revenue when we transfer control of the product or service. refer to note 13 \u2013 unearned revenue for further information, including unearned revenue by segment and changes in unearned revenue during the period.payment terms and conditions vary by contract type, although terms generally include a requirement of payment within 30 to 60 days. in instances where the timing of revenue recognition differs from the timing of invoicing, we have determined our contracts generally do not include a significant financing component. the primary purpose of our invoicing terms is to provide customers with simplified and predictable ways of purchasing our products and services, not to receive financing from our customers or to provide customers with financing. examples include invoicing at the beginning of a subscription term with revenue recognized ratably over the contract period, and multi-year on-premises licenses that are invoiced annually with revenue recognized upfront.as of june 30, 2023 and 2022, long-term accounts receivable, net of allowance for doubtful accounts, was $4.5 billion and $3.8 billion, respectively, and is included in other long-term assets in our consolidated balance sheets.the allowance for doubtful accounts reflects our best estimate of probable losses inherent in the accounts receivable balance. we determine the allowance based on known troubled accounts, historical experience, and other currently available evidence. 65 part iiitem 8\u00a0activity in the allowance for doubtful accounts was as follows: \u00a0 \u00a0allowance for doubtful accounts included in our consolidated balance sheets:\u00a0 \u00a0as of june 30, 2023 and 2022, other receivables related to activities to facilitate the purchase of server components were $9.2 billion and $6.1 billion, respectively, and are included in other current assets in our consolidated balance sheets. we record financing receivables when we offer certain of our customers the option to acquire our software products and services offerings through a financing program in a limited number of countries. as of june 30, 2023 and 2022, our financing receivables, net were $5.3 billion and $4.1 billion, respectively, for short-term and long-term financing receivables, which are included in other current assets and other long-term assets in our consolidated balance sheets. we record an allowance to cover expected losses based on troubled accounts, historical experience, and other currently available evidence.assets recognized from costs to obtain a contract with a customerwe recognize an asset for the incremental costs of obtaining a contract with a customer if we expect the benefit of those costs to be longer than one year. we have determined that certain sales incentive programs meet the requirements to be capitalized. total capitalized costs to obtain a contract were immaterial during the periods presented and are included in other current and long-term assets in our consolidated balance sheets. we apply a practical expedient to expense costs as incurred for costs to obtain a contract with a customer when the amortization period would have been one year or less. these costs include our internal sales organization compensation program and certain partner sales incentive programs as we have determined annual compensation is commensurate with annual sales activities.cost of revenue cost of revenue includes: manufacturing and distribution costs for products sold and programs licensed; operating costs related to product support service centers and product distribution centers; costs incurred to include software on pcs sold by original equipment manufacturers (\u201coem\u201d), to drive traffic to our websites, and to acquire online advertising space; costs incurred to support and maintain cloud-based and other online products and services, including datacenter costs and royalties; warranty costs; inventory valuation adjustments; costs associated with the delivery of consulting services; and the amortization of capitalized software development costs. capitalized software development costs are amortized over the estimated lives of the products. 66 part iiitem 8\u00a0product warranty we provide for the estimated costs of fulfilling our obligations under hardware and software warranties at the time the related revenue is recognized. for hardware warranties, we estimate the costs based on historical and projected product failure rates, historical and projected repair costs, and knowledge of specific product failures (if any). the specific hardware warranty terms and conditions vary depending upon the product sold and the country in which we do business, but generally include parts and labor over a period generally ranging from 90 days to three years. for software warranties, we estimate the costs to provide bug fixes, such as security patches, over the estimated life of the software. we regularly reevaluate our estimates to assess the adequacy of the recorded warranty liabilities and adjust the amounts as necessary. research and development research and development expenses include payroll, employee benefits, stock-based compensation expense, and other headcount-related expenses associated with product development. research and development expenses also include third-party development and programming costs and the amortization of purchased software code and services content. such costs related to software development are included in research and development expense until the point that technological feasibility is reached, which for our software products, is generally shortly before the products are released to production. once technological feasibility is reached, such costs are capitalized and amortized to cost of revenue over the estimated lives of the products. sales and marketing sales and marketing expenses include payroll, employee benefits, stock-based compensation expense, and other headcount-related expenses associated with sales and marketing personnel, and the costs of advertising, promotions, trade shows, seminars, and other programs. advertising costs are expensed as incurred. advertising expense was $904 million, $1.5 billion, and $1.5 billion in fiscal years 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively. stock-based compensation compensation cost for stock awards, which include restricted stock units (\u201crsus\u201d) and performance stock units (\u201cpsus\u201d), is measured at the fair value on the grant date and recognized as expense, net of estimated forfeitures, over the related service or performance period. the fair value of stock awards is based on the quoted price of our common stock on the grant date less the present value of expected dividends not received during the vesting period. we measure the fair value of psus using a monte carlo valuation model. compensation cost for rsus is recognized using the straight-line method and for psus is recognized using the accelerated method.compensation expense for the employee stock purchase plan (\u201cespp\u201d) is measured as the discount the employee is entitled to upon purchase and is recognized in the period of purchase.employee severanceon january 18, 2023, we announced a decision to reduce our overall workforce by approximately 10,000 jobs through the third quarter of fiscal year 2023. during the three months ended december 31, 2022, we recorded $800 million of employee severance expenses related to these job eliminations as part of an ongoing employee benefit plan. these employee severance expenses were incurred as part of a corporate program, and were included in general and administrative expenses in our consolidated income statements and allocated to our segments based on relative gross margin. refer to note 19 \u2013 segment information and geographic data for further information.income taxes income tax expense includes u.s. and international income taxes, and interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions. certain income and expenses are not reported in tax returns and financial statements in the same year. the tax effect of such temporary differences is reported as deferred income taxes. deferred tax assets are reported net of a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized. all deferred income taxes are classified as long-term in our consolidated balance sheets. 67 part iiitem 8\u00a0financial instrumentsinvestmentswe consider all highly liquid interest-earning investments with a maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase to be cash equivalents. the fair values of these investments approximate their carrying values. in general, investments with original maturities of greater than three months and remaining maturities of less than one year are classified as short-term investments. investments with maturities beyond one year may be classified as short-term based on their highly liquid nature and because such marketable securities represent the investment of cash that is available for current operations. debt investments are classified as available-for-sale and realized gains and losses are recorded using the specific identification method. changes in fair value, excluding credit losses and impairments, are recorded in other comprehensive income. fair value is calculated based on publicly available market information or other estimates determined by management. if the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value, we evaluate, among other factors, general market conditions, credit quality of debt instrument issuers, and the extent to which the fair value is less than cost. to determine credit losses, we employ a systematic methodology that considers available quantitative and qualitative evidence. in addition, we consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of, and business outlook for, the investee. if we have plans to sell the security or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery, then a decline in fair value below cost is recorded as an impairment charge in other income (expense), net and a new cost basis in the investment is established. if market, industry, and/or investee conditions deteriorate, we may incur future impairments.equity investments with readily determinable fair values are measured at fair value. equity investments without readily determinable fair values are measured using the equity method or measured at cost with adjustments for observable changes in price or impairments (referred to as the measurement alternative). we perform a qualitative assessment on a periodic basis and recognize an impairment if there are sufficient indicators that the fair value of the investment is less than carrying value. changes in value are recorded in other income (expense), net. derivativesderivative instruments are recognized as either assets or liabilities and measured at fair value. the accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation. for derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges, gains and losses are recognized in other income (expense), net with offsetting gains and losses on the hedged items. gains and losses representing hedge components excluded from the assessment of effectiveness are recognized in other income (expense), net.for derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges, gains and losses are initially reported as a component of other comprehensive income and subsequently recognized in other income (expense), net with the corresponding hedged item. gains and losses representing hedge components excluded from the assessment of effectiveness are recognized in other income (expense), net. for derivative instruments that are not designated as hedges, gains and losses from changes in fair values are primarily recognized in other income (expense), net.68 part iiitem 8\u00a0fair value measurementswe account for certain assets and liabilities at fair value. the hierarchy below lists three levels of fair value based on the extent to which inputs used in measuring fair value are observable in the market. we categorize each of our fair value measurements in one of these three levels based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. these levels are: \u2022level 1 \u2013 inputs are based upon unadjusted quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets. our level 1 investments include u.s. government securities, common and preferred stock, and mutual funds. our level 1 derivative assets and liabilities include those actively traded on exchanges. \u2022level 2 \u2013 inputs are based upon quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active, and model-based valuation techniques (e.g. the black-scholes model) for which all significant inputs are observable in the market or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. where applicable, these models project future cash flows and discount the future amounts to a present value using market-based observable inputs including interest rate curves, credit spreads, foreign exchange rates, and forward and spot prices for currencies. our level 2 investments include commercial paper, certificates of deposit, u.s. agency securities, foreign government bonds, mortgage- and asset-backed securities, corporate notes and bonds, and municipal securities. our level 2 derivative assets and liabilities include certain cleared swap contracts and over-the-counter forward, option, and swap contracts.\u2022level 3 \u2013 inputs are generally unobservable and typically reflect management\u2019s estimates of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. the fair values are therefore determined using model-based techniques, including option pricing models and discounted cash flow models. our level 3 assets and liabilities include investments in corporate notes and bonds, municipal securities, and goodwill and intangible assets, when they are recorded at fair value due to an impairment charge. unobservable inputs used in the models are significant to the fair values of the assets and liabilities. we measure equity investments without readily determinable fair values on a nonrecurring basis. the fair values of these investments are determined based on valuation techniques using the best information available, and may include quoted market prices, market comparables, and discounted cash flow projections. our other current financial assets and current financial liabilities have fair values that approximate their carrying values.inventories inventories are stated at average cost, subject to the lower of cost or net realizable value. cost includes materials, labor, and manufacturing overhead related to the purchase and production of inventories. net realizable value is the estimated selling price less estimated costs of completion, disposal, and transportation. we regularly review inventory quantities on hand, future purchase commitments with our suppliers, and the estimated utility of our inventory. if our review indicates a reduction in utility below carrying value, we reduce our inventory to a new cost basis through a charge to cost of revenue. property and equipment property and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation, and depreciated using the straight-line method over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the asset or the lease term. the estimated useful lives of our property and equipment are generally as follows: computer software developed or acquired for internal use, three  years; computer equipment, two to six years; buildings and improvements, five to 15 years; leasehold improvements, three to 20 years; and furniture and equipment, one to 10 years. land is not depreciated. leaseswe determine if an arrangement is a lease at inception. operating leases are included in operating lease right-of-use (\u201crou\u201d) assets, other current liabilities, and operating lease liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets. finance leases are included in property and equipment, other current liabilities, and other long-term liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets. 69 part iiitem 8\u00a0rou assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. operating lease rou assets and liabilities are recognized at commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. as most of our leases do not provide an implicit rate, we generally use our incremental borrowing rate based on the estimated rate of interest for collateralized borrowing over a similar term of the lease payments at commencement date. the operating lease rou asset also includes any lease payments made and excludes lease incentives. our lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. lease expense for lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. we have lease agreements with lease and non-lease components, which are generally accounted for separately. for certain equipment leases, such as vehicles, we account for the lease and non-lease components as a single lease component. additionally, for certain equipment leases, we apply a portfolio approach to effectively account for the operating lease rou assets and liabilities. goodwill goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level (operating segment or one level below an operating segment) on an annual basis (may 1) and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. intangible assets our intangible assets are subject to amortization and are amortized using the straight-line method over their estimated period of benefit, ranging from one to 20 years. we evaluate the recoverability of intangible assets periodically by taking into account events or circumstances that may warrant revised estimates of useful lives or that indicate the asset may be impaired.  note 2 \u2014 earnings per sharebasic earnings per share (\u201ceps\u201d) is computed based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. diluted eps is computed based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock plus the effect of dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period using the treasury stock method. dilutive potential common shares include outstanding stock options and stock awards. the components of basic and diluted eps were as follows: \u00a0 \u00a0anti-dilutive stock-based awards excluded from the calculations of diluted eps were immaterial during the periods presented. 70part ii item 8 \u00a0 note 3 \u2014 other income (expense), net the components of other income (expense), net were as follows: \u00a0 \u00a0net recognized gains (losses) on investments net recognized gains (losses) on debt investments were as follows: \u00a0 \u00a0net recognized gains (losses) on equity investments were as follows:\u00a0  \u00a0 71part ii item 8 \u00a0 note 4 \u2014 investmentsinvestment components the components of investments were as follows:

\u201cother\u201d in the tables above include investments without readily determinable fair values measured using the equity method or measured at cost with adjustments for observable changes in price or impairments, and investments measured at fair value using net asset value as a practical expedient which are not categorized in the fair value hierarchy. as of june 30, 2023 and 2022, equity investments without readily determinable fair values measured at cost with adjustments for observable changes in price or impairments were $4.2 billion and $3.8 billion, respectively. 73 part iiitem 8\u00a0unrealized losses on debt investments debt investments with continuous unrealized losses for less than 12 months and 12 months or greater and their related fair values were as follows: \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0unrealized losses from fixed-income securities are primarily attributable to changes in interest rates. management does not believe any remaining unrealized losses represent impairments based on our evaluation of available evidence. debt investment maturities \u00a0  \u00a0 74part ii item 8 \u00a0 note 5 \u2014 derivatives we use derivative instruments to manage risks related to foreign currencies, interest rates, equity prices, and credit; to enhance investment returns; and to facilitate portfolio diversification. our objectives for holding derivatives include reducing, eliminating, and efficiently managing the economic impact of these exposures as effectively as possible. our derivative programs include strategies that both qualify and do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment. foreign currencies certain forecasted transactions, assets, and liabilities are exposed to foreign currency risk. we monitor our foreign currency exposures daily to maximize the economic effectiveness of our foreign currency hedge positions. foreign currency risks related to certain non-u.s. dollar-denominated investments are hedged using foreign exchange forward contracts that are designated as fair value hedging instruments. foreign currency risks related to certain euro-denominated debt are hedged using foreign exchange forward contracts that are designated as cash flow hedging instruments.certain options and forwards not designated as hedging instruments are also used to manage the variability in foreign exchange rates on certain balance sheet amounts and to manage other foreign currency exposures. interest rate interest rate risks related to certain fixed-rate debt are hedged using interest rate swaps that are designated as fair value hedging instruments to effectively convert the fixed interest rates to floating interest rates.securities held in our fixed-income portfolio are subject to different interest rate risks based on their maturities. we manage the average maturity of our fixed-income portfolio to achieve economic returns that correlate to certain broad-based fixed-income indices using option, futures, and swap contracts. these contracts are not designated as hedging instruments and are included in \u201cother contracts\u201d in the tables below.equity securities held in our equity investments portfolio are subject to market price risk. at times, we may hold options, futures, and swap contracts. these contracts are not designated as hedging instruments.credit our fixed-income portfolio is diversified and consists primarily of investment-grade securities. we use credit default swap contracts to manage credit exposures relative to broad-based indices and to facilitate portfolio diversification. these contracts are not designated as hedging instruments and are included in \u201cother contracts\u201d in the tables below.credit-risk-related contingent features certain of our counterparty agreements for derivative instruments contain provisions that require our issued and outstanding long-term unsecured debt to maintain an investment grade credit rating and require us to maintain minimum liquidity of $1.0 billion. to the extent we fail to meet these requirements, we will be required to post collateral, similar to the standard convention related to over-the-counter derivatives. as of june 30, 2023, our long-term unsecured debt rating was aaa, and cash investments were in excess of $1.0 billion. as a result, no collateral was required to be posted. 75 part iiitem 8\u00a0the following table

billion, $12.6 billion, and $9.3 billion, respectively. depreciation expense declined in fiscal year 2023 due to the change in estimated useful lives of our server and network equipment.as of june 30, 2023, we have committed $13.5 billion for the construction of new buildings, building improvements, and leasehold improvements, primarily related to datacenters.  note 8 \u2014 business combinations

as soon as information on the facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition dates becomes available, but do not exceed 12 months. adjustments in purchase price allocations may require a change in the amounts allocated to goodwill during the periods in which the adjustments are determined. any change in the goodwill amounts resulting from foreign currency translations and purchase accounting adjustments are presented as \u201cother\u201d in the table above. also included in \u201cother\u201d are business dispositions and transfers between segments due to reorganizations, as applicable. goodwill impairmentwe test goodwill for impairment annually on may 1 at the reporting unit level, primarily using a discounted cash flow methodology with a peer-based, risk-adjusted weighted average cost of capital. we believe use of a discounted cash flow approach is the most reliable indicator of the fair values of the businesses. no instances of impairment were identified in our may 1, 2023, may 1, 2022, or may 1, 2021 tests. as of june 30, 2023 and 2022, accumulated goodwill impairment was $11.3 billion. note 10 \u2014 intangible assets the components of intangible assets, all of which are finite-lived, were as follows: \u00a0 \u00a0no material impairments of intangible assets were identified during fiscal years 2023, 2022, or 2021. we estimate that we have no significant residual value related to our intangible assets.the components of intangible assets acquired during the periods presented were as follows: \u00a0 \u00a0intangible assets amortization expense was $2.5 billion, $2.0 billion, and $1.6 billion for fiscal years 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively. 80 part iiitem 8\u00a0the following table outlines the estimated future amortization

billion, respectively. the estimated fair values are based on level 2 inputs. debt in the table above is comprised of senior unsecured obligations and ranks equally with our other outstanding obligations. interest is paid semi-annually, except for the euro-denominated debt, which is paid annually. cash paid for interest on our debt for fiscal years 2023, 2022, and 2021 was $1.7 billion, $1.9 billion, and $2.0 billion, respectively. 81 part iiitem 8\u00a0the following table outlines maturities of our long-term debt, including the current portion, as of june 30, 2023: \u00a0  \u00a0 note 12 \u2014 income taxesprovision for income taxes the components of the provision for income taxes were as follows: \u00a0 \u00a082 part iiitem 8\u00a0u.s. and foreign components of income before income taxes were as follows: \u00a0 \u00a0effective tax ratethe items accounting for the difference between income taxes computed at the u.s. federal statutory rate and our effective rate were as follows: \u00a0 \u00a0in the first quarter of fiscal year 2022, we transferred certain intangible properties from our puerto rico subsidiary to the u.s. the transfer of intangible properties resulted in a $3.3 billion net income tax benefit in the first quarter of fiscal year 2022, as the value of future u.s. tax deductions exceeded the current tax liability from the u.s. global intangible low-taxed income (\u201cgilti\u201d) tax.\u00a0we have historically paid india withholding taxes on software sales through distributor withholding and tax audit assessments in india. in march 2021, the india supreme court ruled favorably in the case of engineering analysis centre of excellence private limited vs the commissioner of income tax for companies in 86 separate appeals, some dating back to 2012, holding that software sales are not subject to india withholding taxes. although we were not a party to the appeals, our software sales in india were determined to be not subject to withholding taxes. therefore, we recorded a net income tax benefit of $620 million in the third quarter of fiscal year 2021 to reflect the results of the india supreme court decision impacting fiscal year 1996 through fiscal year 2016.\u00a0the decrease from the federal statutory rate in fiscal year 2023 is primarily due to earnings taxed at lower rates in foreign jurisdictions resulting from producing and distributing our products and services through our foreign regional operations center in ireland. the decrease from the federal statutory rate in fiscal year 2022 is primarily due to the net income tax benefit related to the transfer of intangible properties, earnings taxed at lower rates in foreign jurisdictions resulting from producing and distributing our products and services through our foreign regional operations center in ireland, and tax benefits relating to stock-based compensation. the decrease from the federal statutory rate in fiscal year 2021 is primarily due to earnings taxed at lower rates in foreign jurisdictions resulting from producing and distributing our products and services through our foreign regional operations centers in ireland and puerto rico, tax benefits relating to stock-based compensation, and tax benefits from the india supreme court decision on withholding taxes. in fiscal year 2023, our foreign regional operating center in ireland, which is taxed at a rate lower than the u.s. rate, generated 81% of our foreign income before tax. in fiscal years 2022 and 2021, our foreign regional operating centers in ireland and puerto rico, which are taxed at rates lower than the u.s. rate, generated 71% and 82% of our foreign income before tax. other reconciling items, net consists primarily of tax credits and gilti tax, and in fiscal year 2021, includes tax benefits from the india supreme court decision on withholding taxes. in fiscal years 2023, 2022, and 2021, there were no individually significant other reconciling items.83 part iiitem 8\u00a0the increase in our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2023 compared to fiscal year 2022 was primarily due to a $3.3 billion net income tax benefit in the first quarter of fiscal year 2022 related to the transfer of intangible properties and a decrease in tax benefits relating to stock-based compensation. the decrease in our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2022 compared to fiscal year 2021 was primarily due to a $3.3 billion net income tax benefit in the first quarter of fiscal year 2022 related to the transfer of intangible properties, offset in part by changes in the mix of our income before income taxes between the u.s. and foreign countries, as well as tax benefits in the prior year from the india supreme court decision on withholding taxes, an agreement between the u.s. and india tax authorities related to transfer pricing, and final tax cuts and jobs act (\u201ctcja\u201d) regulations.the components of the deferred income tax assets and liabilities were as follows:\u00a0 \u00a0(a)provisions enacted in the tcja related to the capitalization\u202ffor tax purposes of\u202fresearch\u202fand development expenditures became effective on july 1, 2022. these provisions require us to capitalize research and development expenditures and amortize them on our u.s. tax return over five or fifteen years, depending on where research is conducted.deferred income tax balances reflect the effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases and are stated at enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when the taxes are paid or recovered. as of june 30, 2023, we had federal, state, and foreign net operating loss carryforwards of $509 million, $1.2 billion, and $2.3 billion, respectively. the federal and state net operating loss carryforwards have varying expiration dates ranging from fiscal year 2024 to 2043 or indefinite carryforward periods, if not utilized. the majority of our foreign net operating loss carryforwards do not expire. certain acquired net operating loss carryforwards are subject to an annual limitation but are expected to be realized with the exception of those which have a valuation allowance. as of june 30, 2023, we had $456 million federal capital loss carryforwards for u.s. tax purposes from our acquisition of nuance. the federal capital loss carryforwards are subject to an annual limitation and will expire in fiscal year 2025.84 part iiitem 8\u00a0the valuation allowance disclosed in the table above relates to the foreign net operating loss carryforwards, federal capital loss carryforwards, and other net deferred tax assets that may not be realized. income taxes paid, net of refunds, were $23.1 billion, $16.0 billion, and $13.4 billion in fiscal years 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively. uncertain tax positionsgross unrecognized tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions as of june 30, 2023, 2022, and 2021, were $17.1 billion, $15.6 billion, and $14.6 billion, respectively, which were primarily included in long-term income taxes in our consolidated balance sheets. if recognized, the resulting tax benefit would affect our effective tax rates for fiscal years 2023, 2022, and 2021 by $14.4 billion, $13.3 billion, and $12.5 billion, respectively.as of june 30, 2023, 2022, and 2021, we had accrued interest expense related to uncertain tax positions of $5.2 billion, $4.3 billion, and $4.3 billion, respectively, net of income tax benefits. the provision for income taxes for fiscal years 2023, 2022, and 2021 included interest expense related to uncertain tax positions of $918 million, $36 million, and $274 million, respectively, net of income tax benefits.the aggregate changes in the gross unrecognized tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions were as follows:   \u00a0we settled a portion of the internal revenue service (\u201cirs\u201d) audit for tax years 2004 to 2006 in fiscal year 2011. in february 2012, the irs withdrew its 2011 revenue agents report related to unresolved issues for tax years 2004 to 2006 and reopened the audit phase of the examination. we also settled a portion of the irs audit for tax years 2007 to 2009 in fiscal year 2016, and a portion of the irs audit for tax years 2010 to 2013 in fiscal year 2018. in the second quarter of fiscal year 2021, we settled an additional portion of the irs audits for tax years 2004 to 2013 and made a payment of $1.7 billion, including tax and interest. we remain under audit for tax years 2004 to 2017.as of june 30, 2023, the primary unresolved issues for the irs audits relate to transfer pricing, which could have a material impact in our consolidated financial statements when the matters are resolved. we believe our allowances for income tax contingencies are adequate. we have not received a proposed assessment for the unresolved key transfer pricing issues. we do not expect a final resolution of these issues in the next 12 months. based on the information currently available, we do not anticipate a significant increase or decrease to our tax contingencies for these issues within the next 12 months.we are subject to income tax in many jurisdictions outside the u.s. our operations in certain jurisdictions remain subject to examination for tax years 1996 to 2022, some of which are currently under audit by local tax authorities. the resolution of each of these audits is not expected to be material to our consolidated financial statements.  85part ii item 8 \u00a0 note 13 \u2014 unearned revenue unearned revenue by segment was as follows:   \u00a0changes in unearned revenue were as follows:   \u00a0revenue allocated to remaining performance obligations, which includes unearned revenue and amounts that will be invoiced and recognized as revenue in future periods, was $229 billion as of june 30, 2023, of which $224 billion is related to the commercial portion of revenue. we expect to recognize approximately 45% of this revenue over the next 12 months and the remainder thereafter. note 14 \u2014 leases we have operating and finance leases for datacenters, corporate offices, research and development facilities, microsoft experience centers, and certain equipment. our leases have remaining lease terms of less than 1 year to 18 years, some of which include options to extend the leases for up to 5

respectively. these operating and finance leases will commence between fiscal year 2024 and fiscal year 2030 with lease terms of 1 year to 18 years. \u00a0 87part ii item 8 \u00a0 note 15 \u2014 contingenciesu.s. cell phone litigation microsoft mobile oy, a subsidiary of microsoft, along with other handset manufacturers and network operators, is a defendant in 46 lawsuits, including 45 lawsuits filed in the superior court for the district of columbia by individual plaintiffs who allege that radio emissions from cellular handsets caused their brain tumors and other adverse health effects. we assumed responsibility for these claims in our agreement to acquire nokia\u2019s devices and services business and have been substituted for the nokia defendants. nine of these cases were filed in 2002 and are consolidated for certain pre-trial proceedings; the remaining cases are stayed. in a separate 2009 decision, the court of appeals for the district of columbia held that adverse health effect claims arising from the use of cellular handsets that operate within the u.s. federal communications commission radio frequency emission guidelines (\u201cfcc guidelines\u201d) are pre-empted by federal law. the plaintiffs allege that their handsets either operated outside the fcc guidelines or were manufactured before the fcc guidelines went into effect. the lawsuits also allege an industry-wide conspiracy to manipulate the science and testing around emission guidelines. in 2013, the defendants in the consolidated cases moved to exclude the plaintiffs\u2019 expert evidence of general causation on the basis of flawed scientific methodologies. in 2014, the trial court granted in part and denied in part the defendants\u2019 motion to exclude the plaintiffs\u2019 general causation experts. the defendants filed an interlocutory appeal to the district of columbia court of appeals challenging the standard for evaluating expert scientific evidence. in october 2016, the court of appeals issued its decision adopting the standard advocated by the defendants and remanding the cases to the trial court for further proceedings under that standard. the plaintiffs have filed supplemental expert evidence, portions of which were stricken by the court.  a hearing on general causation took place in september of 2022. in april of 2023, the court granted defendants\u2019 motion to strike the testimony of plaintiffs\u2019 experts that cell phones cause brain cancer and entered an order excluding all of plaintiffs\u2019 experts from testifying.irish data protection commission matterin 2018, the irish data protection commission (\u201cidpc\u201d) began investigating a complaint against linkedin as to whether linkedin\u2019s targeted advertising practices violated the recently implemented european union general data protection regulation (\u201cgdpr\u201d). microsoft cooperated throughout the period of inquiry. in april 2023, the idpc provided linkedin with a non-public preliminary draft decision alleging gdpr violations and proposing a fine. microsoft intends to challenge the preliminary draft decision. there is no set timeline for the idpc to issue a final decision.other contingencies we also are subject to a variety of other claims and suits that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of our business. although management currently believes that resolving claims against us, individually or in aggregate, will not have a material adverse impact in our consolidated financial statements, these matters are subject to inherent uncertainties and management\u2019s view of these matters may change in the future. as of june 30, 2023, we accrued aggregate legal liabilities of $617 million. while we intend to defend these matters vigorously, adverse outcomes that we estimate could reach approximately $600 million in aggregate beyond recorded amounts are reasonably possible. were unfavorable final outcomes to occur, there exists the possibility of a material adverse impact in our consolidated financial statements for the period in which the effects become reasonably estimable.  88part ii item 8 \u00a0

including our chief operating decision maker, who is also our chief executive officer, reviews certain financial information, including segmented internal profit and loss statements prepared on a basis not consistent with gaap. during the periods presented, we reported our financial performance based on the following segments: productivity and business processes, intelligent cloud, and more personal computing. we have recast certain prior period amounts to conform to the way we internally manage and monitor our business.our reportable segments are described below. productivity and business processes our productivity and business processes segment consists of products and services in our portfolio of productivity, communication, and information services, spanning a variety of devices and platforms. this segment primarily comprises:\u2022office commercial (office 365 subscriptions, the office 365 portion of microsoft 365 commercial subscriptions, and office licensed

recognized and costs incurred by one segment may benefit other segments. revenue from certain contracts is allocated among the segments based on the relative value of the underlying products and services, which can include allocation based on actual prices charged, prices when sold separately, or estimated costs plus a profit margin. cost of revenue is allocated in certain cases based on a relative revenue methodology. operating expenses that are allocated primarily include those relating to marketing of products and services from which multiple segments benefit and are generally

the controlling statutory company and with countries over 10% of the total shown separately, were as follows:\u00a0  \u00a0 95part ii item 8 \u00a0 report of independent registered public accounting firm to the stockholders and the board of directors of microsoft corporation  opinion on the financial statements we have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of microsoft corporation and subsidiaries (the \"company\") as of june 30, 2023 and 2022, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, cash flows, and stockholders' equity, for each of the three years in the period ended june 30, 2023, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the \"financial statements\"). in our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the company as of june 30, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended june 30, 2023, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america. we have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board (united states) (pcaob), the company's internal control over financial reporting as of june 30, 2023, based on criteria established in internal control \u2014 integrated framework (2013) issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission and our report dated july 27, 2023, expressed an unqualified opinion on the company's internal control over financial reporting. basis for opinion these financial statements are the responsibility of the company's management. our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company's financial statements based on our audits. we are a public accounting firm registered with the pcaob and are required to be independent with respect to the company in accordance with the u.s. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the securities and exchange commission and the pcaob. we conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the pcaob. those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. we believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. critical audit matters the critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. the communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. revenue recognition \u2013 refer to note 1 to the financial statements critical audit matter description the company recognizes revenue upon transfer of control of promised products or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration the company expects to receive in exchange for those products or services. the company offers customers the ability to acquire multiple licenses of software products and services, including cloud-based services, in its customer agreements through its volume licensing programs. 96part ii item 8 \u00a0 significant judgment is exercised by the company in determining revenue recognition for these customer agreements, and includes the following: \u2022determination of whether products and services are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately versus together, such as software licenses and related services that are sold with cloud-based services. \u2022the pattern of delivery (i.e., timing of when revenue is recognized) for each distinct performance obligation. \u2022identification and treatment of contract terms that may impact the timing and amount of revenue recognized (e.g., variable consideration, optional purchases, and free services).  \u2022determination of stand-alone selling prices for each distinct performance obligation and for products and services that are not sold separately. given these factors and due to the volume of transactions, the related audit effort in evaluating management's judgments in determining revenue recognition for these customer agreements was extensive and required a high degree of auditor judgment. how the critical audit matter was addressed in the audit our principal audit procedures related to the company's revenue recognition for these customer agreements included the following: income taxes \u2013 uncertain tax positions \u2013 refer to note 12 to the financial statements critical audit matter description the company's long-term income taxes liability includes uncertain tax positions related to transfer pricing issues that remain unresolved with the internal revenue service (\"irs\"). the company remains under irs audit, or subject to irs audit, for tax years subsequent to 2003. while the company has settled a portion of the irs audits, resolution of the remaining matters could have a material impact on the company's financial statements.  conclusions on recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions involve significant estimates and management judgment and include complex considerations of the internal revenue code, related regulations, tax case laws, and prior-year audit settlements. given the complexity and the subjective nature of the transfer pricing issues that remain unresolved with the irs, evaluating management's estimates relating to their determination of uncertain tax positions required extensive audit effort and a high degree of auditor judgment, including involvement of our tax specialists. 97part ii item 8 \u00a0 how the critical audit matter was addressed in the audit our principal audit procedures to evaluate management's estimates of uncertain tax positions related to unresolved transfer pricing issues included the following: \u2022we evaluated the appropriateness and consistency of management's methods and assumptions used in the identification, recognition, measurement, and disclosure of uncertain tax positions, which included testing the effectiveness of the related internal controls. \u2022we read and evaluated management's documentation, including relevant accounting policies and information obtained by management from outside tax specialists, that detailed the basis of the uncertain tax positions. \u2022we tested the reasonableness of management's judgments regarding the future resolution of the uncertain tax positions, including an evaluation of the technical merits of the uncertain tax positions. \u2022for those uncertain tax positions that had not been effectively settled, we evaluated whether management had appropriately considered new information that could significantly change the recognition, measurement or disclosure of the uncertain tax positions. \u2022we evaluated the reasonableness of management's estimates by considering how tax law, including statutes, regulations and case law, impacted management's judgments. \u00a0 /s/ deloitte & touche llp \u00a0 seattle, washington july 27, 2023 \u00a0 we have served as the company's auditor since 1983. 98part

participation of our management, including the chief executive officer and chief financial officer, we have evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as required by

controls and procedures are effective.  report of management on internal control over financial reporting  our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for the company. internal control over financial reporting is a process to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting for external purposes

and fairly reflect our transactions; providing reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary for preparation of our consolidated financial statements; providing reasonable assurance that receipts and expenditures of company assets are made in accordance with management authorization; and providing reasonable assurance that unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of company assets that could have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements would be prevented or detected on a timely basis. because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting is not intended to provide absolute assurance that a misstatement of our consolidated financial statements would be prevented or detected.  management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in internal control \u2013 integrated framework (2013) issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission. based on this evaluation, management concluded that the company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of june 30, 2023. there were no changes in our

company in accordance with the u.s. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the securities and exchange commission and the pcaob. we conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the pcaob. those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. we believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. definition and limitations of internal control over financial reporting a company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. a company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. \u00a0 /s/ deloitte & touche llp \u00a0 seattle, washington july 27, 2023 \u00a0 100", "table": [{}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {"0": [["commercial remaining

i item 1a \u00a0 business model competition  companies compete with us based on a growing variety of business models.        the competitive pressures described above may cause decreased sales volumes, price reductions, and/or increased operating costs, such as for research and development, marketing, and sales incentives. this may lead to lower revenue, gross margins, and operating income.  our increasing focus on cloud-based services presents execution and competitive risks.\u00a0a growing part of our business involves cloud-based services available across the spectrum of computing devices. our strategic vision is to compete and grow by building best-in-class platforms and productivity services for an intelligent cloud and an intelligent edge infused with artificial intelligence (\u201cai\u201d). at the same time, our competitors are rapidly developing and deploying cloud-based services for consumers and business customers. pricing and delivery models are evolving. devices and form factors influence how users access services in the cloud and sometimes the user\u2019s choice of which cloud-based services to use. we are devoting significant resources to develop and deploy our cloud-based strategies. the windows ecosystem must continue to evolve with this changing environment. we embrace cultural and organizational changes to drive accountability and eliminate obstacles to innovation. our intelligent cloud and intelligent edge worldview is connected with the growth of the internet of things (\u201ciot\u201d). our success in the iot will depend on the level of adoption of our offerings such as azure, azure stack, azure iot edge, and azure sphere. we may not establish market share sufficient to achieve scale necessary to achieve our business objectives. besides software development costs, we are incurring costs to build and maintain infrastructure to support cloud computing services. these costs will reduce the operating margins we have previously achieved. whether we succeed in cloud-based services depends on our execution in several areas, including:            it is uncertain whether our strategies will attract the users or generate the revenue required to succeed. if we are not effective in executing organizational and technical changes to increase efficiency and accelerate innovation, or if we fail to generate sufficient usage of our new products and services, we may not grow revenue in line with the infrastructure and development investments described above. this may negatively impact gross margins and operating income.  23part i item 1a \u00a0 risks relating to the evolution of our business we make significant investments in products and services that may not achieve expected returns.\u00a0we will continue to make significant investments in research, development, and marketing for existing products, services, and technologies, including the windows operating system, microsoft 365, office, bing, sql server, windows server, azure, office 365, xbox, linkedin, and other products and services. we also invest in the development and acquisition of a variety of hardware for productivity, communication, and entertainment including pcs, tablets, gaming devices, and hololens. investments in new technology are speculative. commercial success depends on many factors, including innovativeness, developer support, and effective distribution and marketing. if customers do not perceive our latest offerings as providing significant new functionality or other value, they may reduce their purchases of new software and hardware products or upgrades, unfavorably affecting revenue. we may not achieve significant revenue from new product, service, and distribution channel investments for several years, if at all. new products and services may not be profitable, and even if they are profitable, operating margins for some new products and businesses will not be as high as the margins we have experienced historically. we may not get engagement in certain features, like edge and bing, that drive post-sale monetization opportunities. our data handling practices across our products and services will continue to be under scrutiny and perceptions of mismanagement, driven by regulatory activity or negative public reaction to our practices or product experiences, which could negatively impact product and feature adoption, product design, and product quality. developing new technologies is complex. it can require long development and testing periods. significant delays in new releases or significant problems in creating new products or services could adversely affect our revenue.  acquisitions, joint ventures, and strategic alliances may have an adverse effect on our business.\u00a0we expect to continue making acquisitions and entering into joint ventures and strategic alliances as part of our long-term business strategy. for example, in october 2018 we completed our acquisition of github, inc. (\u201cgithub\u201d) for $7.5 billion, in march 2021 we completed our acquisition of zenimax media inc. for $8.1 billion, and in april 2021 we announced a definitive agreement to acquire nuance communications, inc. for $19.7 billion.\u00a0these acquisitions and other transactions and arrangements involve significant challenges and risks, including that they do not advance our business strategy, that we get an unsatisfactory return on our investment, that we have difficulty integrating and retaining new employees, business systems, and technology, that they distract management from our other businesses, or that announced transactions may not be completed. if an arrangement fails to adequately anticipate changing circumstances and interests of a party, it may result in early termination or renegotiation of the arrangement. the success of these transactions and arrangements will depend in part on our ability to leverage them to enhance our existing products and services or develop compelling new ones. it may take longer than expected to realize the full benefits from these transactions and arrangements such as increased revenue or enhanced efficiencies, or the benefits may ultimately be smaller than we expected. these events could adversely affect our consolidated financial statements.  if our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets become impaired, we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings.\u00a0we acquire other companies and intangible assets and may not realize all the economic benefit from those acquisitions, which could cause an impairment of goodwill or intangibles. we review our amortizable intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. we test goodwill for impairment at least annually. factors that may be a change in circumstances, indicating that the carrying value of our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets may not be recoverable, include a decline in our stock price and market capitalization, reduced future cash flow estimates, and slower growth rates in industry segments in which we participate. we have in the past recorded, and may in the future be required to record, a significant charge in our consolidated financial statements during the period in which any impairment of our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets is determined, negatively affecting our results of operations.  24part i item 1a \u00a0 cybersecurity, data privacy, and platform abuse risks cyberattacks and security vulnerabilities could lead to reduced revenue, increased costs, liability claims, or harm to our reputation or competitive position.  security of our information technology threats to it security can take a variety of forms. individual and groups of hackers and sophisticated organizations, including state-sponsored organizations or nation-states, continuously undertake attacks that pose threats to our customers and our it.\u00a0these actors may use a wide variety of methods, which may include developing and deploying malicious software or exploiting vulnerabilities in hardware, software, or other infrastructure in order to attack our products and services or gain access to our networks and datacenters, using social engineering techniques to induce our employees, users, partners, or customers to disclose passwords or other sensitive information or take other actions to gain access to our data or our users\u2019 or customers\u2019 data, or acting in a coordinated manner to launch distributed denial of service or other coordinated attacks. nation state and state sponsored actors can deploy significant resources to plan and carry out exploits. inadequate account security practices may also result in unauthorized access to confidential data. for example, system administrators may fail to timely remove employee account access when no longer appropriate. employees or third parties may intentionally compromise our or our users\u2019 security or systems or reveal confidential information. malicious actors may employ the it supply chain to introduce malware through software updates or compromised supplier accounts or hardware. cyberthreats are constantly evolving and becoming increasingly sophisticated and complex, increasing the difficulty of detecting and successfully defending against them. we may have no current capability to detect certain vulnerabilities, which may allow them to persist in the environment over long periods of time. cyberthreats can have cascading impacts that unfold with increasing speed across our internal networks and systems and those of our partners and customers. breaches of our facilities, network, or data security could disrupt the security of our systems and business applications, impair our ability to provide services to our customers and protect the privacy of their data, result in product development delays, compromise confidential or technical business information harming our reputation or competitive position, result in theft or misuse of our intellectual property or other assets, require us to allocate more resources to improve technologies or remediate the impacts of attacks, or otherwise adversely affect our business. the cyberattacks uncovered in late 2020 known as \u201csolorigate\u201d or \u201cnobelium\u201d are an example of a supply chain attack where malware was introduced to a software provider\u2019s customers, including us, through software updates. the attackers were later able to create false credentials that appeared legitimate to certain customers\u2019 systems. we may be targets of further attacks similar to solorigate/nobelium as both a supplier and consumer of it. in addition, our internal it environment continues to evolve. often, we are early adopters of new devices and technologies. we embrace new ways of sharing data and communicating internally and with partners and customers using methods such as social networking and other consumer-oriented technologies. our business policies and internal security controls may not keep pace with these changes as new threats emerge. 25part i item 1a \u00a0 security of our products, services, devices, and customers\u2019 data the security of our products and services is important in our customers\u2019 decisions to purchase or use our products or services across cloud and on-premises environments. security threats are a significant challenge to companies like us whose business is providing technology products and services to others. threats to our own it infrastructure can also affect our customers. customers using our cloud-based services rely on the security of our infrastructure, including hardware and other elements provided by third parties, to ensure the reliability of our services and the protection of their data. adversaries tend to focus their efforts on the most popular operating systems, programs, and services, including many of ours, and we expect that to continue. in addition, adversaries can attack our customers\u2019 on-premises or cloud environments, sometimes exploiting previously unknown (\u201czero day\u201d) vulnerabilities, such as occurred in early calendar year 2021 with several of our exchange server on-premises products. vulnerabilities in these or any product can persist even after we have issued security patches if customers have not installed the most recent updates, or if the attackers exploited the vulnerabilities before patching to install additional malware to further compromise customers\u2019 systems. adversaries will continue to attack customers using our cloud services as customers embrace digital transformation. adversaries that acquire user account information can use that information to compromise our users\u2019 accounts, including where accounts share the same attributes as passwords. inadequate account security practices may also result in unauthorized access, and user activity may result in ransomware or other malicious software impacting a customer\u2019s use of our products or services. we are increasingly incorporating open source software into our products. there may be vulnerabilities in open source software that may make our products susceptible to cyberattacks. our customers operate complex it systems with third-party hardware and software from multiple vendors that may include systems acquired over many years. they expect our products and services to support all these systems and products, including those that no longer incorporate the strongest current security advances or standards. as a result, we may not be able to discontinue support in our services for a product, service, standard, or feature solely because a more secure alternative is available. failure to utilize the most current security advances and standards can increase our customers\u2019 vulnerability to attack. further, customers of widely varied size and technical sophistication use our technology, and consequently may have limited capabilities and resources to help them adopt and implement state of the art cybersecurity practices and technologies. in addition, we must account for this wide variation of technical sophistication when defining default settings for our products and services, including security default settings, as these settings may limit or otherwise impact other aspects of it operations and some customers may have limited capability to review and reset these defaults. the solorigate/nobelium or similar cyberattacks may adversely impact our customers even if our production services are not directly compromised. we are committed to notifying our customers whose systems have been impacted as we become aware and have available information and actions for customers to help protect themselves. we are also committed to providing guidance and support on detection, tracking, and remediation. we may not be able to detect the existence or extent of these attacks for all of our customers or have information on how to detect or track an attack, especially where an attack involves on-premises software such as exchange server where we may have no or limited visibility into our customers\u2019 computing environments. development and deployment of defensive measures to defend against security threats to our internal it systems, our cloud-based services, and our customers\u2019 systems, we must continuously engineer more secure products and services, enhance security and reliability features, improve the deployment of software updates to address security vulnerabilities in our own products as well as those provided by others, develop mitigation technologies that help to secure customers from attacks even when software updates are not deployed, maintain the digital security infrastructure that protects the integrity of our network, products, and services, and provide security tools such as firewalls, anti-virus software, and advanced security and information about the need to deploy security measures and the impact of doing so. customers in certain industries such as financial services, health care, and government may have enhanced or specialized requirements to which we must engineer our product and services. 26part i item 1a \u00a0 the cost of measures to protect products and customer-facing services could reduce our operating margins. if we fail to do these things well, actual or perceived security vulnerabilities in our products and services, data corruption issues, or reduced performance could harm our reputation and lead customers to reduce or delay future purchases of products or subscriptions to services, or to use competing products or services. customers may also spend more on protecting their existing computer systems from attack, which could delay adoption of additional products or services. customers, and third parties granted access to their systems, may fail to update their systems, continue to run software or operating systems we no longer support, or may fail timely to install or enable security patches, or may otherwise fail to adopt adequate security practices. any of these could adversely affect our reputation and revenue. actual or perceived vulnerabilities may lead to claims against us. our license agreements typically contain provisions that eliminate or limit our exposure to liability, but there is no assurance these provisions will withstand legal challenges. at times, to achieve commercial objectives, we may enter into agreements with larger liability exposure to customers.  our products operate in conjunction with and are dependent on products and components across a broad ecosystem of third parties. if there is a security vulnerability in one of these components, and if there is a security exploit targeting it, we could face increased costs, liability claims, reduced revenue, or harm to our reputation or competitive position. disclosure and misuse of personal data could result in liability and harm our reputation.\u00a0as we continue to grow the number and scale of our cloud-based offerings, we store and process increasingly large amounts of personally identifiable information of our customers and users. the continued occurrence of high-profile data breaches provides evidence of an external environment increasingly hostile to information security. despite our efforts to improve the security controls across our business groups and geographies, it is possible our security controls over personal data, our training of employees and third parties on data security, and other practices we follow may not prevent the improper disclosure or misuse of customer or user data we or our vendors store and manage. in addition, third parties who have limited access to our customer or user data may use this data in unauthorized ways. improper disclosure or misuse could harm our reputation, lead to legal exposure to customers or users, or subject us to liability under laws that protect personal data, resulting in increased costs or loss of revenue. our software products and services also enable our customers and users to store and process personal data on-premises or, increasingly, in a cloud-based environment we host. government authorities can sometimes require us to produce customer or user data in response to valid legal orders. in the u.s. and elsewhere, we advocate for transparency concerning these requests and appropriate limitations on government authority to compel disclosure. despite our efforts to protect customer and user data, perceptions that the collection, use, and retention of personal information is not satisfactorily protected could inhibit sales of our products or services and could limit adoption of our cloud-based solutions by consumers, businesses, and government entities. additional security measures we may take to address customer or user concerns, or constraints on our flexibility to determine where and how to operate datacenters in response to customer or user expectations or governmental rules or actions, may cause higher operating expenses or hinder growth of our products and services.  we may not be able to protect information in our products and services from use by others. linkedin and other microsoft products and services contain valuable information and content protected by contractual restrictions or technical measures. in certain cases, we have made commitments to our members and users to limit access to or use of this information. changes in the law or interpretations of the law may weaken our ability to prevent third parties from scraping or gathering information or content through use of bots or other measures and using it for their own benefit, thus diminishing the value of our products and services. abuse of our platforms may harm our reputation or user engagement.  advertising, professional, and social platform abuses  for platform products and services that provide content or host ads that come from or can be influenced by third parties, including github, linkedin, microsoft advertising, msn, and xbox, our reputation or user engagement may be negatively affected by activity that is hostile or inappropriate. this activity may come from users impersonating other people or organizations, use of our products or services to spread terrorist or violent extremist content or to disseminate information that may be viewed as misleading or intended to manipulate the opinions of our users, or the use of our products or services that violates our terms of service or otherwise for objectionable or illegal ends. preventing or responding to these actions may require us to make substantial investments in people and technology and these investments may not be successful, adversely affecting our business and consolidated financial statements. 27part i item 1a \u00a0 digital safety and service misuse our hosted consumer services as well as our enterprise services may be used by third parties to disseminate harmful or illegal content in violation of our terms or applicable law. we may not proactively discover such content due to scale and the limitations of existing technologies, and when discovered by users, such content may negatively affect our reputation, our brands, and user engagement. regulations and other initiatives to make platforms responsible for preventing or eliminating harmful content online are gaining momentum and we expect this to continue. we may be subject to enhanced regulatory oversight, civil or criminal liability, or reputational damage if we fail to comply with content moderation regulations, adversely affecting our business and consolidated financial statements. the development of the iot presents security, privacy, and execution risks. to support the growth of the intelligent cloud and the intelligent edge, we are developing products, services, and technologies to power the iot, a network of distributed and interconnected devices employing sensors, data, and computing capabilities including ai. the iot\u2019s great potential also carries substantial risks. iot products and services may contain defects in design, manufacture, or operation that make them insecure or ineffective for their intended purposes. an iot solution has multiple layers of hardware, sensors, processors, software, and firmware, several of which we may not develop or control. each layer, including the weakest layer, can impact the security of the whole system. many iot devices have limited interfaces and ability to be updated or patched. iot solutions may collect large amounts of data, and our handling of iot data may not satisfy customers or regulatory requirements. iot scenarios may increasingly affect personal health and safety. if iot solutions that include our technologies do not work as intended, violate the law, or harm individuals or businesses, we may be subject to legal claims or enforcement actions. these risks, if realized, may increase our costs, damage our reputation or brands, or negatively impact our revenues or margins.  issues in the use of ai in our offerings may result in reputational harm or liability. we are building ai into many of our offerings and we expect this element of our business to grow. we envision a future in which ai operating in our devices, applications, and the cloud helps our customers be more productive in their work and personal lives. as with many disruptive innovations, ai presents risks and challenges that could affect its adoption, and therefore our business. ai algorithms may be flawed. datasets may be insufficient or contain biased information. inappropriate or controversial data practices by microsoft or others could impair the acceptance of ai solutions. these deficiencies could undermine the decisions, predictions, or analysis ai applications produce, subjecting us to competitive harm, legal liability, and brand or reputational harm. some ai scenarios present ethical issues. if we enable or offer ai solutions that are controversial because of their impact on human rights, privacy, employment, or other social issues, we may experience brand or reputational harm.  operational risks we may have excessive outages, data losses, and disruptions of our online services if we fail to maintain an adequate operations infrastructure.\u00a0our increasing user traffic, growth in services, and the complexity of our products and services demand more computing power. we spend substantial amounts to build, purchase, or lease datacenters and equipment and to upgrade our technology and network infrastructure to handle more traffic on our websites and in our datacenters. these demands continue to increase as we introduce new products and services and support the growth of existing services such as bing, azure, microsoft account services, microsoft 365, microsoft teams, dynamics 365, onedrive, sharepoint online, skype, xbox, and outlook.com. we are rapidly growing our business of providing a platform and back-end hosting for services provided by third parties to their end users. maintaining, securing, and expanding this infrastructure is expensive and complex, and requires development of principles for datacenter builds in geographies with higher safety risks. it requires that we maintain an internet connectivity infrastructure and storage and compute capacity that is robust and reliable within competitive and regulatory constraints that continue to evolve. inefficiencies or operational failures, including temporary or permanent loss of customer data, insufficient internet connectivity, or inadequate storage and compute capacity, could diminish the quality of our products, services, and user experience resulting in contractual liability, claims by customers and other third parties, regulatory actions, damage to our reputation, and loss of current and potential users, subscribers, and advertisers, each of which may adversely impact our consolidated financial statements.  we may experience quality or supply problems.\u00a0our hardware products such as xbox consoles, surface devices, and other devices we design and market are highly complex and can have defects in design, manufacture, or associated software. we could incur significant expenses, lost revenue, and reputational harm as a result of recalls, safety alerts, or product liability claims if we fail to prevent, detect, or address such issues through design, testing, or warranty repairs.  28part i item 1a \u00a0 our software products and services also may experience quality or reliability problems. the highly sophisticated software we develop may contain bugs and other defects that interfere with their intended operation. our customers increasingly rely on us for critical business functions and multiple workloads. many of our products and services are interdependent with one another. each of these circumstances potentially magnifies the impact of quality or reliability issues. any defects we do not detect and fix in pre-release testing could cause reduced sales and revenue, damage to our reputation, repair or remediation costs, delays in the release of new products or versions, or legal liability. although our license agreements typically contain provisions that eliminate or limit our exposure to liability, there is no assurance these provisions will withstand legal challenge. we acquire some device and datacenter components from sole suppliers. our competitors use some of the same suppliers and their demand for hardware components can affect the capacity available to us. if a component from a sole-source supplier is delayed or becomes unavailable, whether because of supplier capacity constraint, industry shortages, legal or regulatory changes that restrict supply sources, or other reasons, we may not obtain timely replacement supplies, resulting in reduced sales or inadequate datacenter capacity. component shortages, excess or obsolete inventory, or price reductions resulting in inventory adjustments may increase our cost of revenue. xbox consoles, surface devices, datacenter servers, and other hardware are assembled in asia and other geographies that may be subject to disruptions in the supply chain, resulting in shortages that would affect our revenue and operating margins. these same risks would apply to any other hardware and software products we may offer.  legal, regulatory, and litigation risks government litigation and regulatory activity relating to competition rules may limit how we design and market our products.\u00a0as a leading global software and device maker, government agencies closely scrutinize us under u.s. and foreign competition laws. governments are actively enforcing competition laws and regulations, and this includes scrutiny in potentially large markets such as the european union (\u201ceu\u201d), the u.s., and china. some jurisdictions also allow competitors or consumers to assert claims of anti-competitive conduct. u.s. federal and state antitrust authorities have previously brought enforcement actions and continue to scrutinize our business.  the european commission (\u201cthe commission\u201d) closely scrutinizes the design of high-volume microsoft products and the terms on which we make certain technologies used in these products, such as file formats, programming interfaces, and protocols, available to other companies. flagship product releases such as windows can receive significant scrutiny under competition laws. for example, in 2004, the commission ordered us to create new versions of our windows operating system that do not include certain multimedia technologies and to provide our competitors with specifications for how to implement certain proprietary windows communications protocols in their own products. in 2009, the commission accepted a set of commitments we offered to address the commission\u2019s concerns relating to competition in web browsing software, including an undertaking to address commission concerns relating to interoperability. the web browsing commitments expired in 2014. the remaining obligations may limit our ability to innovate in windows or other products in the future, diminish the developer appeal of the windows platform, and increase our product development costs. the availability of licenses related to protocols and file formats may enable competitors to develop software products that better mimic the functionality of our products, which could hamper sales of our\u00a0products.  our portfolio of first-party devices continues to grow; at the same time our oem partners offer a large variety of devices for our platforms. as a result, increasingly we both cooperate and compete with our oem partners, creating a risk that we fail to do so in compliance with competition rules. regulatory scrutiny in this area may increase. certain foreign governments, particularly in china and other countries in asia, have advanced arguments under their competition laws that exert downward pressure on royalties for our intellectual property.  government regulatory actions and court decisions such as these may result in fines or hinder our ability to provide the benefits of our software to consumers and businesses, reducing the attractiveness of our products and the revenue that come from them. new competition law actions could be initiated, potentially using previous actions as precedent. the outcome of such actions, or steps taken to avoid them, could adversely affect us in a variety of ways, including:    29part i item 1a \u00a0       our global operations subject us to potential consequences under anti-corruption, trade, and other laws and regulations.\u00a0the foreign corrupt practices act (\u201cfcpa\u201d) and other anti-corruption laws and regulations (\u201canti-corruption laws\u201d) prohibit corrupt payments by our employees, vendors, or agents, and the accounting provisions of the fcpa require us to maintain accurate books and records and adequate internal controls. from time to time, we receive inquiries from authorities in the u.s. and elsewhere which may be based on reports from employees and others about our business activities outside the u.s. and our compliance with anti-corruption laws. periodically, we receive such reports directly and investigate them. on july 22, 2019, our hungarian subsidiary entered into a non-prosecution agreement (\u201cnpa\u201d) with the u.s. department of justice (\u201cdoj\u201d) and we agreed to the terms of a cease and desist order with the securities and exchange commission.\u202fthese agreements required us to pay $25.3 million in monetary penalties, disgorgement, and interest pertaining to activities at microsoft\u2019s subsidiary in hungary.\u00a0the npa, which has a three-year term, also contains certain ongoing compliance requirements, including the obligations to disclose to the doj issues that may implicate the fcpa and to cooperate in any inquiries. most countries in which we operate also have competition laws that prohibit competitors from colluding or otherwise attempting to reduce competition between themselves. while we devote substantial resources to our u.s. and international compliance programs and have implemented policies, training, and internal controls designed to reduce the risk of corrupt payments and collusive activity, our employees, vendors, or agents may violate our policies. our failure to comply with anti-corruption laws or competition laws could result in significant fines and penalties, criminal sanctions against us, our officers, or our employees, prohibitions on the conduct of our business, and damage to our reputation.  increasing trade laws, policies, sanctions, and other regulatory requirements also affect our operations in and outside the u.s. relating to trade and investment. economic sanctions in the u.s., the eu, and other countries prohibit most business with restricted entities or countries such as crimea, cuba, iran, north korea, and syria. u.s. export controls restrict microsoft from offering many of its products and services to, or making investments in, certain entities in specified countries. u.s. import controls restrict us from integrating certain information and communication technologies into our supply chain and allow for government review of transactions involving information and communications technology from countries determined to be foreign adversaries. non-compliance could result in reputational harm, operational delays, monetary fines, loss of export privileges, or criminal sanctions. other regulatory areas that may apply to our products and online services offerings include requirements related to user privacy, telecommunications, data storage and protection, advertising, and online content. for example, some regulators are taking the position that our offerings such as microsoft teams and skype are covered by existing laws regulating telecommunications services, and some new laws, including eu member state laws under the european electronic communications code, are defining more of our services as regulated telecommunications services. this trend may continue and will result in these offerings being subjected to additional data protection, security, and law enforcement surveillance obligations. regulators may assert that our collection, use, and management of customer and other data is inconsistent with their laws and regulations. legislative or regulatory action relating to cybersecurity requirements may increase the costs to develop, implement, or secure our products and services. legislative and regulatory action is emerging in the areas of ai and content moderation, which could increase costs or restrict opportunity. applying these laws and regulations to our business is often unclear, subject to change over time, and sometimes may conflict from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. additionally, these laws and governments\u2019 approach to their enforcement, and our products and services, are continuing to evolve. compliance with these types of regulation may involve significant costs or require changes in products or business practices that result in reduced revenue. noncompliance could result in the imposition of penalties or orders we stop the alleged noncompliant activity.  we strive to empower all people and organizations to achieve more, and accessibility of our products is an important aspect of this goal. there is increasing pressure from advocacy groups, regulators, competitors, customers, and other stakeholders to make technology more accessible. if our products do not meet customer expectations or global accessibility requirements, we could lose sales opportunities or face regulatory or legal actions. 30part i item 1a \u00a0 laws and regulations relating to the handling of personal data may impede the adoption of our services or result in increased costs, legal claims, fines against us, or reputational damage.\u00a0the growth of our internet- and cloud-based services internationally relies increasingly on the movement of data across national boundaries. legal requirements relating to the collection, storage, handling, and transfer of personal data continue to evolve. for example, in july 2020 the court of justice of the eu invalidated a framework called privacy shield for companies to transfer data from eu member states to the united states. this ruling has led to uncertainty about the legal requirements for data transfers from the eu under other legal mechanisms. potential new rules and restrictions on the flow of data across borders could increase the cost and complexity of delivering our products and services in some markets. in may 2018, the eu general data protection regulation (\u201cgdpr\u201d), became effective.\u00a0the law, which applies to all of our activities conducted from an establishment in the eu or related to products and services offered in the eu, imposes a range of compliance obligations regarding the handling of personal data. engineering efforts to build and maintain capabilities to facilitate compliance with the law have entailed substantial expense and the diversion of engineering resources from other projects and may continue to do so. we might experience reduced demand for our offerings if we are unable to engineer products that meet our legal duties or help our customers meet their obligations under the gdpr or other data regulations, or if our implementation to comply with the gdpr makes our offerings less attractive. the gdpr imposes significant new obligations and compliance with these obligations depends in part on how particular regulators interpret and apply them. if we fail to comply with the gdpr, or if regulators assert we have failed to comply with the gdpr, it may lead to regulatory enforcement actions, which can result in monetary penalties of up to 4% of worldwide revenue, private lawsuits, reputational damage, and loss of customers. countries around the world, and states in the u.s. such as california, colorado, and virginia, have adopted, or are considering adopting or expanding, laws and regulations imposing obligations regarding the handling of personal data. the company\u2019s investment in gaining insights from data is becoming central to the value of the services we deliver to customers, to our operational efficiency and key opportunities in monetization, customer perceptions of quality, and operational efficiency. our ability to use data in this way may be constrained by regulatory developments that impede realizing the expected return from this investment. ongoing legal analyses, reviews, and inquiries by regulators of microsoft practices, or relevant practices of other organizations, may result in burdensome or inconsistent requirements, including data sovereignty and localization requirements, affecting the location, movement, collection, and use of our customer and internal employee data as well as the management of that data. compliance with applicable laws and regulations regarding personal data may require changes in services, business practices, or internal systems that result in increased costs, lower revenue, reduced efficiency, or greater difficulty in competing with foreign-based firms. compliance with data regulations might limit our ability to innovate or offer certain features and functionality in some jurisdictions where we operate. failure to comply with existing or new rules may result in significant penalties or orders to stop the alleged noncompliant activity, as well as negative publicity and diversion of management time and effort.  we have claims and lawsuits against us that may result in adverse outcomes.\u00a0we are subject to a variety of claims and lawsuits. these claims may arise from a wide variety of business practices and initiatives, including major new product releases such as windows, significant business transactions, warranty or product claims, and employment practices. adverse outcomes in some or all of these claims may result in significant monetary damages or injunctive relief that could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business. the litigation and other claims are subject to inherent uncertainties and management\u2019s view of these matters may change in the future. a material adverse impact in our consolidated financial statements could occur for the period in which the effect of an unfavorable outcome becomes probable and reasonably estimable.  our business with government customers may present additional uncertainties. we derive substantial revenue from government contracts. government contracts generally can present risks and challenges not present in private commercial agreements. for instance, we may be subject to government audits and investigations relating to these contracts, we could be suspended or debarred as a governmental contractor, we could incur civil and criminal fines and penalties, and under certain circumstances contracts may be rescinded. some agreements may allow a government to terminate without cause and provide for higher liability limits for certain losses.\u00a0some contracts may be subject to periodic funding approval, reductions, or delays which could adversely impact public-sector demand for our products and services. these events could negatively impact our results of operations, financial condition, and reputation.  31part i item 1a \u00a0 we may have additional tax liabilities.\u00a0we are subject to income taxes in the u.s. and many foreign jurisdictions. significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes. in the course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. for example, compliance with the 2017 united states tax cuts and jobs act (\u201ctcja\u201d) and possible future legislative changes may require the collection of information not regularly produced within the company, the use of estimates in our consolidated financial statements, and the exercise of significant judgment in accounting for its provisions. as regulations and guidance evolve with respect to the tcja or possible future legislative changes, and as we gather more information and perform more analysis, our results may differ from previous estimates and may materially affect our consolidated financial statements. we regularly are under audit by tax authorities in different jurisdictions. although we believe that our provision for income taxes and our tax estimates are reasonable, tax authorities may disagree with certain positions we have taken. in addition, economic\u00a0and political\u00a0pressures to increase tax revenue in various jurisdictions may make resolving tax disputes favorably more difficult. we are currently under internal revenue service audit for prior tax years, with the primary unresolved issues relating to transfer pricing. the final resolution of those audits, and other audits or litigation, may differ from the amounts recorded in our consolidated financial statements and may materially affect our consolidated financial statements in the period or periods in which that determination is made.  we earn a significant amount of our operating income outside the u.s. a change in the mix of earnings and losses in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in our business or structure, or the expiration of or disputes about certain tax agreements in a particular country may result in higher effective tax rates for the company. in addition, changes in u.s. federal and state or international tax laws applicable to corporate multinationals, other fundamental law changes currently being considered by many countries, including in the u.s., and changes in taxing jurisdictions\u2019 administrative interpretations, decisions, policies, and positions may materially adversely impact our consolidated financial statements.  intellectual property risks we may not be able to protect our source code from copying if there is an unauthorized disclosure.\u00a0source code, the detailed program commands for our operating systems and other software programs, is critical to our business. although we license portions of our application and operating system source code to several licensees, we take significant measures to protect the secrecy of large portions of our source code. if our source code leaks, we might lose future trade secret protection for that code. it may then become easier for third parties to compete with our products by copying functionality, which could adversely affect our revenue and operating margins. unauthorized disclosure of source code also could increase the security risks described elsewhere in these risk factors. legal changes, our evolving business model, piracy, and other factors may decrease the value of our intellectual property. protecting our intellectual property rights and combating unlicensed copying and use of our software and other intellectual property on a global basis is difficult. while piracy adversely affects u.s. revenue, the impact on revenue from outside the u.s. is more significant, particularly countries in which the legal system provides less protection for intellectual property rights. our revenue in these markets may grow more slowly than the underlying device market. similarly, the absence of harmonized patent laws makes it more difficult to ensure consistent respect for patent rights. throughout the world, we educate users about the benefits of licensing genuine products and obtaining indemnification benefits for intellectual property risks, and we educate lawmakers about the advantages of a business climate where intellectual property rights are protected. reductions in the legal protection for software intellectual property rights could adversely affect revenue.  we expend significant resources to patent the intellectual property we create with the expectation that we will generate revenues by incorporating that intellectual property in our products or services or, in some instances, by licensing or cross-licensing our patents to others in return for a royalty and/or increased freedom to operate.\u00a0changes in the law may continue to weaken our ability to prevent the use of patented technology or collect revenue for licensing our patents.\u00a0these include legislative changes and regulatory actions that make it more difficult to obtain injunctions, and the increasing use of legal process to challenge issued patents. similarly, licensees of our patents may fail to satisfy their obligations to pay us royalties or may contest the scope and extent of their obligations. the royalties we can obtain to monetize our intellectual property may decline because of the evolution of technology, price changes in products using licensed patents, greater value from cross-licensing, or the difficulty of discovering infringements. finally, our increasing engagement with open source software will also cause us to license our intellectual property rights broadly in certain situations and may negatively impact revenue. 32part i item 1a \u00a0 third parties may claim we infringe their intellectual property rights.\u00a0from time to time, others claim we infringe their intellectual property rights. the number of these claims may grow because of constant technological change in the markets in which we compete, the extensive patent coverage of existing technologies, the rapid rate of issuance of new patents, and our offering of first-party devices, such as surface. to resolve these claims, we may enter into royalty and licensing agreements on terms that are less favorable than currently available, stop selling or redesign affected products or services, or pay damages to satisfy indemnification commitments with our customers. these outcomes may cause operating margins to decline. besides money damages, in some jurisdictions plaintiffs can seek injunctive relief that may limit or prevent importing, marketing, and selling our products or services that have infringing technologies. in some countries, such as germany, an injunction can be issued before the parties have fully litigated the validity of the underlying patents. we have paid significant amounts to settle claims related to the use of technology and intellectual property rights and to procure intellectual property rights as part of our strategy to manage this risk, and may continue to do so.  general risks if our reputation or our brands are damaged, our business and operating results may be harmed. our reputation and brands are globally recognized and are important to our business. our reputation and brands affect our ability to attract and retain consumer, business, and public-sector customers. there are numerous ways our reputation or brands could be damaged. these include product safety or quality issues, or our environmental impact and sustainability, supply chain practices, or human rights record. we may experience backlash from customers, government entities, advocacy groups, employees, and other stakeholders that disagree with our product offering decisions or public policy positions. damage to our reputation or our brands may occur from, among other things:        the proliferation of social media may increase the likelihood, speed, and magnitude of negative brand events. if our brands or reputation are damaged, it could negatively impact our revenues or margins, or ability to attract the most highly qualified employees. adverse economic or market conditions may harm our business.\u00a0worsening economic conditions, including inflation, recession, pandemic, or other changes in economic conditions, may cause lower it spending and adversely affect our revenue. if demand for pcs, servers, and other computing devices declines, or consumer or business spending for those products declines, our revenue will be adversely affected.  our product distribution system relies on an extensive partner and retail network. oems building devices that run our software have also been a significant means of distribution. the impact of economic conditions on our partners, such as the bankruptcy of a major distributor, oem, or retailer, could cause sales channel disruption.  challenging economic conditions also may impair the ability of our customers to pay for products and services they have purchased. as a result, allowances for doubtful accounts and write-offs of accounts receivable may increase.  we maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings, types, and maturities. these investments are subject to general credit, liquidity, market, and interest rate risks, which may be exacerbated by market downturns or events that affect global financial markets. a significant part of our investment portfolio comprises u.s. government securities. if global financial markets decline for long periods, or if there is a downgrade of the u.s. government credit rating due to an actual or threatened default on government debt, our investment portfolio may be adversely affected and we could determine that more of our investments have experienced a decline in fair value, requiring impairment charges that could adversely affect our consolidated financial statements. 33part i item 1a \u00a0 catastrophic events or geopolitical conditions may disrupt our business.\u00a0a disruption or failure of our systems or operations because of a major earthquake, weather event, cyberattack, terrorist attack, pandemic, or other catastrophic event could cause delays in completing sales, providing services, or performing other critical functions. our corporate headquarters, a significant portion of our research and development activities, and certain other essential business operations are in the seattle, washington area, and we have other business operations in the silicon valley area of california, both of which are seismically active regions. a catastrophic event that results in the destruction or disruption of any of our critical business or it systems, or the infrastructure or systems they rely on, such as power grids, could harm our ability to conduct normal business operations. providing our customers with more services and solutions in the cloud puts a premium on the resilience of our systems and strength of our business continuity management plans and magnifies the potential impact of prolonged service outages in our consolidated financial statements.  abrupt political change, terrorist activity, and armed conflict pose a risk of general economic disruption in affected countries, which may increase our operating costs. these conditions also may add uncertainty to the timing and budget for technology investment decisions by our customers and may cause supply chain disruptions for hardware manufacturers. geopolitical change may result in changing regulatory systems and requirements and market interventions that could impact our operating strategies, access to national, regional, and global markets, hiring, and profitability. geopolitical instability may lead to sanctions and impact our ability to do business in some markets or with some public-sector customers. any of these changes may negatively impact our revenues.  the occurrence of regional epidemics or a global pandemic may adversely affect our operations, financial condition, and results of operations. the covid-19 pandemic continues to have widespread, rapidly evolving, and unpredictable impacts on global society, economies, financial markets, and business practices. federal and state governments have implemented measures to contain the virus, including social distancing, travel restrictions, and vaccination programs. even as efforts to contain the pandemic have made progress and some restrictions have relaxed, new variants of the virus are causing additional outbreaks. the covid-19 pandemic has impacted and may continue to impact our business operations, including our employees, customers, partners, and communities, and there is substantial uncertainty in the nature and degree of its continued effects over time. the extent to which the covid-19 pandemic impacts our business going forward will depend on numerous evolving factors we cannot reliably predict, including the duration and scope of the pandemic; governmental, business, and individuals' actions in response to the pandemic; and the impact on economic activity including the possibility of recession or financial market instability. these factors may adversely impact consumer, business, and government spending on technology as well as customers' ability to pay for our products and services on an ongoing basis. this uncertainty also affects management\u2019s accounting estimates and assumptions, which could result in greater variability in a variety of areas that depend on these estimates and assumptions, including investments, receivables, and forward-looking guidance. measures to contain the virus that impact us, our partners, distributors, and suppliers may further intensify these impacts and other risks described in these risk factors. any of these may adversely impact our ability to:             we may incur increased costs to effectively manage these aspects of our business. if we are unsuccessful it may adversely impact our revenues, cash flows, market share growth, and reputation. 34part i item 1a \u00a0 the long-term effects of climate change on the global economy and the it industry in particular are unclear. environmental regulations or changes in the supply, demand or available sources of energy or other resources may affect the availability or cost of goods and services, including natural resources, necessary to run our business. changes in climate where we operate may increase the costs of powering and cooling computer hardware we use to develop software and provide cloud-based services. our global business exposes us to operational and economic risks.\u00a0our customers are located throughout the world and a significant part of our revenue comes from international sales. the global nature of our business creates operational, economic, and geopolitical risks. our results of operations may be affected by global, regional, and local economic developments, monetary policy, inflation, and recession, as well as political and military disputes. in addition, our international growth strategy includes certain markets, the developing nature of which presents several risks, including deterioration of social, political, labor, or economic conditions in a country or region, and difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations. emerging nationalist and protectionist trends and concerns about human rights and political expression in specific countries may significantly alter the trade and commercial environments. changes to trade policy or agreements as a result of populism, protectionism, or economic nationalism may result in higher tariffs, local sourcing initiatives, and non-local sourcing restrictions, export controls, investment restrictions, or other developments that make it more difficult to sell our products in foreign countries. disruptions of these kinds in developed or emerging markets could negatively impact demand for our products and services or increase operating costs. although we hedge a portion of our international currency exposure, significant fluctuations in foreign exchange rates between the u.s. dollar and foreign currencies may adversely affect our results of operations.  our business depends on our ability to attract and retain talented employees.\u00a0our business is based on successfully attracting and retaining talented employees representing diverse backgrounds, experiences, and skill sets. the market for highly skilled workers and leaders in our industry is extremely competitive. maintaining our brand and reputation, as well as a diverse and inclusive work environment that enables all our employees to thrive, are important to our ability to recruit and retain employees. we are also limited in our ability to recruit internationally by restrictive domestic immigration laws. changes to u.s. immigration policies that restrain the flow of technical and professional talent may inhibit our ability to adequately staff our research and development efforts. if we are less successful in our recruiting efforts, or if we cannot retain highly skilled workers and key leaders, our ability to develop and deliver successful products and services may be adversely affected. effective succession planning is also important to our long-term success. failure to ensure effective transfer of knowledge and smooth transitions involving key employees could hinder our strategic planning and execution. how employment-related laws are interpreted and applied to our workforce practices may result in increased operating costs and less flexibility in how we meet our workforce needs.  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 35part ii item 7 \u00a0 industry trends  our industry is dynamic and highly competitive, with frequent changes in both technologies and business models. each industry shift is an opportunity to conceive new products, new technologies, or new ideas that can further transform the industry and our business. at microsoft, we push the boundaries of what is possible through a broad range of research and development activities that seek to identify and address the changing demands of customers and users, industry trends, and competitive forces. economic conditions, challenges, and risks the markets for software, devices, and cloud-based services are dynamic and highly competitive. our competitors are developing new software and devices, while also deploying competing cloud-based services for consumers and businesses. the devices and form factors customers prefer evolve rapidly, and influence how users access services in the cloud, and in some cases, the user\u2019s choice of which suite of cloud-based services to use. we must continue to evolve and adapt over an extended time in pace with this changing environment. the investments we are making in infrastructure and devices will continue to increase our operating costs and may decrease our operating margins. our success is highly dependent on our ability to attract and retain qualified employees. we hire a mix of university and industry talent worldwide. we compete for talented individuals globally by offering an exceptional working environment, broad customer reach, scale in resources, the ability to grow one\u2019s career across many different products and businesses, and competitive compensation and benefits. aggregate demand for our software, services, and devices is correlated to global macroeconomic and geopolitical factors, which remain dynamic. our devices are primarily manufactured by third-party contract manufacturers, some of which contain certain components for which there are very few qualified suppliers. for these components, we have limited near-term flexibility to use other manufacturers if a current vendor becomes unavailable or is unable to meet our requirements. extended disruptions at these suppliers could lead to a similar disruption in our ability to manufacture devices on time to meet consumer demand. our international operations provide a significant portion of our total revenue and expenses. many of these revenue and expenses are denominated in currencies other than the u.s. dollar. as a result, changes in foreign exchange rates may significantly affect revenue and expenses. weakening of the u.s. dollar relative to certain foreign currencies increased reported revenue and did not have a material impact on reported expenses from our international operations in fiscal year 2021. refer to risk factors (part i, item\u00a01a of this form 10-k) for a discussion of these factors and other risks. covid-19 in fiscal year 2021, the covid-19 pandemic continued to impact our business operations and financial results. cloud usage and demand benefited as customers accelerate their digital transformation priorities. our consumer businesses also benefited from the remote environment, with continued demand for pcs and productivity tools, as well as strong engagement across our gaming platform. we saw improvement in customer advertising spend and savings in operating expenses related to covid-19, but experienced weakness in transactional licensing. the covid-19 pandemic may continue to impact our business operations and financial operating results, and there is uncertainty in the nature and degree of its continued effects over time. refer to risk factors (part i, item\u00a01a of this form 10-k) for a discussion of these factors and other risks. seasonality our revenue fluctuates quarterly and is generally higher in the second and fourth quarters of our fiscal year. second quarter revenue is driven by corporate year-end spending trends in our major markets and holiday season spending by consumers, and fourth quarter revenue is driven by the volume of multi-year on-premises contracts executed during the period. 40part ii item 7 \u00a0 change in accounting estimate in july 2020, we completed an assessment of the useful lives of our server and network equipment and determined we should increase the estimated useful life of server equipment from three years to four years and increase the estimated useful life of network equipment from two years to four years. this change in accounting estimate was effective beginning fiscal year 2021. based on the carrying amount of server and network equipment included in property and equipment, net as of june 30, 2020, the effect of this change in estimate for fiscal year 2021 was an increase in operating income of $2.7 billion and net income of $2.3 billion, or $0.30 per both basic and diluted share.  reportable segments we report our financial performance based on the following segments: productivity and business processes, intelligent cloud, and more personal computing. the segment amounts included in md&a are presented on a basis consistent with our internal management reporting. all differences between our internal management reporting basis and accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america (\u201cgaap\u201d), along with certain corporate-level and other activity, are included in corporate and other. additional information on our reportable segments is contained in note 19 \u2013 segment information and geographic data of the notes to financial statements (part ii, item\u00a08 of this form 10-k).  metrics we use metrics in assessing the performance of our business and to make informed decisions regarding the allocation of resources. we disclose metrics to enable investors to evaluate progress against our ambitions, provide transparency into performance trends, and reflect the continued evolution of our products and services. our commercial and other business metrics are fundamentally connected based on how customers use our products and services. the metrics are disclosed in the md&a or the notes to financial statements (part ii, item\u00a08 of this form 10-k). financial metrics are calculated based on gaap results and growth comparisons relate to the corresponding period of last fiscal year. commercial our commercial business primarily consists of server products and cloud services, office commercial, windows commercial, the commercial portion of linkedin, enterprise services, and dynamics. our commercial metrics allow management and investors to assess the overall health of our commercial business and include leading indicators of future performance. \u00a0   \u00a0 41part ii item 7 \u00a0 productivity and business processes and intelligent cloud metrics related to our productivity and business processes and intelligent cloud segments assess the health of our core businesses within these segments. the metrics reflect our cloud and on-premises product strategies and trends. \u00a0   more personal computing metrics related to our more personal computing segment assess the performance of key lines of business within this segment. these metrics provide strategic product insights which allow us to assess the performance across our commercial and consumer businesses. as we have diversity of target audiences and sales motions within the windows business, we monitor metrics that are reflective of those varying motions. \u00a0   42part ii item 7 \u00a0   summary results of operations \u00a0   \u00a0 adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share (\u201ceps\u201d) are non-gaap financial measures which exclude tax benefits related to an india supreme court decision on withholding taxes in fiscal year 2021. refer to the non-gaap financial measures section below for a reconciliation of our financial results reported in accordance with gaap to non-gaap financial results. see note 12 \u2013 income taxes of the notes to financial statements (part ii, item 8 of this form 10-k) for further discussion. revenue increased $25.1 billion or 18% driven by growth across each of our segments. intelligent cloud revenue increased driven by azure. productivity and business processes revenue increased driven by office 365 commercial and linkedin. more personal computing revenue increased driven by gaming.  cost of revenue increased $6.2 billion or 13% driven by growth in commercial cloud and gaming, offset in part by a reduction in depreciation expense due to the change in estimated useful lives of our server and network equipment. gross margin increased $18.9 billion or 20% driven by growth across each of our segments and the change in estimated useful lives of our server and network equipment. gross margin percentage increased with the change in estimated useful lives of our server and network equipment. excluding this impact, gross margin percentage decreased slightly driven by gross margin percentage reduction in more personal computing. commercial cloud gross margin percentage increased 4 points to 71% driven by gross margin percentage improvement in azure and the change in estimated useful lives of our server and network equipment, offset in part by sales mix shift to azure. operating expenses increased $2.0 billion or 4% driven by investments in cloud engineering and commercial sales, offset in part by savings related to covid-19 across each of our segments, prior year charges associated with the closing of our microsoft store physical locations, and a reduction in bad debt expense. key changes in operating expenses were:       43part ii item 7 \u00a0 operating income increased $17.0 billion or 32% driven by growth across each of our segments and the change in estimated useful lives of our server and network equipment. current year net income and diluted eps were positively impacted by the tax benefit related to the india supreme court decision on withholding taxes, which resulted in an increase to net income and diluted eps of $620 million and $0.08, respectively. revenue, gross margin, and operating income included a favorable foreign currency impact of 3%, 3%, and 4%, respectively.  segment results of operations \u00a0   reportable segments  productivity and business processes  revenue increased $7.5 billion or 16%.          operating income increased $5.6 billion or 30%.     revenue, gross margin, and operating income included a favorable foreign currency impact of 2%, 3%, and 4%, respectively.  44part ii item 7 \u00a0 intelligent cloud  revenue increased $11.7 billion or 24%.      operating income increased $7.8 billion or 43%.      revenue, gross margin, and operating income included a favorable foreign currency impact of 2%, 3%, and 4%, respectively. more personal computing  revenue increased $5.8 billion or 12%.          operating income increased $3.5 billion or 22%.     gross margin and operating income included a favorable foreign currency impact of 2% and 3%, respectively. 45part ii item 7 \u00a0 operating expenses research and development \u00a0   \u00a0 research and development expenses include payroll, employee benefits, stock-based compensation expense, and other headcount-related expenses associated with product development. research and development expenses also include third-party development and programming costs, localization costs incurred to translate software for international markets, and the amortization of purchased software code and services content.  research and development expenses increased $1.4 billion or 8% driven by investments in cloud engineering. sales and marketing \u00a0   \u00a0 sales and marketing expenses include payroll, employee benefits, stock-based compensation expense, and other headcount-related expenses associated with sales and marketing personnel, and the costs of advertising, promotions, trade shows, seminars, and other programs.  sales and marketing expenses increased $519 million or 3% driven by investments in commercial sales, offset in part by a reduction in bad debt expense. sales and marketing included an unfavorable foreign currency impact of 2%. general and administrative \u00a0   \u00a0 general and administrative expenses include payroll, employee benefits, stock-based compensation expense, severance expense, and other headcount-related expenses associated with finance, legal, facilities, certain human resources and other administrative personnel, certain taxes, and legal and other administrative fees. general and administrative expenses were relatively unchanged, driven by prior year charges associated with the closing of our microsoft store physical locations, offset in part by an increase in certain employee-related expenses and business taxes. 46part ii item 7 \u00a0 other income (expense), net  the components of other income (expense), net were as follows:  \u00a0   we use derivative instruments to manage risks related to foreign currencies, equity prices, interest rates, and credit; enhance investment returns; and facilitate portfolio diversification. gains and losses from changes in fair values of derivatives that are not designated as hedging instruments are primarily recognized in other income (expense), net.  interest and dividends income decreased due to lower yields on fixed-income securities. interest expense decreased due to a decrease in outstanding long-term debt due to debt maturities. net recognized gains on investments increased due to higher gains on equity securities. net gains on derivatives decreased due to lower gains on foreign currency contracts. income taxes  effective tax rate our effective tax rate for fiscal years 2021 and 2020 was 14% and 17%, respectively.\u00a0the decrease in our effective tax rate was primarily due to tax benefits from a decision by the india supreme court on withholding taxes in the case of engineering analysis centre of excellence private limited vs the commissioner of income tax, an agreement between the u.s. and india tax authorities related to transfer pricing, final tax cuts and jobs act (\u201ctcja\u201d) regulations, and an increase in tax benefits relating to stock-based compensation. we have historically paid india withholding taxes on software sales through distributor withholding and tax audit assessments in india. in march 2021, the india supreme court ruled favorably for companies in 86 separate appeals, some dating back to 2012,  holding that software sales are not subject to india withholding taxes. although we were not a party to the appeals, our software sales in india were determined to be not subject to withholding taxes. therefore, we recorded a net income tax benefit of $620 million in the third quarter of fiscal year 2021 to reflect the results of the india supreme court decision impacting fiscal year 1996 through fiscal year 2016. our effective tax rate was lower than the u.s. federal statutory rate, primarily due to earnings taxed at lower rates in foreign jurisdictions resulting from producing and distributing our products and services through our foreign regional operations centers in ireland and puerto rico, tax benefits relating to stock-based compensation, and tax benefits from the india supreme court decision on withholding taxes.  the mix of income before income taxes between the u.s. and foreign countries impacted our effective tax rate as a result of the geographic distribution of, and customer demand for, our products and services. in fiscal year 2021, our u.s. income before income taxes was $35.0 billion and our foreign income before income taxes was $36.1 billion. in fiscal year 2020, our u.s. income before income taxes was $24.1 billion and our foreign income before income taxes was $28.9 billion. uncertain tax positions we settled a portion of the internal revenue service (\u201cirs\u201d) audit for tax years 2004 to 2006 in fiscal year 2011. in february 2012, the irs withdrew its 2011 revenue agents report related to unresolved issues for tax years 2004 to 2006 and reopened the audit phase of the examination. we also settled a portion of the irs audit for tax years 2007 to 2009 in fiscal year 2016, and a portion of the irs audit for tax years 2010 to 2013 in fiscal year 2018. in the second quarter of fiscal year 2021, we settled an additional portion of the irs audits for tax years 2004 to 2013 and made a payment of $1.7 billion, including tax and interest. we remain under audit for tax years 2004 to 2017.  47part ii item 7 \u00a0 as of june 30, 2021, the primary unresolved issues for the irs audits relate to transfer pricing, which could have a material impact in our consolidated financial statements when the matters are resolved. we believe our allowances for income tax contingencies are adequate. we have not received a proposed assessment for the unresolved key transfer pricing issues and do not expect a final resolution of these issues in the next 12 months.\u00a0based on the information currently available, we do not anticipate a significant increase or decrease to our tax contingencies for these issues within the next 12 months. we are subject to income tax in many jurisdictions outside the u.s. our operations in certain jurisdictions remain subject to examination for tax years 1996 to 2020, some of which are currently under audit by local tax authorities. the resolution of each of these audits is not expected to be material to our consolidated financial statements. non-gaap financial measures adjusted net income and adjusted diluted eps are non-gaap financial measures which exclude the tax benefits related to the india supreme court decision on withholding taxes in fiscal year 2021. we believe these non-gaap measures aid investors by providing additional insight into our operational performance and help clarify trends affecting our business. for comparability of reporting, management considers non-gaap measures in conjunction with gaap financial results in evaluating business performance. these non-gaap financial measures presented should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, the measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with gaap. the following table reconciles our financial results reported in accordance with gaap to non-gaap financial results: \u00a0   \u00a0   48part ii item 7 \u00a0 financial condition cash, cash equivalents, and investments  cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments totaled $130.3 billion and $136.5 billion as of june 30, 2021 and 2020. equity investments were $6.0 billion and $3.0 billion as of june 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively. our short-term investments are primarily intended to facilitate liquidity and capital preservation. they consist predominantly of highly liquid investment-grade fixed-income securities, diversified among industries and individual issuers. the investments are predominantly u.s. dollar-denominated securities, but also include foreign currency-denominated securities to diversify risk. our fixed-income investments are exposed to interest rate risk and credit risk. the credit risk and average maturity of our fixed-income portfolio are managed to achieve economic returns that correlate to certain fixed-income indices. the settlement risk related to these investments is insignificant given that the short-term investments held are primarily highly liquid investment-grade fixed-income securities.  valuation  in general, and where applicable, we use quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities to determine the fair value of our financial instruments. this pricing methodology applies to our level 1 investments, such as u.s. government securities, common and preferred stock, and mutual funds. if quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities are not available to determine fair value, then we use quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities or inputs other than the quoted prices that are observable either directly or indirectly. this pricing methodology applies to our level 2 investments, such as commercial paper, certificates of deposit, u.s. agency securities, foreign government bonds, mortgage- and asset-backed securities, corporate notes and bonds, and municipal securities. level 3 investments are valued using internally-developed models with unobservable inputs. assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis using unobservable inputs are an immaterial portion of our portfolio.  a majority of our investments are priced by pricing vendors and are generally level 1 or level 2 investments as these vendors either provide a quoted market price in an active market or use observable inputs for their pricing without applying significant adjustments. broker pricing is used mainly when a quoted price is not available, the investment is not priced by our pricing vendors, or when a broker price is more reflective of fair values in the market in which the investment trades. our broker-priced investments are generally classified as level 2 investments because the broker prices these investments based on similar assets without applying significant adjustments. in addition, all our broker-priced investments have a sufficient level of trading volume to demonstrate that the fair values used are appropriate for these investments. our fair value processes include controls that are designed to ensure appropriate fair values are recorded. these controls include model validation, review of key model inputs, analysis of period-over-period fluctuations, and independent recalculation of prices where appropriate.  cash flows  cash from operations increased $16.1 billion to $76.7 billion for fiscal year 2021, mainly due to an increase in cash received from customers, offset in part by an increase in cash paid to suppliers and employees. cash used in financing increased $2.5 billion to $48.5 billion for fiscal year 2021, mainly due to a $4.4 billion increase in common stock repurchases and a $1.4 billion increase in dividends paid, offset in part by a $1.8 billion decrease in repayments of debt and a $1.7 billion decrease in cash premium paid on debt exchange. cash used in investing increased $15.4 billion to $27.6 billion for fiscal year 2021, mainly due to a $6.4 billion increase in cash used for acquisitions of companies, net of cash acquired, and purchases of intangible and other assets, a $5.2 billion increase in additions to property and equipment, and a $4.1 billion decrease in cash from net investment purchases, sales, and maturities. debt  we issue debt to take advantage of favorable pricing and liquidity in the debt markets, reflecting our credit rating and the low interest rate environment. the proceeds of these issuances were or will be used for general corporate purposes, which may include, among other things, funding for working capital, capital expenditures, repurchases of capital stock, acquisitions, and repayment of existing debt. in march 2021 and june 2020, we exchanged a portion of our existing debt at a premium for cash and new debt with longer maturities to take advantage of favorable financing rates in the debt markets, reflecting our credit rating and the low interest rate environment. refer to note 11 \u2013 debt of the notes to financial statements (part ii, item\u00a08 of this form 10-k) for further discussion. 49part ii item 7 \u00a0 unearned revenue  unearned revenue comprises mainly unearned revenue related to volume licensing programs, which may include software assurance (\u201csa\u201d) and cloud services. unearned revenue is generally invoiced annually at the beginning of each contract period for multi-year agreements and recognized ratably over the coverage period. unearned revenue also includes payments for other offerings for which we have been paid in advance and earn the revenue when we transfer control of the product or service. refer to note 1 \u2013 accounting policies of the notes to financial statements (part ii, item 8 of this form 10-k) for further discussion. the following table outlines the expected future recognition of unearned revenue as of june 30, 2021: \u00a0   if our customers choose to license cloud-based versions of our products and services rather than licensing transaction-based products and services, the associated revenue will shift from being recognized at the time of the transaction to being recognized over the subscription period or upon consumption, as applicable.  share repurchases  during fiscal years 2021 and 2020, we repurchased 101 million shares and 126 million shares of our common stock for $23.0 billion and $19.7 billion, respectively, through our share repurchase programs. all repurchases were made using cash resources. refer to note 16 \u2013 stockholders\u2019 equity of the notes to financial statements (part ii, item\u00a08 of this form 10-k) for further discussion. dividends  refer to note 16 \u2013 stockholders\u2019 equity of the notes to financial statements (part ii, item\u00a08 of this form 10-k) for further discussion. off-balance sheet arrangements  we provide indemnifications of varying scope and size to certain customers against claims of intellectual property infringement made by third parties arising from the use of our products and certain other matters. additionally, we have agreed to cover damages resulting from breaches of certain security and privacy commitments in our cloud business. in evaluating estimated losses on these obligations, we consider factors such as the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and our ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss. these obligations did not have a material impact in our consolidated financial statements during the periods presented.  50part ii item 7 \u00a0 contractual obligations  the following table summarizes the payments due by fiscal year for our outstanding contractual obligations as of june 30, 2021:  \u00a0   \u00a0             other planned uses of capital  on april\u00a011, 2021, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire nuance communications, inc. (\u201cnuance\u201d) for $56.00 per share in an\u00a0all-cash\u00a0transaction valued at $19.7 billion, inclusive of nuance\u2019s net debt.\u00a0the acquisition has been approved by nuance\u2019s shareholders, and we expect it to close by the end of calendar year 2021, subject to the satisfaction of certain regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions. we will continue to invest in sales, marketing, product support infrastructure, and existing and advanced areas of technology, as well as continue making acquisitions that align with our business strategy. additions to property and equipment will continue, including new facilities, datacenters, and computer systems for research and development, sales and marketing, support, and administrative staff. we expect capital expenditures to increase in coming years to support growth in our cloud offerings. we have operating and finance leases for datacenters, corporate offices, research and development facilities, microsoft experience centers, and certain equipment. we have not engaged in any related party transactions or arrangements with unconsolidated entities or other persons that are reasonably likely to materially affect liquidity or the availability of capital resources.  liquidity as a result of the tcja, we are required to pay a one-time transition tax on deferred foreign income not previously subject to u.s. income tax. under the tcja, the transition tax is payable in interest-free installments over eight years, with 8% due in each of the first five years, 15% in year six, 20% in year seven, and 25% in year eight. we have paid transition tax of $4.7 billion, which included $1.5 billion for fiscal year 2021. the remaining transition tax of $13.6 billion is payable over the next five years with a final payment in fiscal year 2026.  we expect existing cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, cash flows from operations, and access to capital markets to continue to be sufficient to fund our operating activities and cash commitments for investing and financing activities, such as dividends, share repurchases, debt maturities, material capital expenditures, and the transition tax related to the tcja, for at least the next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future.  51part ii item 7 \u00a0 recent accounting guidance  refer to note 1 \u2013 accounting policies of the notes to financial statements (part ii, item\u00a08 of this form 10-k) for further discussion. application of critical accounting policies  our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with gaap. preparing consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. these estimates and assumptions are affected by management\u2019s application of accounting policies, as well as uncertainty in the current economic environment due to covid-19. critical accounting policies for us include revenue recognition, impairment of investment securities, goodwill, research and development costs, contingencies, income taxes, and inventories.  revenue recognition  our contracts with customers often include promises to transfer multiple products and services to a customer. determining whether products and services are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately versus together may require significant judgment. when a cloud-based service includes both on-premises software licenses and cloud services, judgment is required to determine whether the software license is considered distinct and accounted for separately, or not distinct and accounted for together with the cloud service and recognized over time. certain cloud services, primarily office 365, depend on a significant level of integration, interdependency, and interrelation between the desktop applications and cloud services, and are accounted for together as one performance obligation. revenue from office 365 is recognized ratably over the period in which the cloud services are provided.  judgment is required to determine the stand-alone selling price (\u201cssp\") for each distinct performance obligation. we use a single amount to estimate ssp for items that are not sold separately, including on-premises licenses sold with sa or software updates provided at no additional charge. we use a range of amounts to estimate ssp when we sell each of the products and services separately and need to determine whether there is a discount to be allocated based on the relative ssp of the various products and services.  in instances where ssp is not directly observable, such as when we do not sell the product or service separately, we determine the ssp using information that may include market conditions and other observable inputs. we typically have more than one ssp for individual products and services due to the stratification of those products and services by customers and circumstances. in these instances, we may use information such as the size of the customer and geographic region in determining the ssp.  due to the various benefits from and the nature of our sa program, judgment is required to assess the pattern of delivery, including the exercise pattern of certain benefits across our portfolio of customers.  our products are generally sold with a right of return, we may provide other credits or incentives, and in certain instances we estimate customer usage of our products and services, which are accounted for as variable consideration when determining the amount of revenue to recognize. returns and credits are estimated at contract inception and updated at the end of each reporting period if additional information becomes available. changes to our estimated variable consideration were not material for the periods presented.  impairment of investment securities  we review debt investments quarterly for credit losses and impairment. if the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value, we evaluate, among other factors, general market conditions, credit quality of debt instrument issuers, and the extent to which the fair value is less than cost. this determination requires significant judgment. in making this judgment, we employ a systematic methodology that considers available quantitative and qualitative evidence in evaluating potential impairment of our investments. in addition, we consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of, and business outlook for, the investee. if we have plans to sell the security or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery, then a decline in fair value below cost is recorded as an impairment charge in other income (expense), net and a new cost basis in the investment is established. if market, industry, and/or investee conditions deteriorate, we may incur future impairments.  52part ii item 7 \u00a0 equity investments without readily determinable fair values are written down to fair value if a qualitative assessment indicates that the investment is impaired and the fair value of the investment is less than carrying value. we perform a qualitative assessment on a periodic basis. we are required to estimate the fair value of the investment to determine the amount of the impairment loss. once an investment is determined to be impaired, an impairment charge is recorded in other income (expense), net.  goodwill  we allocate goodwill to reporting units based on the reporting unit expected to benefit from the business combination. we evaluate our reporting units on an annual basis and, if necessary, reassign goodwill using a relative fair value allocation approach. goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level (operating segment or one level below an operating segment) on an annual basis (may 1 for us) and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. these events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate, legal factors, operating performance indicators, competition, or sale or disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit.  application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment, including the identification of reporting units, assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units, assignment of goodwill to reporting units, and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit. the fair value of each reporting unit is estimated primarily through the use of a discounted cash flow methodology. this analysis requires significant judgments, including estimation of future cash flows, which is dependent on internal forecasts, estimation of the long-term rate of growth for our business, estimation of the useful life over which cash flows will occur, and determination of our weighted average cost of capital.  the estimates used to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit change from year to year based on operating results, market conditions, and other factors. changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and goodwill impairment for each reporting unit.  research and development costs  costs incurred internally in researching and developing a computer software product are charged to expense until technological feasibility has been established for the product. once technological feasibility is established, software costs are capitalized until the product is available for general release to customers. judgment is required in determining when technological feasibility of a product is established. we have determined that technological feasibility for our software products is reached after all high-risk development issues have been resolved through coding and testing. generally, this occurs shortly before the products are released to production. the amortization of these costs is included in cost of revenue over the estimated life of the products.  legal and other contingencies  the outcomes of legal proceedings and claims brought against us are subject to significant uncertainty. an estimated loss from a loss contingency such as a legal proceeding or claim is accrued by a charge to income if it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. in determining whether a loss should be accrued we evaluate, among other factors, the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss. changes in these factors could materially impact our consolidated financial statements. income taxes  the objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year, and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entity\u2019s financial statements or tax returns. we recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. accounting literature also provides guidance on derecognition of income tax assets and liabilities, classification of deferred income tax assets and liabilities, accounting for interest and penalties associated with tax positions, and income tax disclosures. judgment is required in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements or tax returns. variations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could materially impact our consolidated financial statements.  53part ii item 7 \u00a0 the tcja significantly changes existing u.s. tax law and includes numerous provisions that affect our business. refer to note 12 \u2013 income taxes of the notes to financial statements (part ii, item 8 of this form 10-k) for further discussion. inventories  inventories are stated at average cost, subject to the lower of cost or net realizable value. cost includes materials, labor, and manufacturing overhead related to the purchase and production of inventories. net realizable value is the estimated selling price less estimated costs of completion, disposal, and transportation. we regularly review inventory quantities on hand, future purchase commitments with our suppliers, and the estimated utility of our inventory. these reviews include analysis of demand forecasts, product life cycle status, product development plans, current sales levels, pricing strategy, and component cost trends. if our review indicates a reduction in utility below carrying value, we reduce our inventory to a new cost basis through a charge to cost of revenue. \u00a0 54part ii item 7 \u00a0 statement of management\u2019s responsibility for financial statements  management is responsible for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements and related information that are presented in this report. the consolidated financial statements, which include amounts based on management\u2019s estimates and judgments, have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america.  the company designs and maintains accounting and internal control systems to provide reasonable assurance at reasonable cost that assets are safeguarded against loss from unauthorized use or disposition, and that the financial records are reliable for preparing consolidated financial statements and maintaining accountability for assets. these systems are augmented by written policies, an organizational structure providing division of responsibilities, careful selection and training of qualified personnel, and a program of internal audits.  the company engaged deloitte\u00a0& touche llp, an independent registered public accounting firm, to audit and render an opinion on the consolidated financial statements and internal control over financial reporting in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board (united states).  the board of directors, through its audit committee, consisting solely of independent directors of the company, meets periodically with management, internal auditors, and our independent registered public accounting firm to ensure that each is meeting its responsibilities and to discuss matters concerning internal controls and financial reporting. deloitte\u00a0& touche llp and the internal auditors each have full and free access to the audit committee.  \u00a0   \u00a0 55part ii item 7a \u00a0 item\u00a07a.\u00a0quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk risks  we are exposed to economic risk from foreign exchange rates, interest rates, credit risk, and equity prices. we use derivatives instruments to manage these risks, however, they may still impact our consolidated financial statements.  foreign currencies  certain forecasted transactions, assets, and liabilities are exposed to foreign currency risk. we monitor our foreign currency exposures daily to maximize the economic effectiveness of our foreign currency positions, including hedges. principal currency exposures include the euro, japanese yen, british pound, canadian dollar, and australian dollar.  interest rate  securities held in our fixed-income portfolio are subject to different interest rate risks based on their maturities. we manage the average maturity of the fixed-income portfolio to achieve economic returns that correlate to certain global fixed-income indices.  credit our fixed-income portfolio is diversified and consists primarily of investment-grade securities. we manage credit exposures relative to broad-based indices and to facilitate portfolio diversification.  equity  securities held in our equity investments portfolio are subject to price risk.  sensitivity analysis the following table sets forth the potential loss in future earnings or fair values, including associated derivatives, resulting from hypothetical changes in relevant market rates or prices:  \u00a0   \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 56part ii item 8 \u00a0 notes to financial statements  note 1 \u2014 accounting policies accounting principles  our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america (\u201cgaap\u201d). we have recast certain prior period amounts to conform to the current period presentation. the recast of these prior period amounts had no impact on our consolidated balance sheets, consolidated income statements, or consolidated cash flows statements.  principles of consolidation  the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of microsoft corporation and its subsidiaries. intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated.  estimates and assumptions  preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. examples of estimates and assumptions include: for revenue recognition, determining the nature and timing of satisfaction of performance obligations, and determining the standalone selling price (\u201cssp\u201d) of performance obligations, variable consideration, and other obligations such as product returns and refunds; loss contingencies; product warranties; the fair value of and/or potential impairment of goodwill and intangible assets for our reporting units; product life cycles; useful lives of our tangible and intangible assets; allowances for doubtful accounts; the market value of, and demand for, our inventory; stock-based compensation forfeiture rates; when technological feasibility is achieved for our products; the potential outcome of uncertain tax positions that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements or tax returns; and determining the timing and amount of impairments for investments. actual results and outcomes may differ from management\u2019s estimates and assumptions due to risks and uncertainties, including uncertainty in the current economic environment due to covid-19. in july 2020, we completed an assessment of the useful lives of our server and network equipment and determined we should increase the estimated useful life of server equipment from three years to four years and increase the estimated useful life of network equipment from two years to four years. this change in accounting estimate was effective beginning fiscal year 2021. based on the carrying amount of server and network equipment included in property and equipment, net as of june 30, 2020, the effect of this change in estimate for fiscal year 2021 was an increase in operating income of $2.7 billion and net income of $2.3 billion, or $0.30 per both basic and diluted share.  foreign currencies  assets and liabilities recorded in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rate on the balance sheet date. revenue and expenses are translated at average rates of exchange prevailing during the year. translation adjustments resulting from this process are recorded to other comprehensive income.  revenue\u00a0\u00a0 product revenue and service and other revenue  product revenue includes sales from operating systems, cross-device productivity applications, server applications, business solution applications, desktop and server management tools, software development tools, video games, and hardware such as pcs, tablets, gaming and entertainment consoles, other intelligent devices, and related accessories.  service and other revenue includes sales from cloud-based solutions that provide customers with software, services, platforms, and content such as office 365, azure, dynamics 365, and xbox; solution support; and consulting services. service and other revenue also includes sales from online advertising and linkedin. 62part ii item 8 \u00a0 revenue recognition revenue is recognized upon transfer of control of promised products or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those products or services. we enter into contracts that can include various combinations of products and services, which are generally capable of being distinct and accounted for as separate performance obligations. revenue is recognized net of allowances for returns and any taxes collected from customers, which are subsequently remitted to governmental authorities.  nature of products and services licenses for on-premises software provide the customer with a right to use the software as it exists when made available to the customer. customers may purchase perpetual licenses or subscribe to licenses, which provide customers with the same functionality and differ mainly in the duration over which the customer benefits from the software. revenue from distinct on-premises licenses is recognized upfront at the point in time when the software is made available to the customer. in cases where we allocate revenue to software updates, primarily because the updates are provided at no additional charge, revenue is recognized as the updates are provided, which is generally ratably over the estimated life of the related device or license. certain volume licensing programs, including enterprise agreements, include on-premises licenses combined with software assurance (\u201csa\u201d). sa conveys rights to new software and upgrades released over the contract period and provides support, tools, and training to help customers deploy and use products more efficiently. on-premises licenses are considered distinct performance obligations when sold with sa. revenue allocated to sa is generally recognized ratably over the contract period as customers simultaneously consume and receive benefits, given that sa comprises distinct performance obligations that are satisfied over time.  cloud services, which allow customers to use hosted software over the contract period without taking possession of the software, are provided on either a subscription or consumption basis. revenue related to cloud services provided on a subscription basis is recognized ratably over the contract period. revenue related to cloud services provided on a consumption basis, such as the amount of storage used in a period, is recognized based on the customer utilization of such resources. when cloud services require a significant level of integration and interdependency with software and the individual components are not considered distinct, all revenue is recognized over the period in which the cloud services are provided.  revenue from search advertising is recognized when the advertisement appears in the search results or when the action necessary to earn the revenue has been completed. revenue from consulting services is recognized as services are provided.  our hardware is generally highly dependent on, and interrelated with, the underlying operating system and cannot function without the operating system. in these cases, the hardware and software license are accounted for as a single performance obligation and revenue is recognized at the point in time when ownership is transferred to resellers or directly to end customers through retail stores and online marketplaces.  refer to note 19 \u2013 segment information and geographic data for further information, including revenue by significant product and service offering. significant judgments our contracts with customers often include promises to transfer multiple products and services to a customer. determining whether products and services are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately versus together may require significant judgment. when a cloud-based service includes both on-premises software licenses and cloud services, judgment is required to determine whether the software license is considered distinct and accounted for separately, or not distinct and accounted for together with the cloud service and recognized over time. certain cloud services, primarily office 365, depend on a significant level of integration, interdependency, and interrelation between the desktop applications and cloud services, and are accounted for together as one performance obligation. revenue from office 365 is recognized ratably over the period in which the cloud services are provided. 63part ii item 8 \u00a0 judgment is required to determine the ssp for each distinct performance obligation. we use a single amount to estimate ssp for items that are not sold separately, including on-premises licenses sold with sa or software updates provided at no additional charge. we use a range of amounts to estimate ssp when we sell each of the products and services separately and need to determine whether there is a discount to be allocated based on the relative ssp of the various products and services.  in instances where ssp is not directly observable, such as when we do not sell the product or service separately, we determine the ssp using information that may include market conditions and other observable inputs. we typically have more than one ssp for individual products and services due to the stratification of those products and services by customers and circumstances. in these instances, we may use information such as the size of the customer and geographic region in determining the ssp.  due to the various benefits from and the nature of our sa program, judgment is required to assess the pattern of delivery, including the exercise pattern of certain benefits across our portfolio of customers.  our products are generally sold with a right of return, we may provide other credits or incentives, and in certain instances we estimate customer usage of our products and services, which are accounted for as variable consideration when determining the amount of revenue to recognize. returns and credits are estimated at contract inception and updated at the end of each reporting period if additional information becomes available. changes to our estimated variable consideration were not material for the periods presented. contract balances and other receivables  timing of revenue recognition may differ from the timing of invoicing to customers. we record a receivable when revenue is recognized prior to invoicing, or unearned revenue when revenue is recognized subsequent to invoicing. for multi-year agreements, we generally invoice customers annually at the beginning of each annual coverage period. we record a receivable related to revenue recognized for multi-year on-premises licenses as we have an unconditional right to invoice and receive payment in the future related to those licenses.  unearned revenue comprises mainly unearned revenue related to volume licensing programs, which may include sa and cloud services. unearned revenue is generally invoiced annually at the beginning of each contract period for multi-year agreements and recognized ratably over the coverage period. unearned revenue also includes payments for consulting services to be performed in the future, linkedin subscriptions, office 365 subscriptions, xbox subscriptions, windows 10 post-delivery support, dynamics business solutions, and other offerings for which we have been paid in advance and earn the revenue when we transfer control of the product or service.  refer to note 13 \u2013 unearned revenue for further information, including unearned revenue by segment and changes in unearned revenue during the period. payment terms and conditions vary by contract type, although terms generally include a requirement of payment within 30 to 60 days. in instances where the timing of revenue recognition differs from the timing of invoicing, we have determined our contracts generally do not include a significant financing component. the primary purpose of our invoicing terms is to provide customers with simplified and predictable ways of purchasing our products and services, not to receive financing from our customers or to provide customers with financing. examples include invoicing at the beginning of a subscription term with revenue recognized ratably over the contract period, and multi-year on-premises licenses that are invoiced annually with revenue recognized upfront. as of june 30, 2021 and 2020, other receivables due from suppliers were $965 million and $442 million, respectively, and are included in accounts receivable, net in our consolidated balance sheets. as of june 30, 2021 and 2020, long-term accounts receivable, net of allowance for doubtful accounts, was $3.4 billion and $2.7 billion, respectively, and is included in other long-term assets in our consolidated balance sheets. the allowance for doubtful accounts reflects our best estimate of probable losses inherent in the accounts receivable balance. we determine the allowance based on known troubled accounts, historical experience, and other currently available evidence.  64part ii item 8 \u00a0 activity in the allowance for doubtful accounts was as follows:\u00a0 \u00a0   \u00a0 allowance for doubtful accounts included in our consolidated balance sheets: \u00a0   \u00a0 we record financing receivables when we offer certain of our customers the option to acquire our software products and services offerings through a financing program in a limited number of countries. as of june 30, 2021 and 2020, our financing receivables, net were $4.4 billion and $5.2 billion, respectively, for short-term and long-term financing receivables, which are included in other current assets and other long-term assets in our consolidated balance sheets. we record an allowance to cover expected losses based on troubled accounts, historical experience, and other currently available evidence. assets recognized from costs to obtain a contract with a customer we recognize an asset for the incremental costs of obtaining a contract with a customer if we expect the benefit of those costs to be longer than one year. we have determined that certain sales incentive programs meet the requirements to be capitalized. total capitalized costs to obtain a contract were immaterial during the periods presented and are included in other current and long-term assets in our consolidated balance sheets.  we apply a practical expedient to expense costs as incurred for costs to obtain a contract with a customer when the amortization period would have been one year or less. these costs include our internal sales force compensation program and certain partner sales incentive programs as we have determined annual compensation is commensurate with annual sales activities. cost of revenue  cost of revenue includes: manufacturing and distribution costs for products sold and programs licensed; operating costs related to product support service centers and product distribution centers; costs incurred to include software on pcs sold by original equipment manufacturers (\u201coem\u201d), to drive traffic to our websites, and to acquire online advertising space; costs incurred to support and maintain online products and services, including datacenter costs and royalties; warranty costs; inventory valuation adjustments; costs associated with the delivery of consulting services; and the amortization of capitalized software development costs. capitalized software development costs are amortized over the estimated lives of the products.  product warranty  we provide for the estimated costs of fulfilling our obligations under hardware and software warranties at the time the related revenue is recognized. for hardware warranties, we estimate the costs based on historical and projected product failure rates, historical and projected repair costs, and knowledge of specific product failures (if any). the specific hardware warranty terms and conditions vary depending upon the product sold and the country in which we do business, but generally include parts and labor over a period generally ranging from 90\u00a0days to three years. for software warranties, we estimate the costs to provide bug fixes, such as security patches, over the estimated life of the software. we regularly reevaluate our estimates to assess the adequacy of the recorded warranty liabilities and adjust the amounts as necessary.  65part ii item 8 \u00a0 research and development  research and development expenses include payroll, employee benefits, stock-based compensation expense, and other headcount-related expenses associated with product development. research and development expenses also include third-party development and programming costs, localization costs incurred to translate software for international markets, and the amortization of purchased software code and services content. such costs related to software development are included in research and development expense until the point that technological feasibility is reached, which for our software products, is generally shortly before the products are released to production. once technological feasibility is reached, such costs are capitalized and amortized to cost of revenue over the estimated lives of the products.  sales and marketing  sales and marketing expenses include payroll, employee benefits, stock-based compensation expense, and other headcount-related expenses associated with sales and marketing personnel, and the costs of advertising, promotions, trade shows, seminars, and other programs. advertising costs are expensed as incurred. advertising expense was $1.5 billion, $1.6 billion, and $1.6 billion in fiscal years 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively.  stock-based compensation  compensation cost for stock awards, which include restricted stock units (\u201crsus\u201d) and performance stock units (\u201cpsus\u201d), is measured at the fair value on the grant date and recognized as expense, net of estimated forfeitures, over the related service or performance period. the fair value of stock awards is based on the quoted price of our common stock on the grant date less the present value of expected dividends not received during the vesting period. we measure the fair value of psus using a monte carlo valuation model. compensation cost for rsus is recognized using the straight-line method and for psus is recognized using the accelerated method. compensation expense for the employee stock purchase plan (\u201cespp\u201d) is measured as the discount the employee is entitled to upon purchase and is recognized in the period of purchase. income taxes  income tax expense includes u.s. and international income taxes, and interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions. certain income and expenses are not reported in tax returns and financial statements in the same year. the tax effect of such temporary differences is reported as deferred income taxes. deferred tax assets are reported net of a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized. all deferred income taxes are classified as long-term in our consolidated balance sheets.  financial instruments investments we consider all highly liquid interest-earning investments with a maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase to be cash equivalents. the fair values of these investments approximate their carrying values. in general, investments with original maturities of greater than three months and remaining maturities of less than one year are classified as short-term investments. investments with maturities beyond one year may be classified as short-term based on their highly liquid nature and because such marketable securities represent the investment of cash that is available for current operations.  66part ii item 8 \u00a0 debt investments are classified as available-for-sale and realized gains and losses are recorded using the specific identification method. changes in fair value, excluding credit losses and impairments, are recorded in other comprehensive income. fair value is calculated based on publicly available market information or other estimates determined by management. if the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value, we evaluate, among other factors, general market conditions, credit quality of debt instrument issuers, and the extent to which the fair value is less than cost. to determine credit losses, we employ a systematic methodology that considers available quantitative and qualitative evidence. in addition, we consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of, and business outlook for, the investee. if we have plans to sell the security or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery, then a decline in fair value below cost is recorded as an impairment charge in other income (expense), net and a new cost basis in the investment is established. if market, industry, and/or investee conditions deteriorate, we may incur future impairments. equity investments with readily determinable fair values are measured at fair value. equity investments without readily determinable fair values are measured using the equity method or measured at cost with adjustments for observable changes in price or impairments (referred to as the measurement alternative). we perform a qualitative assessment on a periodic basis and recognize an impairment if there are sufficient indicators that the fair value of the investment is less than carrying value. changes in value are recorded in other income (expense), net.  derivatives derivative instruments are recognized as either assets or liabilities and measured at fair value. the accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation.  for derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges, gains and losses are recognized in other income (expense), net with offsetting gains and losses on the hedged items. gains and losses representing hedge components excluded from the assessment of effectiveness are recognized in other income (expense), net. for derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges, gains and losses are initially reported as a component of other comprehensive income and subsequently recognized in earnings with the corresponding hedged item. gains and losses representing hedge components excluded from the assessment of effectiveness are recognized in earnings.  for derivative instruments that are not designated as hedges, gains and losses from changes in fair values are primarily recognized in other income (expense), net. fair value measurements we account for certain assets and liabilities at fair value. the hierarchy below lists three levels of fair value based on the extent to which inputs used in measuring fair value are observable in the market.\u00a0we categorize each of our fair value measurements in one of these three levels based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. these levels are:      67part ii item 8 \u00a0   we measure equity investments without readily determinable fair values on a nonrecurring basis. the fair values of these investments are determined based on valuation techniques using the best information available, and may include quoted market prices, market comparables, and discounted cash flow projections.  our other current financial assets and current financial liabilities have fair values that approximate their carrying values. inventories  inventories are stated at average cost, subject to the lower of cost or net realizable value. cost includes materials, labor, and manufacturing overhead related to the purchase and production of inventories. net realizable value is the estimated selling price less estimated costs of completion, disposal, and transportation. we regularly review inventory quantities on hand, future purchase commitments with our suppliers, and the estimated utility of our inventory. if our review indicates a reduction in utility below carrying value, we reduce our inventory to a new cost basis through a charge to cost of revenue.  property and equipment  property and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation, and depreciated using the straight-line method over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the asset or the lease term. the estimated useful lives of our property and equipment are generally as follows: computer software developed or acquired for internal use, three to seven years; computer equipment, two to four years; buildings and improvements, five to 15 years; leasehold improvements, three to 20 years; and furniture and equipment, one to 10 years. land is not depreciated.  leases we determine if an arrangement is a lease at inception. operating leases are included in operating lease right-of-use (\u201crou\u201d) assets, other current liabilities, and operating lease liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets. finance leases are included in property and equipment, other current liabilities, and other long-term liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets.  rou assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. operating lease rou assets and liabilities are recognized at commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. as most of our leases do not provide an implicit rate, we generally use our incremental borrowing rate based on the estimated rate of interest for collateralized borrowing over a similar term of the lease payments at commencement date. the operating lease rou asset also includes any lease payments made and excludes lease incentives. our lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. lease expense for lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.  we have lease agreements with lease and non-lease components, which are generally accounted for separately. for certain equipment leases, such as vehicles, we account for the lease and non-lease components as a single lease component. additionally, for certain equipment leases, we apply a portfolio approach to effectively account for the operating lease rou assets and liabilities.  goodwill  goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level (operating segment or one level below an operating segment) on an annual basis (may 1 for us) and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value.  68part ii item 8 \u00a0 intangible assets  our intangible assets are subject to amortization and are amortized using the straight-line method over their estimated period of benefit, ranging from one to 20 years. we evaluate the recoverability of intangible assets periodically by taking into account events or circumstances that may warrant revised estimates of useful lives or that indicate the asset may be impaired.  recent accounting guidance  recently adopted accounting guidance financial instruments \u2013 credit losses  in june 2016, the fasb issued a new standard to replace the incurred loss impairment methodology under current gaap with a methodology that reflects expected credit losses and requires consideration of a broader range of reasonable and supportable information to inform credit loss estimates. we adopted the standard effective july 1, 2020. we use a forward-looking expected credit loss model for accounts receivable, loans, and other financial instruments. credit losses relating to available-for-sale debt securities are recorded through an allowance for credit losses rather than as a reduction in the amortized cost basis of the securities. we applied a modified retrospective approach through a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the effective date to align our credit loss methodology with the new standard. the adoption of the standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. recent accounting guidance not yet adopted accounting for income taxes in december 2019, the fasb issued a new standard to simplify the accounting for income taxes. the guidance eliminates certain exceptions related to the approach for intraperiod tax allocation, the methodology for calculating income taxes in an interim period, and the recognition of deferred tax liabilities for outside basis differences related to changes in ownership of equity method investments and foreign subsidiaries. the guidance also simplifies aspects of accounting for franchise taxes and enacted changes in tax laws or rates, and clarifies the accounting for transactions that result in a step-up in the tax basis of goodwill. the standard will be effective for us beginning july 1, 2021. we have completed our assessment and concluded that adoption of the new standard will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. note 2 \u2014 earnings per share basic earnings per share (\u201ceps\u201d) is computed based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. diluted eps is computed based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock plus the effect of dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period using the treasury stock method. dilutive potential common shares include outstanding stock options and stock awards.  the components of basic and diluted eps were as follows:  \u00a0   \u00a0 anti-dilutive stock-based awards excluded from the calculations of diluted eps were immaterial during the periods presented. 69part ii item 8 \u00a0 note 3 \u2014 other income (expense), net  the components of other income (expense), net were as follows:  \u00a0   \u00a0 net recognized gains (losses) on investments  net recognized gains (losses) on debt investments were as follows:  \u00a0   \u00a0 net recognized gains (losses) on equity investments were as follows: \u00a0   \u00a0 70part ii item 8 \u00a0 note 4\u00a0\u2014\u00a0investments investment components  the components of investments were as follows:  \u00a0   71part ii item 8 \u00a0 \u00a0   \u00a0   \u00a0 equity investments presented as \u201cother\u201d in the tables above include investments without readily determinable fair values measured using the equity method or measured at cost with adjustments for observable changes in price or impairments, and investments measured at fair value using net asset value as a practical expedient which are not categorized in the fair value hierarchy. as of june 30, 2021 and 2020, equity investments without readily determinable fair values measured at cost with adjustments for observable changes in price or impairments were $3.3 billion and $1.4 billion, respectively.  unrealized losses on debt investments  debt investments with continuous unrealized losses for less than 12 months and 12 months or greater and their related fair values were as follows:  \u00a0   72part ii item 8 \u00a0 \u00a0   \u00a0 unrealized losses from fixed-income securities are primarily attributable to changes in interest rates. management does not believe any remaining unrealized losses represent impairments based on our evaluation of available evidence.  debt investment maturities  \u00a0   \u00a0 note 5 \u2014 derivatives  we use derivative instruments to manage risks related to foreign currencies, interest rates, equity prices, and credit; to enhance investment returns; and to facilitate portfolio diversification. our objectives for holding derivatives include reducing, eliminating, and efficiently managing the economic impact of these exposures as effectively as possible. our derivative programs include strategies that both qualify and do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment.  foreign currencies  certain forecasted transactions, assets, and liabilities are exposed to foreign currency risk. we monitor our foreign currency exposures daily to maximize the economic effectiveness of our foreign currency hedge positions.  foreign currency risks related to certain non-u.s. dollar-denominated investments are hedged using foreign exchange forward contracts that are designated as fair value hedging instruments. foreign currency risks related to certain euro-denominated debt are hedged using foreign exchange forward contracts that are designated as cash flow hedging instruments. in the past, option and forward contracts were used to hedge a portion of forecasted international revenue and were designated as cash flow hedging instruments. principal currencies hedged included the euro, japanese yen, british pound, canadian dollar, and australian dollar.  certain options and forwards not designated as hedging instruments are also used to manage the variability in foreign exchange rates on certain balance sheet amounts and to manage other foreign currency exposures.  interest rate  interest rate risks related to certain fixed-rate debt are hedged using interest rate swaps that are designated as fair value hedging instruments to effectively convert the fixed interest rates to floating interest rates. 73part ii item 8 \u00a0 securities held in our fixed-income portfolio are subject to different interest rate risks based on their maturities. we manage the average maturity of our fixed-income portfolio to achieve economic returns that correlate to certain broad-based fixed-income indices using exchange-traded option and futures contracts and over-the-counter swap and option contracts. these contracts are not designated as hedging instruments and are included in \u201cother contracts\u201d in the tables below. equity  securities held in our equity investments portfolio are subject to market price risk.\u00a0at times, we may hold options, futures, and swap contracts. these contracts are not designated as hedging instruments and are included in \u201cother contracts\u201d in the tables below. credit  our fixed-income portfolio is diversified and consists primarily of investment-grade securities. we use credit default swap contracts to manage credit exposures relative to broad-based indices and to facilitate portfolio diversification. these contracts are not designated as hedging instruments and are included in \u201cother contracts\u201d in the tables below. credit-risk-related contingent features  certain of our counterparty agreements for derivative instruments contain provisions that require our issued and outstanding long-term unsecured debt to maintain an investment grade credit rating and require us to maintain minimum liquidity of $1.0 billion. to the extent we fail to meet these requirements, we will be required to post collateral, similar to the standard convention related to over-the-counter derivatives. as of june 30, 2021, our long-term unsecured debt rating was aaa, and cash investments were in excess of $1.0 billion. as a result, no collateral was required to be posted.  the following table presents the notional amounts of our outstanding derivative instruments measured in u.s. dollar equivalents: \u00a0   \u00a0 74part ii item 8 \u00a0 fair values of derivative instruments  the following table presents our derivative instruments:  \u00a0   \u00a0 gross derivative assets and liabilities subject to legally enforceable master netting agreements for which we have elected to offset were $395 million and $335 million, respectively, as of june 30, 2021, and $399 million and $399 million, respectively, as of june 30, 2020.\u00a0 the following table presents the fair value of our derivatives instruments on a gross basis: \u00a0   \u00a0 75part ii item 8 \u00a0 gains (losses) on derivative instruments recognized in our consolidated income statements were as follows: \u00a0   \u00a0 gains (losses), net of tax, on derivative instruments recognized in our consolidated comprehensive income statements were as follows: \u00a0   \u00a0 note 6\u00a0\u2014\u00a0inventories the components of inventories were as follows: \u00a0   \u00a0 76part ii item 8 \u00a0 note 7 \u2014 property and equipment  the components of property and equipment were as follows:  \u00a0   \u00a0 during fiscal years 2021, 2020, and 2019, depreciation expense was $9.3 billion, $10.7 billion, and $9.7 billion, respectively. depreciation expense declined in fiscal year 2021 due to the change in estimated useful lives of our server and network equipment. we have committed $9.5 billion for the construction of new buildings, building improvements, and leasehold improvements as of june 30, 2021.  during fiscal year 2020, we recorded an impairment charge of $186 million to property and equipment, primarily to leasehold improvements, due to the closing of our microsoft store physical locations. note 8 \u2014 business combinations  zenimax media inc. on march 9, 2021, we completed our acquisition of zenimax media inc. (\u201czenimax\u201d), the parent company of bethesda softworks llc (\u201cbethesda\u201d), for a total purchase price of $8.1 billion, consisting primarily of cash. the purchase price included $768 million of cash and cash equivalents acquired. bethesda is one of the largest, privately held game developers and publishers in the world, and brings a broad portfolio of games, technology, and talent to xbox. the financial results of zenimax have been included in our consolidated financial statements since the date of the acquisition. zenimax is reported as part of our more personal computing segment. the purchase price allocation as of the date of acquisition was based on a preliminary valuation and is subject to revision as more detailed analyses are completed and additional information about the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed becomes available. the major classes of assets and liabilities to which we have preliminarily allocated the purchase price were as follows: \u00a0   \u00a0 goodwill was assigned to our more personal computing segment. the goodwill was primarily attributed to increased synergies that are expected to be achieved from the integration of zenimax. none of the goodwill is expected to be deductible for income tax purposes. 77part ii item 8 \u00a0 following are details of the purchase price allocated to the intangible assets acquired: \u00a0   \u00a0 github, inc. on october 25, 2018, we acquired github, inc. (\u201cgithub\u201d), a software development platform, in a $7.5 billion stock transaction (inclusive of total cash payments of $1.3 billion in respect of vested github equity awards and an indemnity escrow). the acquisition is expected to empower developers to achieve more at every stage of the development lifecycle, accelerate enterprise use of github, and bring microsoft\u2019s developer tools and services to new audiences. the financial results of github have been included in our consolidated financial statements since the date of the acquisition. github is reported as part of our intelligent cloud segment. the allocation of the purchase price to goodwill was completed as of june 30, 2019. the major classes of assets and liabilities to which we allocated the purchase price were as follows:\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0   \u00a0 the goodwill recognized in connection with the acquisition is primarily attributable to anticipated synergies from future growth and is not expected to be deductible for tax purposes. we assigned the goodwill to our intelligent cloud segment.\u00a0\u00a0 following are the details of the purchase price allocated to the intangible assets acquired:  \u00a0   \u00a0 transactions recognized separately from the purchase price allocation were approximately $600 million, primarily related to equity awards recognized as expense over the related service period.  nuance communications, inc. on april 11, 2021, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire nuance communications, inc. (\u201cnuance\u201d) for $56.00 per share in an all-cash transaction valued at $19.7 billion, inclusive of nuance\u2019s net debt. nuance is a cloud and artificial intelligence (\u201cai\u201d) software provider with healthcare and enterprise ai experience, and the acquisition will build on our industry-specific cloud offerings. the acquisition has been approved by nuance\u2019s shareholders, and we expect it to close by the end of calendar year 2021, subject to the satisfaction of certain regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions. 78part ii item 8 \u00a0 note 9 \u2014 goodwill  changes in the carrying amount of goodwill were as follows: \u00a0   \u00a0   the measurement periods for the valuation of assets acquired and liabilities assumed end as soon as information on the facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition dates becomes available, but do not exceed 12 months. adjustments in purchase price allocations may require a change in the amounts allocated to goodwill during the periods in which the adjustments are determined.  any change in the goodwill amounts resulting from foreign currency translations and purchase accounting adjustments are presented as \u201cother\u201d in the table above. also included in \u201cother\u201d are business dispositions and transfers between segments due to reorganizations, as applicable.  goodwill impairment\u00a0\u00a0 we test goodwill for impairment annually on may\u00a01 at the reporting unit level, primarily using a discounted cash flow methodology with a peer-based, risk-adjusted weighted average cost of capital. we believe use of a discounted cash flow approach is the most reliable indicator of the fair values of the businesses.  no instances of impairment were identified in our may 1, 2021, may 1, 2020, or may 1, 2019 tests. as of june 30, 2021 and 2020, accumulated goodwill impairment was $11.3 billion. note 10\u00a0\u2014\u00a0intangible assets  the components of intangible assets, all of which are finite-lived, were as follows:  \u00a0   \u00a0   no material impairments of intangible assets were identified during fiscal years 2021, 2020, or 2019. we estimate that we have no significant residual value related to our intangible assets.  79part ii item 8 \u00a0 the components of intangible assets acquired during the periods presented were as follows:  \u00a0   \u00a0 intangible assets amortization expense was $1.6 billion, $1.6 billion, and $1.9 billion for fiscal years 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively.  the following table outlines the estimated future amortization expense related to intangible assets held as of june 30, 2021: \u00a0   \u00a0 80part ii item 8 \u00a0 note 11\u00a0\u2014\u00a0debt  the components of debt were as follows:  \u00a0   \u00a0     as of june 30, 2021 and 2020, the estimated fair value of long-term debt, including the current portion, was $70.0 billion and $77.1 billion, respectively. the estimated fair values are based on level 2 inputs.  debt in the table above is comprised of senior unsecured obligations and ranks equally with our other outstanding obligations. interest is paid semi-annually, except for the euro-denominated debt, which is paid annually. cash paid for interest on our debt for fiscal years 2021, 2020, and 2019 was $2.0 billion, $2.4 billion, and $2.4 billion, respectively.\u00a0 the following table outlines maturities of our long-term debt, including the current portion, as of june 30, 2021:  \u00a0   \u00a0 81part ii item 8 \u00a0 note 12\u00a0\u2014\u00a0income taxes  tax cuts and jobs act on december 22, 2017, the tax cuts and jobs act (\u201ctcja\u201d) was enacted into law, which significantly changed existing u.s. tax law and included numerous provisions that affect our business. we recorded a provisional net charge of $13.7 billion related to the enactment of the tcja in fiscal year 2018 and adjusted the provisional net charge by recording additional tax expense of $157 million in fiscal year 2019 pursuant to securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin no. 118.  in fiscal year 2019, in response to the tcja and recently issued regulations, we transferred certain intangible properties held by our foreign subsidiaries to the u.s. and ireland. the transfers of intangible properties resulted in a $2.6 billion net income tax benefit recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2019, as the value of future tax deductions exceeded the current tax liability from foreign jurisdictions and u.s. global intangible low-taxed income (\u201cgilti\u201d) tax.  provision for income taxes\u00a0\u00a0 the components of the provision for income taxes were as follows:  \u00a0   \u00a0 u.s. and foreign components of income before income taxes were as follows:  \u00a0   \u00a0 82part ii item 8 \u00a0 effective tax rate the items accounting for the difference between income taxes computed at the u.s. federal statutory rate and our effective rate were as follows:  \u00a0   \u00a0 we have historically paid india withholding taxes on software sales through distributor withholding and tax audit assessments in india. in march 2021, the india supreme court ruled favorably in the case of engineering analysis centre of excellence private limited vs the commissioner of income tax for companies in 86 separate appeals, some dating back to 2012, holding that software sales are not subject to india withholding taxes. although we were not a party to the appeals, our software sales in india were determined to be not subject to withholding taxes. therefore, we recorded a net income tax benefit of $620\u00a0million in the third quarter of fiscal year 2021 to reflect the results of the india supreme court decision impacting fiscal year\u00a01996\u00a0through fiscal year\u00a02016. the decrease from the federal statutory rate in fiscal year 2021 is primarily due to earnings taxed at lower rates in foreign jurisdictions resulting from producing and distributing our products and services through our foreign regional operations centers in ireland and puerto rico, tax benefits relating to stock-based compensation, and tax benefits from the india supreme court decision on withholding taxes. the decrease from the federal statutory rate in fiscal year 2020 is primarily due to earnings taxed at lower rates in foreign jurisdictions resulting from producing and distributing our products and services through our foreign regional operations centers in ireland and puerto rico, and tax benefits relating to stock-based compensation. the decrease from the federal statutory rate in fiscal year 2019 is primarily due to a $2.6 billion net income tax benefit related to intangible property transfers, and earnings taxed at lower rates in foreign jurisdictions resulting from producing and distributing our products and services through our foreign regional operations centers in ireland, singapore, and puerto rico. in fiscal year 2021 and 2020, our foreign regional operating centers in ireland and puerto rico, which are taxed at rates lower than the u.s. rate, generated 82% and 86% of our foreign income before tax. in fiscal years 2019, our foreign regional operating centers in ireland, singapore, and puerto rico, which are taxed at rates lower than the u.s. rate, generated 82% of our foreign income before tax, respectively. other reconciling items, net consists primarily of tax credits and gilti tax, and in fiscal year 2021, includes tax benefits from the india supreme court decision on withholding taxes. in fiscal years 2021, 2020, and 2019, there were no individually significant other reconciling items. 83part ii item 8 \u00a0 the decrease in our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2021 compared to fiscal year 2020 was primarily due to tax benefits from the india supreme court decision on withholding taxes, an agreement between the u.s. and india tax authorities related to transfer pricing, final tcja regulations, and an increase in tax benefits relating to stock-based compensation. the increase in our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2020 compared to fiscal year 2019 was primarily due to a $2.6 billion net income tax benefit in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2019 related to intangible property transfers. the components of the deferred income tax assets and liabilities were as follows: \u00a0 \u00a0   \u00a0 deferred income tax balances reflect the effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases and are stated at enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when the taxes are paid or recovered.  as of june 30, 2021, we had federal, state, and foreign net operating loss carryforwards of $304 million, $1.3 billion, and $2.0 billion, respectively. the federal and state net operating loss carryforwards will expire in various years from fiscal 2022 through 2041, if not utilized. the majority of our foreign net operating loss carryforwards do not expire. certain acquired net operating loss carryforwards are subject to an annual limitation but are expected to be realized with the exception of those which have a valuation allowance. the valuation allowance disclosed in the table above relates to the foreign net operating loss carryforwards and other net deferred tax assets that may not be realized. in fiscal year 2020, we removed $2.0 billion of foreign net operating losses and corresponding valuation allowances as a result of the liquidation of a foreign subsidiary. there was no impact to our consolidated financial statements. income taxes paid, net of refunds, were $13.4 billion, $12.5 billion, and $8.4 billion in fiscal years 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively.  84part ii item 8 \u00a0 uncertain tax positions gross unrecognized tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions as of june 30, 2021, 2020, and 2019, were $14.6 billion, $13.8 billion, and $13.1 billion, respectively, which were primarily included in long-term income taxes in our consolidated balance sheets. if recognized, the resulting tax benefit would affect our effective tax rates for fiscal years 2021, 2020, and 2019 by $12.5 billion, $12.1 billion, and $12.0 billion, respectively. as of june 30, 2021, 2020, and 2019, we had accrued interest expense related to uncertain tax positions of $4.3 billion, $4.0 billion, and $3.4 billion, respectively, net of income tax benefits. the provision for income taxes for fiscal years 2021, 2020, and 2019 included interest expense related to uncertain tax positions of $274 million, $579 million, and $515 million, respectively, net of income tax benefits. the aggregate changes in the gross unrecognized tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions were as follows: \u00a0   \u00a0 we settled a portion of the internal revenue service (\u201cirs\u201d) audit for tax years 2004 to 2006 in fiscal year 2011. in february 2012, the irs withdrew its 2011 revenue agents report related to unresolved issues for tax years 2004 to 2006 and reopened the audit phase of the examination. we also settled a portion of the irs audit for tax years 2007 to 2009 in fiscal year 2016, and a portion of the irs audit for tax years 2010 to 2013 in fiscal year 2018. in the second quarter of fiscal year 2021, we settled an additional portion of the irs audits for tax years 2004 to 2013 and made a payment of $1.7 billion, including tax and interest. we remain under audit for tax years 2004 to 2017. as of june 30, 2021, the primary unresolved issues for the irs audits relate to transfer pricing, which could have a material impact in our consolidated financial statements when the matters are resolved. we believe our allowances for income tax contingencies are adequate. we have not received a proposed assessment for the unresolved key transfer pricing issues and do not expect a final resolution of these issues in the next 12 months.\u00a0based on the information currently available, we do not anticipate a significant increase or decrease to our tax contingencies for these issues within the next 12 months. we are subject to income tax in many jurisdictions outside the u.s. our operations in certain jurisdictions remain subject to examination for tax years 1996 to 2020, some of which are currently under audit by local tax authorities. the resolution of each of these audits is not expected to be material to our consolidated financial statements. \u00a0 note 13 \u2014 unearned revenue  unearned revenue by segment was as follows:  \u00a0   \u00a0 85part ii item 8 \u00a0 changes in unearned revenue were as follows: \u00a0   \u00a0 revenue allocated to remaining performance obligations, which includes unearned revenue and amounts that will be invoiced and recognized as revenue in future periods, was $146 billion as of june 30, 2021, of which $141 billion is related to the commercial portion of revenue. we expect to recognize approximately 50% of this revenue over the next 12 months and the remainder thereafter. note 14\u00a0\u2014\u00a0leases  we have operating and finance leases for datacenters, corporate offices, research and development facilities, microsoft experience centers, and certain equipment. our leases have remaining lease terms of 1 year to 15 years, some of which include options to extend the leases for up to 5 years, and some of which include options to terminate the leases within 1 year.  the components of lease expense were as follows: \u00a0   \u00a0 \u00a0 supplemental cash flow information related to leases was as follows: \u00a0   \u00a0 86part ii item 8 \u00a0 supplemental balance sheet information related to leases was as follows: \u00a0   \u00a0 the following table outlines maturities of our lease liabilities as of june 30, 2021: \u00a0   \u00a0 as of june 30, 2021, we have additional operating and finance leases, primarily for datacenters, that have not yet commenced of $5.4 billion and $7.3 billion, respectively. these operating and finance leases will commence between fiscal year 2022 and fiscal year 2026 with lease terms of 1 year to 15 years. during fiscal year 2020, we recorded an impairment charge of $161 million to operating lease right-of-use assets due to the closing of our microsoft store physical locations. \u00a0 87part ii item 8 \u00a0 note 15 \u2014 contingencies patent and intellectual property claims  there were 63 patent infringement cases pending against microsoft as of june 30, 2021, none of which are material individually or in aggregate.  antitrust, unfair competition, and overcharge class actions  antitrust and unfair competition class action lawsuits were filed against us in british columbia, ontario, and quebec, canada. all three have been certified on behalf of canadian indirect purchasers who acquired licenses for microsoft operating system software and/or productivity application software between 1998 and 2010.  the trial of the british columbia action commenced in may 2016. following a mediation, the parties agreed to a global settlement of all three canadian actions and submitted the proposed settlement agreement to the courts in all three jurisdictions for approval. the final settlement and form of notice have been approved by the courts in british columbia, ontario, and quebec. the ten-month claims period commenced on november 23, 2020 and will close on september 23, 2021. other antitrust litigation and claims  china state administration for market regulation investigation  in 2014, microsoft was informed that china\u2019s state agency for market regulation (\u201csamr\u201d) (formerly state administration for industry and commerce) had begun a formal investigation relating to china\u2019s anti-monopoly law, and the samr conducted onsite inspections of microsoft offices in beijing, shanghai, guangzhou, and chengdu. in 2019, the samr presented preliminary views as to certain possible violations of china\u2019s anti-monopoly law. product-related litigation   u.s. cell phone litigation  microsoft mobile oy, a subsidiary of microsoft, along with other handset manufacturers and network operators, is a defendant in 46 lawsuits, including 45 lawsuits filed in the superior court for the district of columbia by individual plaintiffs who allege that radio emissions from cellular handsets caused their brain tumors and other adverse health effects. we assumed responsibility for these claims in our agreement to acquire nokia\u2019s devices and services business and have been substituted for the nokia defendants. nine of these cases were filed in 2002 and are consolidated for certain pre-trial proceedings; the remaining cases are stayed. in a separate 2009 decision, the court of appeals for the district of columbia held that adverse health effect claims arising from the use of cellular handsets that operate within the u.s. federal communications commission radio frequency emission guidelines (\u201cfcc guidelines\u201d) are pre-empted by federal law. the plaintiffs allege that their handsets either operated outside the fcc guidelines or were manufactured before the fcc guidelines went into effect. the lawsuits also allege an industry-wide conspiracy to manipulate the science and testing around emission guidelines.  in 2013, the defendants in the consolidated cases moved to exclude the plaintiffs\u2019 expert evidence of general causation on the basis of flawed scientific methodologies. in 2014, the trial court granted in part and denied in part the defendants\u2019 motion to exclude the plaintiffs\u2019 general causation experts. the defendants filed an interlocutory appeal to the district of columbia court of appeals challenging the standard for evaluating expert scientific evidence. in october 2016, the court of appeals issued its decision adopting the standard advocated by the defendants and remanding the cases to the trial court for further proceedings under that standard. the plaintiffs have filed supplemental expert evidence, portions of which the defendants have moved to strike. in august 2018, the trial court issued an order striking portions of the plaintiffs\u2019 expert reports. a hearing on general causation is scheduled for january and february of 2022. 88part ii item 8 \u00a0 other contingencies  we also are subject to a variety of other claims and suits that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of our business. although management currently believes that resolving claims against us, individually or in aggregate, will not have a material adverse impact in our consolidated financial statements, these matters are subject to inherent uncertainties and management\u2019s view of these matters may change in the future.  as of june 30, 2021, we accrued aggregate legal liabilities of $339 million. while we intend to defend these matters vigorously, adverse outcomes that we estimate could reach approximately $500 million in aggregate beyond recorded amounts are reasonably possible. were unfavorable final outcomes to occur, there exists the possibility of a material adverse impact in our consolidated financial statements for the period in which the effects become reasonably estimable.  note 16\u00a0\u2014\u00a0stockholders\u2019 equity

to our segments. however, due to the integrated structure of our business, certain revenue recognized and costs incurred by one segment may benefit other segments. revenue from certain contracts is allocated among the segments based on the relative value of the underlying products and services, which can include allocation based on actual prices charged, prices when sold separately, or estimated costs plus a profit margin. cost of revenue is allocated in certain cases based on a relative revenue methodology. operating expenses that are allocated primarily include those relating to marketing of products and services from which multiple segments benefit and are generally allocated based on relative gross margin.  in addition, certain costs incurred at a corporate level that are identifiable and that benefit our segments are allocated to them. these allocated costs include legal, including settlements and fines, information technology, human resources, finance, excise taxes,

and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended june 30, 2021, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america. we have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board (united states) (pcaob), the company's internal control over financial reporting as of june 30, 2021, based on criteria established in internal control \u2014 integrated framework (2013) issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission and our report dated july 29, 2021, expressed an unqualified opinion on the company's internal control over financial reporting. basis for opinion these financial statements are the responsibility of the company's management. our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company's financial statements based on our audits. we are a public accounting firm registered with the pcaob and are required to be independent with respect to the company in accordance with the u.s. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the securities and exchange commission and the pcaob. we conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the pcaob. those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. we believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. critical audit matters the critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. the communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.  96part ii item 8 \u00a0 revenue recognition \u2013 refer to note 1 to the financial statements critical audit matter description the company recognizes revenue upon transfer of control of promised products or services to customers in an amount that reflects the

including cloud-based services, in its customer agreements through its volume licensing programs. significant judgment is exercised by the company in determining revenue recognition for these customer agreements, and includes the following:         given these factors and due to the volume of transactions, the related audit effort in evaluating management's judgments in determining revenue

resolution of the remaining matters could have a material impact on the company's financial statements.  conclusions on recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions involve significant estimates and management judgment and include complex considerations of the internal revenue code, related regulations, tax case laws, and prior-year audit settlements. given the complexity and the subjective nature of the transfer pricing issues that remain unresolved with the irs, evaluating management's estimates relating to their determination of uncertain tax positions required extensive audit effort and a high degree of auditor judgment, including involvement of our tax specialists. how the critical audit matter was addressed in the audit our principal audit procedures to evaluate management's estimates of uncertain tax positions related to unresolved transfer pricing issues included the following:           \u00a0 /s/ deloitte\u00a0& touche llp \u00a0 seattle, washington\u00a0\u00a0 july

us based on a growing variety of business models.        the competitive pressures described above may cause decreased sales volumes, price reductions, and/or increased operating costs, such as for research and development, marketing, and sales incentives. this may lead to lower revenue, gross margins, and operating income.  our increasing focus on cloud-based services presents execution and competitive risks.\u00a0a growing part of our business involves cloud-based services available across the spectrum of computing devices. our strategic vision is to compete and grow by building best-in-class platforms and productivity services for an intelligent cloud and an intelligent edge infused with artificial intelligence (\u201cai\u201d). at the same time, our competitors are rapidly developing and deploying cloud-based services for consumers and business customers. pricing and delivery models are evolving. devices and form factors influence how users access services in the cloud and sometimes the user\u2019s choice of which suite of cloud-based services to use. we are devoting significant resources to develop and deploy our cloud-based strategies. the windows ecosystem must continue to evolve with this changing environment. we are undertaking cultural and organizational changes to drive accountability and eliminate obstacles to innovation. our intelligent cloud and intelligent edge worldview is connected with the growth of the internet of things (\u201ciot\u201d). our success in the iot will depend on the level of adoption of our offerings such as microsoft azure, azure stack, azure iot edge, and azure sphere. we may not establish market share sufficient to achieve scale necessary to achieve our business objectives. besides software development costs, we are incurring costs to build and maintain infrastructure to support cloud computing services. these costs will reduce the operating margins we have previously achieved. whether we succeed in cloud-based services depends on our execution in several areas, including:            it is uncertain whether our strategies will attract the users or generate the revenue required to succeed. if we are not effective in executing organizational and technical changes to increase efficiency and accelerate innovation, or if we fail to generate sufficient usage of our new products and services, we may not grow revenue in line with the infrastructure and development investments described above. this may negatively impact gross margins and operating income.  18part i item 1a \u00a0 we make significant investments in new products and services that may not achieve expected returns.\u00a0we will continue to make significant investments in research, development, and marketing for existing products, services, and technologies, including the windows operating system, microsoft 365, office, bing, microsoft sql server, windows server, the windows store, azure, office 365, xbox live, mixer, linkedin, and other cloud-based offerings. we also invest in the development and acquisition of a variety of hardware for productivity, communication, and entertainment including pcs, tablets, gaming devices, and hololens. investments in new technology are speculative. commercial success depends on many factors, including innovativeness, developer support, and effective distribution and marketing. if customers do not perceive our latest offerings as providing significant new functionality or other value, they may reduce their purchases of new software and hardware products or upgrades, unfavorably affecting revenue. we may not achieve significant revenue from new product, service, and distribution channel investments for several years, if at all. new products and services may not be profitable, and even if they are profitable, operating margins for some new products and businesses will not be as high as the margins we have experienced historically. we may not get engagement in certain features, like windows store, microsoft edge, and bing, that drive post-license monetization opportunities. our data handling practices across our products and services will continue to be under scrutiny and perceptions of mismanagement, driven by regulatory activity or negative public reaction to our practices or product experiences, which could negatively impact product and feature adoption, product design, and product quality. developing new technologies is complex. it can require long development and testing periods. significant delays in new releases or significant problems in creating new products or services could adversely affect our revenue.  acquisitions, joint ventures, and strategic alliances may have an adverse effect on our business.\u00a0we expect to continue making acquisitions and entering into joint ventures and strategic alliances as part of our long-term business strategy. in december 2016, we completed our acquisition of linkedin corporation for $27.0 billion. in june 2018, we announced an agreement to acquire github, inc. for $7.5 billion. these acquisitions and other transactions and arrangements involve significant challenges and risks, including that they do not advance our business strategy, that we get an unsatisfactory return on our investment, that we have difficulty integrating and retaining new employees, business systems, and technology, or that they distract management from our other businesses. if an arrangement fails to adequately anticipate changing circumstances and interests of a party, it may result in early termination or renegotiation of the arrangement. the success of these transactions and arrangements will depend in part on our ability to leverage them to enhance our existing products and services or develop compelling new ones. it may take longer than expected to realize the full benefits from these transactions and arrangements, such as increased revenue, enhanced efficiencies, or increased market share, or the benefits may ultimately be smaller than we expected. these events could adversely affect our operating results or financial condition.  if our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets become impaired, we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings.\u00a0we acquire other companies and intangible assets and may not realize all the economic benefit from those acquisitions, which could cause an impairment of goodwill or intangibles. we review our amortizable intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. we test goodwill for impairment at least annually. factors that may be a change in circumstances, indicating that the carrying value of our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets may not be recoverable, include a decline in our stock price and market capitalization, reduced future cash flow estimates, and slower growth rates in industry segments in which we participate. we have in the past recorded, and may in the future be required to record a significant charge in our consolidated financial statements during the period in which any impairment of our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets is determined, negatively affecting our results of operations. our acquisition of linkedin resulted in a significant increase in our goodwill and intangible asset balances.  we may not earn the revenues we expect from our intellectual property rights.  we may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property rights  protecting our intellectual property rights and combating unlicensed copying and use of our software and other intellectual property on a global basis is difficult. while piracy adversely affects u.s. revenue, the impact on revenue from outside the u.s. is more significant, particularly countries in which the legal system provides less protection for intellectual property rights. our revenue in these markets may grow more slowly than the underlying device market. similarly, the absence of harmonized patent laws makes it more difficult to ensure consistent respect for patent rights. throughout the world, we educate users about the benefits of licensing genuine products and obtaining indemnification benefits for intellectual property risks, and we educate lawmakers about the advantages of a business climate where intellectual property rights are protected. reductions in the legal protection for software intellectual property rights could adversely affect revenue.  19part i item 1a \u00a0 we may not receive expected royalties from our patent licenses  we expend significant resources to patent the intellectual property we create with the expectation that we will generate revenues by incorporating that intellectual property in our products or services or, in some instances, by licensing our patents to others in return for a royalty.\u00a0changes in the law may continue to weaken our ability to prevent the use of patented technology or collect revenue for licensing our patents.\u00a0these include legislative changes and regulatory actions that make it more difficult to obtain injunctions, and the increasing use of legal process to challenge issued patents. similarly, licensees of our patents may fail to satisfy their obligations to pay us royalties, or may contest the scope and extent of their obligations. finally, the royalties we can obtain to monetize our intellectual property may decline because of the evolution of technology, selling price changes in products using licensed patents, or the difficulty of discovering infringements. finally, our increasing engagement with open source software will also cause us to license our intellectual property rights broadly in certain situations and may negatively impact revenue. third parties may claim we infringe their intellectual property rights.\u00a0from time to time, others claim we infringe their intellectual property rights. the number of these claims may grow because of constant technological change in the markets in which we compete, the extensive patent coverage of existing technologies, the rapid rate of issuance of new patents, and our offering of first-party devices, such as microsoft surface. to resolve these claims, we may enter into royalty and licensing agreements on terms that are less favorable than currently available, stop selling or redesign affected products or services, or pay damages to satisfy indemnification commitments with our customers. these outcomes may cause operating margins to decline. besides money damages, in some jurisdictions plaintiffs can seek injunctive relief that may limit or prevent importing, marketing, and selling our products or services that have infringing technologies. in some countries, such as germany, an injunction can be issued before the parties have fully litigated the validity of the underlying patents. we have paid significant amounts to settle claims related to the use of technology and intellectual property rights and to procure intellectual property rights as part of our strategy to manage this risk, and may continue to do so.  we may not be able to protect our source code from copying if there is an unauthorized disclosure.\u00a0source code, the detailed program commands for our operating systems and other software programs, is critical to our business. although we license portions of our application and operating system source code to several licensees, we take significant measures to protect the secrecy of large portions of our source code. if our source code leaks, we might lose future trade secret protection for that code. it may then become easier for third parties to compete with our products by copying functionality, which could adversely affect our revenue and operating margins. unauthorized disclosure of source code also could increase the security risks described in the next paragraph.  cyberattacks and security vulnerabilities could lead to reduced revenue, increased costs, liability claims, or harm to our reputation or competitive position.  security of our information technology  threats to it security can take a variety of forms. individual and groups of hackers and sophisticated organizations, including state-sponsored organizations or nation-states, continuously undertake attacks that pose threats to our customers and our it.\u00a0these actors may use a wide variety of methods, which may include developing and deploying malicious software or exploiting vulnerabilities in hardware, software, or other infrastructure in order to attack our products and services or gain access to our networks and datacenters, using social engineering techniques to induce our employees, users, partners, or customers to disclose passwords or other sensitive information or take other actions to gain access to our data or our users\u2019 or customers\u2019 data, or acting in a coordinated manner to launch distributed denial of service or other coordinated attacks. inadequate account security practices may also result in unauthorized access to confidential data. for example, system administrators may fail to timely remove employee account access when no longer appropriate. employees or third parties may intentionally compromise our or our users\u2019 security or systems, or reveal confidential information.  20part i item 1a \u00a0 cyberthreats are constantly evolving, increasing the difficulty of detecting and successfully defending against them. we may have no current capability to detect certain vulnerabilities, which may allow them to persist in the environment over long periods of time. cyberthreats can have cascading impacts that unfold with increasing speed across our internal networks and systems and those of our partners and customers. breaches of our facilities, network, or data security could disrupt the security of our systems and business applications, impair our ability to provide services to our customers and protect the privacy of their data, result in product development delays, compromise confidential or technical business information harming our reputation or competitive position, result in theft or misuse of our intellectual property or other assets, require us to allocate more resources to improved technologies, or otherwise adversely affect our business.  in addition, our internal it environment continues to evolve. often, we are early adopters of new devices and technologies. we embrace new ways of sharing data and communicating internally and with partners and customers using methods such as social networking and other consumer-oriented technologies. our business policies and internal security controls may not keep pace with these changes as new threats emerge.  security of our products, services, devices, and customers\u2019 data  the security of our products and services is important in our customers\u2019 decisions to purchase or use our products or services. security threats are a significant challenge to companies like us whose business is providing technology products and services to others. threats to our own it infrastructure can also affect our customers. customers using our cloud-based services rely on the security of our infrastructure, including hardware and other elements provided by third parties, to ensure the reliability of our services and the protection of their data. adversaries tend to focus their efforts on the most popular operating systems, programs, and services, including many of ours, and we expect that to continue. adversaries that acquire user account information at other companies can use that information to compromise our users\u2019 accounts where accounts share the same attributes like passwords. inadequate account security practices may also result in unauthorized access. we are also increasingly incorporating open source software into our products. there may be vulnerabilities in open source software that may make our products susceptible to cyberattacks.  to defend against security threats to our internal it systems, our cloud-based services, and our customers\u2019 systems, we must continuously engineer more secure products and services, enhance security and reliability features, improve the deployment of software updates to address security vulnerabilities in our own products as well as those provided by others, develop mitigation technologies that help to secure customers from attacks even when software updates are not deployed, maintain the digital security infrastructure that protects the integrity of our network, products, and services, and provide customers security tools such as firewalls and anti-virus software and information about the need to deploy security measures and the impact of doing so.  the cost of these steps could reduce our operating margins. if we fail to do these things well, actual or perceived security vulnerabilities in our products and services, data corruption issues, or reduced performance could harm our reputation and lead customers to reduce or delay future purchases of products or subscriptions to services, or to use competing products or services. customers may also spend more on protecting their existing computer systems from attack, which could delay adoption of additional products or services. customers may fail to update their systems, continue to run software or operating systems we no longer support, or may fail timely to install or enable security patches. any of these actions by customers could adversely affect our reputation and revenue. actual or perceived vulnerabilities may lead to claims against us. our license agreements typically contain provisions that eliminate or limit our exposure to liability, but there is no assurance these provisions will withstand legal challenges. at times, to achieve commercial objectives, we may enter into agreements with larger liability exposure to customers.  as illustrated by the recent spectre and meltdown threats, our products operate in conjunction with and are dependent on products and components across a broad ecosystem. if there is a security vulnerability in one of these components, and if there is a security exploit targeting it, we could face increased costs, liability claims, reduced revenue, or harm to our reputation or competitive position. 21part i item 1a \u00a0 disclosure and misuse of personal data could result in liability and harm our reputation.\u00a0as we continue to grow the number and scale of our cloud-based offerings, we store and process increasingly large amounts of personally identifiable information of our customers and users. the continued occurrence of high-profile data breaches provides evidence of an external environment increasingly hostile to information security. despite our efforts to improve the security controls across our business groups and geographies, it is possible our security controls over personal data, our training of employees and vendors on data security, and other practices we follow may not prevent the improper disclosure of customer or user data we or our vendors store and manage. in addition, third parties who have limited access to our customer or user data may use this data in unauthorized ways. improper disclosure or misuse could harm our reputation, lead to legal exposure to customers or users, or subject us to liability under laws that protect personal data, resulting in increased costs or loss of revenue. our software products and services also enable our customers and users to store and process personal data on-premises or, increasingly, in a cloud-based environment we host. government authorities can sometimes require us to produce customer or user data in response to valid legal orders. in the u.s. and elsewhere, we advocate for transparency concerning these requests and appropriate limitations on government authority to compel disclosure. despite our efforts to protect customer and user data, perceptions that the collection, use, and retention of personal information is not satisfactorily protected could inhibit sales of our products or services, and could limit adoption of our cloud-based solutions by consumers, businesses, and government entities. additional security measures we may take to address customer or user concerns, or constraints on our flexibility to determine where and how to operate datacenters in response to customer or user expectations or governmental rules or actions, may cause higher operating expenses or hinder growth of our products and services.  we may not be able to protect information in our products and services from use by others. linkedin and other microsoft products and services contain valuable information and content protected by contractual restrictions or technical measures. in certain cases, we have made commitments to our members and users to limit access to or use of this information. changes in the law or interpretations of the law may weaken our ability to prevent third parties from scraping or gathering information or content through use of bots or other measures and using it for their own benefit, thus diminishing the value of our products and services. abuse of our advertising or social platforms may harm our reputation or user engagement. for linkedin, bing ads, and other products and services that provide content or host ads that come from or can be influenced by third parties, our reputation or user engagement may be negatively affected by activity that is hostile or inappropriate to other people, by users impersonating other people or organizations, by use of our products or services to disseminate information that may be viewed as misleading or intended to manipulate the opinions of our users, or by the use of our products or services that violates our terms of service or otherwise for objectionable or illegal ends. preventing these actions may require us to make substantial investments in people and technology and these investments may not be successful, adversely affecting our business and financial results. we may have excessive outages, data losses, and disruptions of our online services if we fail to maintain an adequate operations infrastructure.\u00a0our increasing user traffic, growth in services, and the complexity of our products and services demand more computing power. we spend substantial amounts to build, purchase, or lease datacenters and equipment and to upgrade our technology and network infrastructure to handle more traffic on our websites and in our datacenters. these demands continue to increase as we introduce new products and services and support the growth of existing services such as bing, exchange online, azure, microsoft account services, office 365, onedrive, sharepoint online, skype, xbox live, outlook.com, and windows stores. we are rapidly growing our business of providing a platform and back-end hosting for services provided by third parties to their end users. maintaining, securing, and expanding this infrastructure is expensive and complex. it requires that we maintain an internet connectivity infrastructure that is robust and reliable within competitive and regulatory constraints that continue to evolve. inefficiencies or operational failures, including temporary or permanent loss of customer data or insufficient internet connectivity, could diminish the quality of our products, services, and user experience resulting in contractual liability, claims by customers and other third parties, regulatory actions, damage to our reputation, and loss of current and potential users, subscribers, and advertisers, each of which may harm our operating results and financial condition.  22part i item 1a \u00a0 government litigation and regulatory activity relating to competition rules may limit how we design and market our products.\u00a0as a leading global software and device maker, government agencies closely scrutinize us under u.s. and foreign competition laws. an increasing number of governments are actively enforcing competition laws and regulations and this includes increased scrutiny in potentially large markets such as the european union (\u201ceu\u201d), the u.s., and china. some jurisdictions also allow competitors or consumers to assert claims of anti-competitive conduct. u.s. federal and state antitrust authorities have previously brought enforcement actions and continue to scrutinize our business.  the european commission (\u201cthe commission\u201d) closely scrutinizes the design of high-volume microsoft products and the terms on which we make certain technologies used in these products, such as file formats, programming interfaces, and protocols, available to other companies. flagship product releases such as windows 10 can receive significant scrutiny under competition laws. for example, in 2004, the commission ordered us to create new versions of our windows operating system that do not include certain multimedia technologies and to provide our competitors with specifications for how to implement certain proprietary windows communications protocols in their own products. in 2009, the commission accepted a set of commitments we offered to address the commission\u2019s concerns relating to competition in web browsing software, including an undertaking to address commission concerns relating to interoperability. the web browsing commitments expired in 2014. the remaining obligations may limit our ability to innovate in windows or other products in the future, diminish the developer appeal of the windows platform, and increase our product development costs. the availability of licenses related to protocols and file formats may enable competitors to develop software products that better mimic the functionality of our products, which could hamper sales of our\u00a0products.  our portfolio of first-party devices continues to grow; at the same time our oem partners offer a large variety of devices on our platforms. as a result, increasingly we both cooperate and compete with our oem partners, creating a risk that we fail to do so in compliance with competition rules. regulatory scrutiny in this area may increase. certain foreign governments, particularly in china and other countries in asia, have advanced arguments under their competition laws that exert downward pressure on royalties for our intellectual property.  government regulatory actions and court decisions such as these may result in fines, or hinder our ability to provide the benefits of our software to consumers and businesses, reducing the attractiveness of our products and the revenue that come from them. new competition law actions could be initiated, potentially using previous actions as precedent. the outcome of such actions, or steps taken to avoid them, could adversely affect us in a variety of ways, including:          23part i item 1a \u00a0 our global operations subject us to potential liability under anti-corruption, trade protection, and other laws and regulations.\u00a0the foreign corrupt practices act and other anti-corruption laws and regulations (\u201canti-corruption laws\u201d) prohibit corrupt payments by our employees, vendors, or agents. from time to time, we receive inquiries from authorities in the u.s. and elsewhere and reports from employees and others about our business activities outside the u.s. and our compliance with anti-corruption laws. specifically, we have been cooperating with authorities in the u.s. in connection with reports concerning our compliance with the foreign corrupt practices act in various countries. most countries in which we operate also have competition laws that prohibit competitors from colluding or otherwise attempting to reduce competition between themselves. while we devote substantial resources to our global compliance programs and have implemented policies, training, and internal controls designed to reduce the risk of corrupt payments and collusive activity, our employees, vendors, or agents may violate our policies. our failure to comply with anti-corruption laws or competition laws could result in significant fines and penalties, criminal sanctions against us, our officers, or our employees, prohibitions on the conduct of our business, and damage to our reputation. operations outside the u.s. may be affected by changes in trade protection laws, policies, and measures, sanctions, and other regulatory requirements affecting trade and investment. we may be subject to legal liability and reputational damage if we sell goods or services in violation of u.s. trade sanctions on countries such as iran, north korea, cuba, sudan, and syria.  other regulatory areas that may apply to our products and online services offerings include user privacy, telecommunications, data storage and protection, and online content. for example, regulators may take the position that our offerings such as skype are covered by existing laws regulating telecommunications services and new laws may define more of our services as regulated telecommunications services. data protection authorities may assert that our collection, use, and management of customer data is inconsistent with their laws and regulations. legislative or regulatory action relating cybersecurity requirements may increase the costs to develop, implement, or secure our products and services. legislative or regulatory action could also emerge in the area of ai, increasing costs or restricting opportunity. applying these laws and regulations to our business is often unclear, subject to change over time, and sometimes may conflict from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. additionally, these laws and governments\u2019 approach to their enforcement, and our products and services, are continuing to evolve. compliance with these types of regulation may involve significant costs or require changes in products or business practices that result in reduced revenue. noncompliance could result in the imposition of penalties or orders we stop the alleged noncompliant activity.  we strive to empower all people and organizations to achieve more, and accessibility of our products is an important aspect of this goal. there is increasing pressure from advocacy groups, regulators, competitors, and customers to make technology more accessible. if our products do not meet customer expectations or emerging global accessibility requirements, we could lose sales opportunities or face regulatory actions laws and regulations relating to the handling of personal data may impede the adoption of our services or result in increased costs, legal claims, fines against us, or reputational damage.\u00a0the growth of our internet- and cloud-based services internationally relies increasingly on the movement of data across national boundaries. legal requirements relating to the collection, storage, handling, and transfer of personal data continue to evolve. for example, the eu and the u.s. formally entered into a new framework in july 2016 that provides a mechanism for companies to transfer data from eu member states to the u.s. this framework, called the privacy shield, is intended to address shortcomings identified by the european court of justice in a predecessor mechanism. the privacy shield and other mechanisms are currently subject to challenges in european courts, which may lead to uncertainty about the legal basis for data transfers across the atlantic. the privacy shield and other potential rules on the flow of data across borders could increase the cost and complexity of delivering our products and services in some markets. in may 2018, a new eu law governing data practices and privacy, the general data protection regulation (\u201cgdpr\u201d), became effective.\u00a0the law, which applies to all of our activities conducted from an establishment in the eu or related to products and services offered in the eu, imposes a range of new compliance obligations regarding the handling of personal data. engineering efforts to build new capabilities to facilitate compliance with the law have entailed substantial expense and the diversion of engineering resources from other projects and may continue to do so. we might experience reduced demand for our offerings if we are unable to engineer products that meet our legal duties or help our customers meet their obligations under the gdpr or other data regulations, or if the changes we implement to comply with the gdpr make our offerings less attractive. the gdpr imposes significant new obligations and compliance with these obligations depends in part on how particular regulators apply and interpret them. if we fail to comply with the gdpr, or if regulators assert we have failed to comply with the gdpr, it may lead to regulatory enforcement actions, which can result in monetary penalties of up to 4% of worldwide revenue, private lawsuits, or reputational damage. 24part i item 1a \u00a0 the company\u2019s investment in gaining insights from data is becoming central to the value of the services we deliver to customers, to our operational efficiency and key opportunities in monetization, customer perceptions of quality, and operational efficiency. our ability to use data in this way may be constrained by regulatory developments that impede realizing the expected return from this investment. ongoing legal reviews by regulators may result in burdensome or inconsistent requirements, including data sovereignty and localization requirements, affecting the location and movement of our customer and internal employee data as well as the management of that data. compliance with applicable laws and regulations regarding personal data may require changes in services, business practices, or internal systems that result in increased costs, lower revenue, reduced efficiency, or greater difficulty in competing with foreign-based firms. compliance with data regulations might limit our ability to innovate or offer certain features and functionality in some jurisdictions where we operate. failure to comply with existing or new rules may result in significant penalties or orders to stop the alleged noncompliant activity, as well as negative publicity and diversion of management time and effort. our business depends on our ability to attract and retain talented employees.\u00a0our business is based on successfully attracting and retaining talented employees. the market for highly skilled workers and leaders in our industry is extremely competitive. maintaining our brand and reputation are important to our ability to recruit and retain employees. we are also limited in our ability to recruit internationally by restrictive domestic immigration laws. changes to u.s. immigration policies that restrain the flow of technical and professional talent may inhibit our ability to adequately staff our research and development efforts. if we are less successful in our recruiting efforts, or if we cannot retain highly skilled workers and key leaders, our ability to develop and deliver successful products and services may be adversely affected. effective succession planning is also important to our long-term success. failure to ensure effective transfer of knowledge and smooth transitions involving key employees could hinder our strategic planning and execution. how employment-related laws are interpreted and applied to our workforce practices may result in increased operating costs and less flexibility in how we meet our workforce needs.  we have claims and lawsuits against us that may result in adverse outcomes.\u00a0we are subject to a variety of claims and lawsuits. these claims may arise from a wide variety of business practices and initiatives, including major new product releases such as windows 10, significant business transactions, warranty or product claims, and employment practices. adverse outcomes in some or all of these claims may result in significant monetary damages or injunctive relief that could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business. the litigation and other claims are subject to inherent uncertainties and management\u2019s view of these matters may change in the future. a material adverse impact in our consolidated financial statements could occur for the period in which the effect of an unfavorable outcome becomes probable and reasonably estimable.  we may have additional tax liabilities.\u00a0we are subject to income taxes in the u.s. and many foreign jurisdictions. significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes. in the course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. for example, compliance with the 2017 united states tax cut and jobs act (\u201ctcja\u201d) may require the collection of information not regularly produced within the company, the use of estimates in our financial statements, and the exercise of significant judgment in accounting for its provisions. as regulations and guidance evolve with respect to tcja, and as we gather more information and perform more analysis, our results may differ from previous estimates and may materially affect our financial position. we regularly are under audit by tax authorities in different jurisdictions. economic\u00a0and political\u00a0pressures to increase tax revenue in various jurisdictions may make resolving tax disputes favorably more difficult. although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation in the jurisdictions where we are subject to taxation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals. the results of an audit or litigation could have a material effect in our consolidated financial statements in the period or periods in which that determination is made.  we earn a significant amount of our operating income outside the u.s. a change in the mix of earnings and losses in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in our business or structure, or the expiration of or disputes about certain tax agreements in a particular country may result in higher effective tax rates for the company. in addition, changes in u.s. federal and state or international tax laws applicable to corporate multinationals, other fundamental law changes currently being considered by many countries, including in the u.s., and changes in taxing jurisdictions\u2019 administrative interpretations, decisions, policies, and positions may materially adversely impact our tax expense and cash flows.  25part i item 1a \u00a0 we may experience quality or supply problems.\u00a0our hardware products such as xbox consoles, surface devices, and other devices we design, manufacture, and market are highly complex and can have defects in design, manufacture, or associated software. we could incur significant expenses, lost revenue, and reputational harm as a result of recalls, safety alerts, or product liability claims if we fail to prevent, detect, or address such issues through design, testing, or warranty repairs. our software products also may experience quality or reliability problems. the highly-sophisticated software products we develop may contain bugs and other defects that interfere with their intended operation. any defects we do not detect and fix in pre-release testing could cause reduced sales and revenue, damage to our reputation, repair or remediation costs, delays in the release of new products or versions, or legal liability. although our license agreements typically contain provisions that eliminate or limit our exposure to liability, there is no assurance these provisions will withstand legal challenge. we acquire some device and datacenter components from sole suppliers. our competitors use some of the same suppliers and their demand for hardware components can affect the capacity available to us. if a component from a sole-source supplier is delayed or becomes unavailable, whether because of supplier capacity constraint, industry shortages, legal or regulatory changes, or other reasons, we may not obtain timely replacement supplies, resulting in reduced sales or inadequate datacenter capacity. component shortages, excess or obsolete inventory, or price reductions resulting in inventory adjustments may increase our cost of revenue. xbox consoles, surface devices, datacenter servers, and other hardware are assembled in asia and other geographies that may be subject to disruptions in the supply chain, resulting in shortages that would affect our revenue and operating margins. these same risks would apply to any other hardware and software products we may offer.  our global business exposes us to operational and economic risks.\u00a0our customers are located in over 200 countries and a significant part of our revenue comes from international sales. the global nature of our business creates operational and economic risks. our results of operations may be affected by global, regional, and local economic developments, monetary policy, inflation, and recession, as well as political and military disputes. in addition, our international growth strategy includes certain markets, the developing nature of which presents several risks, including deterioration of social, political, labor, or economic conditions in a country or region, and difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations. emerging nationalist trends in specific countries may significantly alter the trade environment. changes to trade policy or agreements as a result of populism, protectionism, or economic nationalism may result in higher tariffs, local sourcing initiatives, or other developments that make it more difficult to sell our products in foreign countries. disruptions of these kinds in developed or emerging markets could negatively impact demand for our products and services or increase operating costs. although we hedge a portion of our international currency exposure, significant fluctuations in foreign exchange rates between the u.s. dollar and foreign currencies may adversely affect our revenue.  catastrophic events or geopolitical conditions may disrupt our business.\u00a0a disruption or failure of our systems or operations because of a major earthquake, weather event, cyberattack, terrorist attack, or other catastrophic event could cause delays in completing sales, providing services, or performing other critical functions. our corporate headquarters, a significant portion of our research and development activities, and certain other essential business operations are in the seattle, washington area, and we have other business operations in the silicon valley area of california, both of which are seismically active regions. a catastrophic event that results in the destruction or disruption of any of our critical business or it systems could harm our ability to conduct normal business operations. providing our customers with more services and solutions in the cloud puts a premium on the resilience of our systems and strength of our business continuity management plans, and magnifies the potential impact of prolonged service outages on our operating results.  26part i item 1a \u00a0 abrupt political change, terrorist activity, and armed conflict pose a risk of general economic disruption in affected countries, which may increase our operating costs. these conditions also may add uncertainty to the timing and budget for technology investment decisions by our customers, and may cause supply chain disruptions for hardware manufacturers. geopolitical change may result in changing regulatory requirements that could impact our operating strategies, access to global markets, hiring, and profitability. geopolitical instability may lead to sanctions and impact our ability to do business in some markets or with some public-sector customers. any of these changes may negatively impact our revenues.  the long-term effects of climate change on the global economy or the it industry in particular are unclear. environmental regulations or changes in the supply, demand or available sources of energy or other natural resources may affect the availability or cost of goods and services, including natural resources, necessary to run our business. changes in weather where we operate may increase the costs of powering and cooling computer hardware we use to develop software and provide cloud-based services.  adverse economic or market conditions may harm our business.\u00a0worsening economic conditions, including inflation, recession, or other changes in economic conditions, may cause lower it spending and adversely affect our revenue. if demand for pcs, servers, and other computing devices declines, or consumer or business spending for those products declines, our revenue will be adversely affected. substantial revenue comes from our u.s. government contracts. an extended federal government shutdown resulting from failing to pass budget appropriations, adopt continuing funding resolutions or raise the debt ceiling, and other budgetary decisions limiting or delaying federal government spending, could reduce government it spending on our products and services and adversely affect our revenue.  our product distribution system relies on an extensive partner and retail network. oems building devices that run our software have also been a significant means of distribution. the impact of economic conditions on our partners, such as the bankruptcy of a major distributor, oem, or retailer, could cause sales channel disruption.  challenging economic conditions also may impair the ability of our customers to pay for products and services they have purchased. as a result, allowances for doubtful accounts and write-offs of accounts receivable may increase.  we maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings, types, and maturities. these investments are subject to general credit, liquidity, market, and interest rate risks, which may be exacerbated by market downturns or events that affect global financial markets. a significant part of our investment portfolio comprises u.s. government securities. if global financial markets decline for long periods, or if there is a downgrade of the u.s. government credit rating due to an actual or threatened default on government debt, our investment portfolio may be adversely affected and we could determine that more of our investments have experienced an other-than-temporary decline in fair value, requiring impairment charges that could adversely affect our financial results.  changes in our sales organization may impact revenues. in july 2017, we announced plans to reorganize our global sales organization to help enable customers\u2019 digital transformation, add greater technical ability to our sales force, and create pooled resources that can be used across countries and industries. the reorganization is the most significant change in our global sales organization in our history, involving employees changing roles, adding additional talent, realigning teams, and onboarding new partners. successfully executing these changes will be a significant factor in enabling future revenue growth. as we continue to navigate through this transition, sales, profitability, and cash flow could be adversely impacted. the development of the internet of things presents security, privacy, and execution risks. to support the growth of the intelligent cloud and the intelligent edge, we are developing products, services, and technologies to power the iot, a network of distributed and interconnected devices employing sensors, data, and computing capabilities including ai. the iot\u2019s great potential also carries substantial risks. iot products and services may contain defects in design, manufacture, or operation, that make them insecure or ineffective for their intended purposes. an iot solution has multiple layers of hardware, sensors, processors, software, and firmware, several of which we may not develop or control. each layer, including the weakest layer, can impact the security of the whole system. many iot devices have limited interfaces and ability to be updated or patched. iot solutions may collect large amounts of data, and our handling of iot data may not satisfy customers or regulatory requirements. iot scenarios may increasingly affect personal health and safety. if iot solutions that include our technologies do not work as intended, violate the law, or harm individuals or businesses, we may be subject to legal claims or enforcement actions. these risks, if realized, may increase our costs, damage our reputation or brands, or negatively impact our revenues or margins.\u00a0\u00a0 27part i item 1a \u00a0 issues in the use of artificial intelligence in our offerings may result in reputational harm or liability. we are building ai into many of our offerings and we expect this element of our business to grow. we envision a future in which ai operating in our devices, applications, and the cloud helps our customers be more productive in their work and personal lives. as with many disruptive innovations, ai presents risks and challenges that could affect its adoption, and therefore our business. ai algorithms may be flawed. datasets may be insufficient or contain biased information. inappropriate or controversial data practices by microsoft or others could impair the acceptance of ai solutions. these deficiencies could undermine the decisions, predictions, or analysis ai applications produce, subjecting us to competitive harm, legal liability, and brand or reputational harm. some ai scenarios present ethical issues. if we enable or offer ai solutions that are controversial because of their impact on human rights, privacy, employment, or other social issues, we may experience brand or reputational harm.\u00a0\u00a0 if our reputation or our brands are damaged, our business and operating results may be harmed. our reputation and brands are globally recognized and are important to our business. our reputation and brands affect our ability to attract and retain consumer, business, and public-sector customers. there are numerous ways our reputation or brands could be damaged. these include product safety or quality issues, or our environmental impact, supply chain practices, or human rights record. we may experience backlash from customers, government entities, advocacy groups, employees, and other stakeholders that disagree with our product offering decisions or public policy positions. damage to our reputation or our brands may occur from, among other things:        the proliferation of social media may increase the likelihood, speed, and magnitude of negative brand events. if our brands or reputation are damaged, it could negatively impact our revenues or margins, or ability to attract the most highly qualified employees. \u00a0 \u00a0 28part ii item 7 \u00a0 industry trends  our industry is dynamic and highly competitive, with frequent changes in both technologies and business models. each industry shift is an opportunity to conceive new products, new technologies, or new ideas that can further transform the industry and our business. at microsoft, we push the boundaries of what is possible through a broad range of research and development activities that seek to identify and address the changing demands of customers and users, industry trends, and competitive forces.  economic conditions, challenges, and risks  the markets for software, devices, and cloud-based services are dynamic and highly competitive. our competitors are developing new software and devices, while also deploying competing cloud-based services for consumers and businesses. the devices and form factors customers prefer evolve rapidly, and influence how users access services in the cloud, and in some cases, the user\u2019s choice of which suite of cloud-based services to use. we must continue to evolve and adapt over an extended time in pace with this changing environment. the investments we are making in infrastructure and devices will continue to increase our operating costs and may decrease our operating margins.  our success is highly dependent on our ability to attract and retain qualified employees. we hire a mix of university and industry talent worldwide. we compete for talented individuals globally by offering an exceptional working environment, broad customer reach, scale in resources, the ability to grow one\u2019s career across many different products and businesses, and competitive compensation and benefits. aggregate demand for our software, services, and devices is correlated to global macroeconomic and geopolitical factors, which remain dynamic.  our international operations provide a significant portion of our total revenue and expenses. many of these revenue and expenses are denominated in currencies other than the u.s. dollar. as a result, changes in foreign exchange rates may significantly affect revenue and expenses. strengthening of the u.s. dollar relative to certain foreign currencies throughout fiscal year 2017 negatively impacted reported revenue and reduced reported expenses from our international operations. this trend reversed in fiscal year 2018. strengthening of foreign currencies relative to the u.s. dollar positively impacted reported revenue and increased reported expenses from our international operations. refer to risk factors (part i, item\u00a01a of this form 10-k) for a discussion of these factors and other risks.  seasonality  we expect our revenue to fluctuate quarterly and to be higher in the second and fourth quarters of our fiscal year. second quarter revenue is driven by corporate year-end spending trends in our major markets and holiday season spending by consumers, and fourth quarter revenue is driven by the volume of multi-year on-premises contracts executed during the period.  reportable segments  we report our financial performance based on the following segments: productivity and business processes, intelligent cloud, and more personal computing. the segment amounts included in md&a are presented on a basis consistent with our internal management reporting. all differences between our internal management reporting basis and accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america (\u201cgaap\u201d), along with certain corporate-level and other activity, are included in corporate and other. additional information on our reportable segments is contained in note 21 \u2013 segment information and geographic data of the notes to financial statements (part ii, item\u00a08 of this form 10-k). 33part ii item 7 \u00a0 summary results of operations \u00a0   consolidated results of operations include linkedin results since the date of acquisition on december 8, 2016. fiscal year 2018 includes a full period of linkedin results, whereas fiscal year 2017 only includes results from the date of acquisition. adjusted operating income, net income, and adjusted diluted earnings per share (\u201ceps\u201d) exclude the net charge related to the tcja, and impairment and restructuring expenses. refer to the non-gaap financial measures section below for a reconciliation of our financial results reported in accordance with gaap to non-gaap financial results. fiscal year 2018 compared with fiscal year 2017 revenue increased $13.8 billion or 14%, driven by growth across each of our segments. productivity and business processes revenue increased, driven by linkedin and higher revenue from office. intelligent cloud revenue increased, primarily due to higher revenue from server products and cloud services. more personal computing revenue increased, driven by higher revenue from gaming, windows, search advertising, and surface, offset in part by lower revenue from phone.  gross margin increased $9.7 billion or 16%, due to growth across each of our segments. gross margin percentage increased slightly, driven by favorable segment sales mix and gross margin percentage improvement in more personal computing. gross margin included a 7 percentage point improvement in commercial cloud, primarily from azure. operating income increased $6.0 billion or 21%, driven by growth across each of our segments. linkedin operating loss increased $63 million to $987 million, including $1.5 billion of amortization of intangible assets. operating income included a favorable foreign currency impact of 2%. key changes in expenses were:         current year net income and diluted eps were negatively impacted by the net charge related to tcja, which resulted in a decrease to net income and diluted earnings per share of $13.7 billion and $1.75, respectively. prior year diluted eps was negatively impacted by restructuring expenses, which resulted in a decrease in operating income, net income, and diluted eps of $306 million, $243 million, and $0.04, respectively.  34part ii item 7 \u00a0 fiscal year 2017 compared with fiscal year 2016  revenue increased $5.4 billion or 6%, driven by growth in productivity and business processes and intelligent cloud, offset in part by lower revenue from more personal computing. productivity and business processes revenue increased, driven by the acquisition of linkedin and higher revenue from microsoft office. intelligent cloud revenue increased, primarily due to higher revenue from server products and cloud services. more personal computing revenue decreased, mainly due to lower revenue from devices, offset in part by higher revenue from windows and search advertising.  gross margin increased $3.9 billion or 7%, due to growth across each of our segments, including the acquisition of linkedin, driven by higher revenue. gross margin percentage increased slightly due to a margin percent increase in more personal computing and segment sales mix, offset in part by margin percent declines in productivity and business processes and intelligent cloud. gross margin percentage includes a 5 percentage point improvement in commercial cloud gross margin primarily across azure and office 365. operating income increased $2.9 billion or 11%, primarily due to higher gross margin and lower impairment and restructuring expenses, offset in part by an increase in research and development and sales and marketing expenses. operating income included an operating loss of $924 million related to the acquisition of linkedin, including $866 million of amortization of intangible assets. operating income also included an unfavorable foreign currency impact of 3%. key changes in expenses were:          diluted eps was $3.25 for fiscal year 2017, and was negatively impacted by restructuring expenses, which resulted in a decrease of $0.04. diluted eps was $2.56 for fiscal year 2016, and was negatively impacted by impairment and restructuring expenses, which resulted in a decrease of $0.11. segment results of operations  \u00a0     35part ii item 7 \u00a0 reportable segments

with fiscal year 2016  productivity and business processes  revenue increased $4.1 billion or 16%.         operating income decreased $367 million or 3%, including an unfavorable foreign currency impact of 2%.      intelligent cloud  revenue increased $2.5 billion or 10%.      37part ii item 7 \u00a0 operating income decreased $122 million or 1%, including an unfavorable foreign currency impact of 2%.      more personal computing  revenue decreased $1.1 billion or 3%.            operating income increased $2.6 billion or 43%, including an unfavorable foreign currency impact of 3%.      corporate and other  corporate and other operating loss is comprised of corporate-level activity not specifically allocated to a segment, including impairment and restructuring expenses. fiscal year 2018 compared with fiscal year 2017  corporate and other operating loss decreased $306 million, due to a reduction in impairment and restructuring expenses, driven by employee severance expenses primarily related to our sales and marketing restructuring plan in fiscal year 2017. 38part ii item 7 \u00a0 fiscal year 2017 compared with fiscal year 2016  corporate and other operating loss decreased $804 million, primarily due to a reduction in impairment and restructuring expenses, driven by asset impairment charges and restructuring charges related to our phone business in fiscal year 2016, offset in part by employee severance expenses primarily related to our sales and marketing restructuring plan in fiscal year 2017. operating expenses research and development  \u00a0   research and development expenses include payroll, employee benefits, stock-based compensation expense, and other headcount-related expenses associated with product development. research and development expenses also include third-party development and programming costs, localization costs incurred to translate software for international markets, and the amortization of purchased software code and services content.  fiscal year 2018 compared with fiscal year 2017 research and development expenses increased $1.7 billion or 13%, primarily due to investments in cloud engineering and linkedin expenses. linkedin expenses increased $762 million to $1.5 billion. fiscal year 2017 compared with fiscal year 2016  research and development expenses increased $1.0 billion or 9%, primarily due to linkedin expenses and increased investments in cloud engineering, offset in part by a reduction in phone expenses. expenses included $745 million related to our acquisition of linkedin. sales and marketing  \u00a0   sales and marketing expenses include payroll, employee benefits, stock-based compensation expense, and other headcount-related expenses associated with sales and marketing personnel, and the costs of advertising, promotions, trade shows, seminars, and other programs.  fiscal year 2018 compared with fiscal year 2017  sales and marketing expenses increased $2.0 billion or 13%, primarily due to linkedin expenses and investments in commercial sales capacity, offset in part by a decrease in windows marketing expenses. linkedin expenses increased $1.2 billion to $2.5 billion, including $617 million of amortization of acquired intangible assets.  fiscal year 2017 compared with fiscal year 2016  sales and marketing expenses increased $826 million or 6%, primarily due to linkedin expenses and increased investments in sales capacity for our commercial cloud, offset in part by a reduction in phone expenses and prior year marketing expenses primarily related to surface, commercial, and windows 10. expenses included $1.2 billion related to our acquisition of linkedin, including $359 million of amortization of acquired intangible assets.  39part ii item 7 \u00a0 general and administrative  \u00a0   \u00a0 general and administrative expenses include payroll, employee benefits, stock-based compensation expense, severance expense, and other headcount-related expenses associated with finance, legal, facilities, certain human resources and other administrative personnel, certain taxes, and legal and other administrative fees.  fiscal year 2018 compared with fiscal year 2017 general and administrative expenses increased $273 million or 6%, primarily due to linkedin expenses. linkedin expenses increased $234 million to $528 million. fiscal year 2017 compared with fiscal year 2016 general and administrative expenses decreased $82 million or 2%, primarily due to prior year investments in infrastructure supporting our business transformation, a reduction in phone expenses, and lower employee-related expenses, offset in part by linkedin expenses. expenses included $294 million related to our acquisition of linkedin. impairment and restructuring expenses impairment and restructuring expenses include costs associated with the impairment of intangible assets related to our phone business, and employee severance expenses and other costs associated with the consolidation of facilities and manufacturing operations related to restructuring activities. fiscal year 2018 compared with fiscal year 2017  during fiscal year 2017, we recorded $306 million of employee severance expenses primarily related to our sales and marketing restructuring plan.  fiscal year 2017 compared with fiscal year 2016  impairment and restructuring expenses were $306 million for fiscal year 2017, compared to $1.1 billion for fiscal year 2016.  during fiscal year 2016, we recorded $630 million of asset impairment charges related to our phone business. we also recorded $480 million of restructuring charges, including employee severance expenses and contract termination costs, primarily related to our previously announced phone business restructuring plans.  other income (expense), net  the components of other income (expense), net were as follows:  \u00a0   40part ii item 7 \u00a0 we use derivative instruments to: manage risks related to foreign currencies, equity prices, interest rates, and credit; enhance investment returns; and facilitate portfolio diversification. gains and losses from changes in fair values of derivatives that are not designated as hedges are primarily recognized in other income (expense), net.  fiscal year 2018 compared with fiscal year 2017 dividends and interest income increased primarily due to higher average portfolio balances and yields on fixed-income securities. interest expense increased primarily due to higher average outstanding long-term debt and higher finance lease expense. net recognized gains on investments decreased primarily due to higher losses on sales of fixed-income securities, offset in part by higher gains on sales of equity securities. net losses on derivatives decreased primarily due to lower losses on equity, foreign exchange, and commodity derivatives, offset in part by losses on interest rate derivatives in the current period as compared to gains in the prior period.  fiscal year 2017 compared with fiscal year 2016  dividends and interest income increased primarily due to higher portfolio balances and yields on fixed-income securities. interest expense increased primarily due to higher outstanding long-term debt. net recognized gains on investments increased primarily due to higher gains on sales of equity securities. net losses on derivatives increased due to higher losses on equity derivatives, offset in part by lower losses on commodity and foreign currency derivatives. other, net reflects recognized losses from certain joint ventures and divestitures.  income taxes  effective tax rate fiscal year 2018 compared with fiscal year 2017  our effective tax rate for fiscal years 2018 and 2017 was 55% and 15%, respectively.\u00a0the increase in our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2018 compared to fiscal year 2017 was primarily due to the net charge related to the enactment of the tcja in fiscal year 2018 and the realization of tax benefits attributable to previous phone business losses in fiscal year 2017. our effective tax rate was higher than the u.s. federal statutory rate primarily due to the net charge related to the enactment of the tcja, offset in part by earnings taxed at lower rates in foreign jurisdictions resulting from our foreign regional operations centers in ireland, singapore, and puerto rico.  the mix of income before income taxes between the u.s. and foreign countries impacted our effective tax rate as a result of the geographic distribution of, and customer demand for, our products and services. in fiscal year 2018, our u.s. income before income taxes was $11.5 billion and our foreign income before income taxes was $24.9 billion. in fiscal year 2017, our u.s. income before income taxes was $6.8 billion and our foreign income before income taxes was $23.1 billion.  fiscal year 2017 compared with fiscal year 2016  our effective tax rate for fiscal years 2017 and 2016 was 15% and 20%, respectively.\u00a0the decrease in our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2017 compared to fiscal year 2016 was primarily due to the realization of tax benefits attributable to previous phone business losses, offset in part by changes in the mix of our income before income taxes between the u.s. and foreign countries. our effective tax rate was lower than the u.s. federal statutory rate primarily due to earnings taxed at lower rates in foreign jurisdictions resulting from our foreign regional operations centers in ireland, singapore, and puerto rico.  the mix of income before income taxes between the u.s. and foreign countries impacted our effective tax rate as a result of the geographic distribution of, and customer demand for, our products and services. in fiscal year 2017, our u.s. income before income taxes was $6.8 billion and our foreign income before income taxes was $23.1 billion. in fiscal year 2016, our u.s. income before income taxes was $5.1 billion and our foreign income before income taxes was $20.5 billion.  41part ii item 7 \u00a0 recent tax legislation  on december 22, 2017, the tcja was enacted into law, which significantly changes existing u.s. tax law and includes numerous provisions that affect our business, such as imposing a one-time transition tax on deemed repatriation of deferred foreign income, reducing the u.s. federal statutory tax rate, and adopting a territorial tax system. the tcja required us to incur a one-time transition tax on deferred foreign income not previously subject to u.s. income tax at a rate of 15.5% for foreign cash and certain other net current assets, and 8% on the remaining income. the tcja also reduced the u.s. federal statutory tax rate from 35% to 21% effective january 1, 2018. for fiscal year 2018, our blended u.s. federal statutory tax rate is 28.1%. this is the result of using the tax rate of 35% for the first and second quarter of fiscal year 2018 and the reduced tax rate of 21% for the third and fourth quarter of fiscal year 2018. the tcja includes a provision to tax global intangible low-taxed income (\u201cgilti\u201d) of foreign subsidiaries and a base erosion anti-abuse tax (\u201cbeat\u201d) measure that taxes certain payments between a u.s. corporation and its foreign subsidiaries. the gilti and beat provisions of the tcja will be effective for us beginning july 1, 2018. the tcja was effective in the second quarter of fiscal year 2018. as of june 30, 2018, we have not completed our accounting for the estimated tax effects of the tcja. during fiscal year 2018, we recorded a provisional net charge of $13.7 billion related to the tcja based on reasonable estimates for those tax effects. due to the timing of the enactment and the complexity in applying the provisions of the tcja, the provisional net charge is subject to revisions as we continue to complete our analysis of the tcja, collect and prepare necessary data, and interpret any additional guidance issued by the u.s. treasury department, internal revenue service (\u201cirs\u201d), financial accounting standards board, and other standard-setting and regulatory bodies. adjustments may materially impact our provision for income taxes and effective tax rate in the period in which the adjustments are made. our accounting for the estimated tax effects of the tcja will be completed during the measurement period, which is not expected to extend beyond one year from the enactment date.  during fiscal year 2018, we recorded an estimated net charge of $13.7 billion related to the tcja, due to the impact of the one-time transition tax on the deemed repatriation of deferred foreign income of $17.9 billion, offset in part by the impact of changes in the tax rate of $4.2 billion, primarily on deferred tax assets and liabilities. uncertain tax positions while we settled a portion of the irs audit for tax years 2004 to 2006 during the third quarter of fiscal year 2011, and a portion of the irs audit for tax years 2007 to 2009 during the first quarter of fiscal year 2016, we remain under audit for those years. in the second quarter of fiscal year 2018, we settled a portion of the irs audit for tax years 2010 to 2013. we continue to be subject to examination by the irs for tax years 2010 to 2017. in february 2012, the irs withdrew its 2011 revenue agents report for tax years 2004 to 2006 and reopened the audit phase of the examination. as of june 30, 2018, the primary unresolved issue relates to transfer pricing, which could have a significant impact in our consolidated financial statements if not resolved favorably. we believe our allowances for income tax contingencies are adequate. we have not received a proposed assessment for the unresolved issues and do not expect a final resolution of these issues in the next 12 months.\u00a0based on the information currently available, we do not anticipate a significant increase or decrease to our tax contingencies for these issues within the next 12 months. we are subject to income tax in many jurisdictions outside the u.s. our operations in certain jurisdictions remain subject to examination for tax years 1996 to 2017, some of which are currently under audit by local tax authorities. the resolution of each of these audits is not expected to be material to our consolidated financial statements. non-gaap financial measures adjusted operating income, net income and diluted earnings per share are non-gaap financial measures which exclude the net charge related to the tcja, and impairment and restructuring expenses. we believe these non-gaap measures aid investors by providing additional insight into our operational performance and help clarify trends affecting our business. for comparability of reporting, management considers non-gaap measures in conjunction with gaap financial results in evaluating business performance. these non-gaap financial measures presented should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, the measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with gaap. 42part ii item 7 \u00a0 the following table reconciles our financial results reported in accordance with gaap to non-gaap financial results: \u00a0   \u00a0 financial condition  cash, cash equivalents, and investments  cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments totaled $133.8 billion and $133.0 billion as of june 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively. equity and other investments were $1.9 billion and $6.0 billion as of june 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively. our short-term investments are primarily intended to facilitate liquidity and capital preservation. they consist predominantly of highly liquid investment-grade fixed-income securities, diversified among industries and individual issuers. the investments are predominantly u.s. dollar-denominated securities, but also include foreign currency-denominated securities to diversify risk. our fixed-income investments are exposed to interest rate risk and credit risk. the credit risk and average maturity of our fixed-income portfolio are managed to achieve economic returns that correlate to certain fixed-income indices. the settlement risk related to these investments is insignificant given that the short-term investments held are primarily highly liquid investment-grade fixed-income securities.  as a result of the tcja, our cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments held by foreign subsidiaries are no longer subject to u.s. tax on repatriation into the u.s. valuation  in general, and where applicable, we use quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities to determine the fair value of our financial instruments. this pricing methodology applies to our level 1 investments, such as u.s. government securities, common and preferred stock, and mutual funds. if quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities are not available to determine fair value, then we use quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities or inputs other than the quoted prices that are observable either directly or indirectly. this pricing methodology applies to our level 2 investments such as corporate notes and bonds, foreign government bonds, mortgage- and asset-backed securities, commercial paper, certificates of deposit, and u.s. agency securities. level 3 investments are valued using internally developed models with unobservable inputs. assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis using unobservable inputs are an immaterial portion of our portfolio.  43part ii item 7 \u00a0 a majority of our investments are priced by pricing vendors and are generally level 1 or level 2 investments as these vendors either provide a quoted market price in an active market or use observable inputs for their pricing without applying significant adjustments. broker pricing is used mainly when a quoted price is not available, the investment is not priced by our pricing vendors, or when a broker price is more reflective of fair values in the market in which the investment trades. our broker-priced investments are generally classified as level 2 investments because the broker prices these investments based on similar assets without applying significant adjustments. in addition, all our broker-priced investments have a sufficient level of trading volume to demonstrate that the fair values used are appropriate for these investments. our fair value processes include controls that are designed to ensure appropriate fair values are recorded. these controls include model validation, review of key model inputs, analysis of period-over-period fluctuations, and independent recalculation of prices where appropriate.  cash flows  fiscal year 2018 compared with fiscal year 2017  cash from operations increased $4.4 billion to $43.9 billion for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2018, mainly due to an increase in cash received from customers, offset in part by an increase in cash paid to employees, net cash paid for income taxes, cash paid for interest on debt, and cash paid to suppliers. cash used in financing was $33.6 billion for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2018, compared to cash from financing of $8.4 billion for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2017. the change was mainly due to a $41.7 billion decrease in proceeds from issuance of debt, net of repayments, offset in part by a $1.1 billion decrease in cash used for common stock repurchases. cash used in investing decreased $40.7 billion to $6.1 billion for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2018, mainly due to a $25.1 billion decrease in cash used for acquisitions of companies, net of cash acquired, and purchases of intangible and other assets, and a $19.1 billion increase in cash from net investment purchases, sales, and maturities. fiscal year 2017 compared with fiscal year 2016  cash from operations increased $6.2 billion to $39.5 billion during the fiscal year, mainly due to an increase in cash received from customers and an income tax refund for overpayment of estimated taxes, offset in part by an increase in cash paid to employees. cash from financing increased $16.8 billion to $8.4 billion, mainly due to a $13.2 billion increase in proceeds from issuances of debt, net of repayments, and a $4.2 billion decrease in cash used for common stock repurchases, offset in part by an $839 million increase in dividends paid. cash used in investing increased $22.8 billion to $46.8 billion, mainly due to a $24.6 billion increase in cash used for acquisitions of companies, net of cash acquired, and purchases of intangibles and other assets, offset in part by a $1.9 billion decrease in cash used for net investment purchases, sales, and maturities.\u00a0\u00a0 debt  we issued debt to take advantage of favorable pricing and liquidity in the debt markets, reflecting our credit rating and the low interest rate environment. the proceeds of these issuances were or will be used for general corporate purposes, which may include, among other things, funding for working capital, capital expenditures, repurchases of capital stock, acquisitions, and repayment of existing debt. refer to note 12 \u2013 debt of the notes to financial statements (part ii, item\u00a08 of this form 10-k) for further discussion. unearned revenue  unearned revenue comprises mainly unearned revenue related to volume licensing programs and includes software assurance (\u201csa\u201d) and cloud services. unearned revenue is generally billed upfront at the beginning of each annual coverage period for multi-year agreements and recognized ratably over the coverage period. unearned revenue also includes payments for other offerings for which we have been paid in advance and earn the revenue when we transfer control of the product or service. refer to note 1 \u2013 accounting policies of the notes to financial statements (part ii, item\u00a08 of this form 10-k) for further discussion. 44part ii item 7 \u00a0 the following table outlines the expected future recognition of unearned revenue as of june 30, 2018:  \u00a0   if our customers choose to license cloud-based versions of our products and services rather than licensing transaction-based products and services, the associated revenue will shift from being recognized at the time of the transaction to being recognized over the subscription period or upon consumption, as applicable.  share repurchases  for the fiscal years ended june 30, 2018, 2017, and 2016, we repurchased 99 million shares, 170 million shares, and 294 million shares of our common stock for $8.6 billion, $10.3 billion, and $14.8 billion, respectively, through our share repurchase programs. all repurchases were made using cash resources. refer to note 18 \u2013 stockholders\u2019 equity of the notes to financial statements (part ii, item\u00a08 of this form 10-k) for further discussion. dividends  refer to note 18 \u2013 stockholders\u2019 equity of the notes to financial statements (part ii, item\u00a08 of this form 10-k) for further discussion. off-balance sheet arrangements  we provide indemnifications of varying scope and size to certain customers against claims of intellectual property infringement made by third parties arising from the use of our products and certain other matters. additionally, we have agreed to cover damages resulting from breaches of certain security and privacy commitments in our cloud business. in evaluating estimated losses on these obligations, we consider factors such as the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and our ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss. these obligations did not have a material impact in our consolidated financial statements during the periods presented.  contractual obligations  the following table summarizes the payments due by fiscal year for our outstanding contractual obligations as of june 30, 2018:  \u00a0       45part ii item 7 \u00a0         other planned uses of capital  we will continue to invest in sales, marketing, product support infrastructure, and existing and advanced areas of technology, as well as continue making acquisitions that align with our business strategy. additions to property and equipment will continue, including new facilities, datacenters, and computer systems for research and development, sales and marketing, support, and administrative staff. we expect capital expenditures to increase in coming years to support growth in our cloud offerings. we have operating and finance leases for datacenters, corporate offices, research and development facilities, retail stores, and certain equipment. we have not engaged in any related party transactions or arrangements with unconsolidated entities or other persons that are reasonably likely to materially affect liquidity or the availability of capital resources.  liquidity  as a result of the tcja, we are required to pay a one-time transition tax of $17.9 billion on deferred foreign income not previously subject to u.s. income tax. in fiscal year 2018, we paid transition tax of $228 million. under the tcja, the remaining transition tax of $17.6 billion is payable interest-free over eight years, with 8% due in each of the first five years, 15% in year six, 20% in year seven, and 25% in year eight.  we expect existing cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, cash flows from operations, and access to capital markets to continue to be sufficient to fund our operating activities and cash commitments for investing and financing activities, such as dividends, share repurchases, debt maturities, material capital expenditures, and the transition tax related to the tcja, for at least the next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future.  recent accounting guidance  refer to note 1 \u2013 accounting policies of the notes to financial statements (part ii, item\u00a08 of this form 10-k) for further discussion. application of critical accounting policies  our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with gaap. preparing consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. these estimates and assumptions are affected by management\u2019s application of accounting policies. critical accounting policies for us include revenue recognition, impairment of investment securities, goodwill, research and development costs, contingencies, income taxes, and inventories.  revenue recognition  our contracts with customers often include promises to transfer multiple products and services to a customer. determining whether products and services are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately versus together may require significant judgment. when a cloud-based service includes both on-premises software licenses and cloud services, judgment is required to determine whether the software license is considered distinct and accounted for separately, or not distinct and accounted for together with the cloud service and recognized over time. certain cloud services, primarily office 365, depend on a significant level of integration, interdependency, and interrelation between the desktop applications and cloud services, and are accounted for together as one performance obligation. revenue from office 365 is recognized ratably over the period in which the cloud services are provided.  46part ii item 7 \u00a0 judgment is required to determine the stand-alone selling price (\u201cssp\") for each distinct performance obligation. we use a single amount to estimate ssp for items that are not sold separately, including on-premises licenses sold with sa or software updates provided at no additional charge. we use a range of amounts to estimate ssp when we sell each of the products and services separately and need to determine whether there is a discount to be allocated based on the relative ssp of the various products and services.\u00a0\u00a0 in instances where ssp is not directly observable, such as when we do not sell the product or service separately, we determine the ssp using information that may include market conditions and other observable inputs. we typically have more than one ssp for individual products and services due to the stratification of those products and services by customers and circumstances. in these instances, we may use information such as the size of the customer and geographic region in determining the ssp.\u00a0\u00a0 due to the various benefits from and the nature of our sa program, judgment is required to assess the pattern of delivery, including the exercise pattern of certain benefits across our portfolio of customers.\u00a0\u00a0 our products are generally sold with a right of return, we may provide other credits or incentives, and in certain instances we estimate customer usage of our products and services, which are accounted for as variable consideration when determining the amount of revenue to recognize. returns and credits are estimated at contract inception and updated at the end of each reporting period if additional information becomes available. changes to our estimated variable consideration were not material for the periods presented. the new standard related to revenue recognition had a material impact in our consolidated financial statements. refer to note 1 \u2013 accounting policies of the notes to financial statements (part ii, item\u00a08 of this form 10-k) for further discussion.  impairment of investment securities  we review investments quarterly for indicators of other-than-temporary impairment. this determination requires significant judgment. in making this judgment, we employ a systematic methodology quarterly that considers available quantitative and qualitative evidence in evaluating potential impairment of our investments. if the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value, we evaluate, among other factors, general market conditions, credit quality of debt instrument issuers, the duration and extent to which the fair value is less than cost, and for equity securities, our intent and ability to hold, or plans to sell, the investment. for fixed-income securities, we also evaluate whether we have plans to sell the security or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery. we also consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of and business outlook for the investee, including industry and sector performance, changes in technology, and operational and financing cash flow factors. once a decline in fair value is determined to be other-than-temporary, an impairment charge is recorded to other income (expense), net and a new cost basis in the investment is established. if market, industry, and/or investee conditions deteriorate, we may incur future impairments.  goodwill  we allocate goodwill to reporting units based on the reporting unit expected to benefit from the business combination. we evaluate our reporting units on an annual basis and, if necessary, reassign goodwill using a relative fair value allocation approach. goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level (operating segment or one level below an operating segment) on an annual basis (may 1 for us) and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. these events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate, legal factors, operating performance indicators, competition, or sale or disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit.  application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment, including the identification of reporting units, assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units, assignment of goodwill to reporting units, and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit. the fair value of each reporting unit is estimated primarily through the use of a discounted cash flow methodology. this analysis requires significant judgments, including estimation of future cash flows, which is dependent on internal forecasts, estimation of the long-term rate of growth for our business, estimation of the useful life over which cash flows will occur, and determination of our weighted average cost of capital.  47part ii item 7 \u00a0 the estimates used to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit change from year to year based on operating results, market conditions, and other factors. changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and goodwill impairment for each reporting unit.  research and development costs  costs incurred internally in researching and developing a computer software product are charged to expense until technological feasibility has been established for the product. once technological feasibility is established, all software costs are capitalized until the product is available for general release to customers. judgment is required in determining when technological feasibility of a product is established. we have determined that technological feasibility for our software products is reached after all high-risk development issues have been resolved through coding and testing. generally, this occurs shortly before the products are released to production. the amortization of these costs is included in cost of revenue over the estimated life of the products.  legal and other contingencies  the outcomes of legal proceedings and claims brought against us are subject to significant uncertainty. an estimated loss from a loss contingency such as a legal proceeding or claim is accrued by a charge to income if it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. in determining whether a loss should be accrued we evaluate, among other factors, the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss. changes in these factors could materially impact our consolidated financial statements. income taxes  the objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year, and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entity\u2019s financial statements or tax returns. we recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. accounting literature also provides guidance on derecognition of income tax assets and liabilities, classification of deferred income tax assets and liabilities, accounting for interest and penalties associated with tax positions, and income tax disclosures. judgment is required in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements or tax returns. variations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could materially impact our consolidated financial statements.  the tcja significantly changes existing u.s. tax law and includes numerous provisions that affect our business. refer to note 13 \u2013 income taxes of the notes to financial statements (part ii, item 8 of this form 10-k) for further discussion. inventories  inventories are stated at average cost, subject to the lower of cost or net realizable value. cost includes materials, labor, and manufacturing overhead related to the purchase and production of inventories. net realizable value is the estimated selling price less estimated costs of completion, disposal, and transportation. we regularly review inventory quantities on hand, future purchase commitments with our suppliers, and the estimated utility of our inventory. these reviews include analysis of demand forecasts, product life cycle status, product development plans, current sales levels, pricing strategy, and component cost trends. if our review indicates a reduction in utility below carrying value, we reduce our inventory to a new cost basis through a charge to cost of revenue.  \u00a0 48part ii item 7 \u00a0 statement of management\u2019s responsibility for financial statements  management is responsible for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements and related information that are presented in this report. the consolidated financial statements, which include amounts based on management\u2019s estimates and judgments, have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america.  the company designs and maintains accounting and internal control systems to provide reasonable assurance at reasonable cost that assets are safeguarded against loss from unauthorized use or disposition, and that the financial records are reliable for preparing consolidated financial statements and maintaining accountability for assets. these systems are augmented by written policies, an organizational structure providing division of responsibilities, careful selection and training of qualified personnel, and a program of internal audits.  the company engaged deloitte\u00a0& touche llp, an independent registered public accounting firm, to audit and render an opinion on the consolidated financial statements and internal control over financial reporting in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board (united states).  the board of directors, through its audit committee, consisting solely of independent directors of the company, meets periodically with management, internal auditors, and our independent registered public accounting firm to ensure that each is meeting its responsibilities and to discuss matters concerning internal controls and financial reporting. deloitte\u00a0& touche llp and the internal auditors each have full and free access to the audit committee.  \u00a0   \u00a0 \u00a0 49part ii item 7a \u00a0 item\u00a07a.\u00a0quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk  risks  we are exposed to economic risk from foreign exchange rates, interest rates, credit risk, and equity prices. we use derivatives instruments to manage these risks, however, they may still impact our consolidated financial statements.  foreign currency  certain forecasted transactions, assets, and liabilities are exposed to foreign currency risk. we monitor our foreign currency exposures daily to maximize the economic effectiveness of our foreign currency positions. principal currencies hedged include the euro, japanese yen, british pound, canadian dollar, and australian dollar.  interest rate  securities held in our fixed-income portfolio are subject to different interest rate risks based on their maturities. we manage the average maturity of the fixed-income portfolio to achieve economic returns that correlate to certain global fixed-income indices.  credit our fixed-income portfolio is diversified and consists primarily of investment-grade securities. we manage credit exposures relative to broad-based indices and to facilitate portfolio diversification.  equity securities held in our equity and other investments portfolio are subject to market price risk. sensitivity analysis historically, we used a value-at-risk (\u201cvar\u201d) model to estimate and quantify our market risks. this included presenting one-day var as well as average, high, and low var by risk category throughout the reporting period. given the changes in size and allocation of our portfolio of financial assets, we believe sensitivity analysis is more informative in representing the potential impact to the portfolio as a result of market movements. therefore, we have presented a sensitivity analysis for each risk category below. sensitivity analysis is not intended to represent actual losses in fair value, including determinations of other-than-temporary losses in fair value in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america, but is used as a risk estimation and management tool.  the following table sets forth the potential loss in future earnings or fair values, including associated derivatives, resulting from hypothetical changes in relevant market rates or prices:  \u00a0   \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 50part ii item 8 \u00a0 comprehensive income statements  \u00a0   \u00a0 refer to accompanying notes. refer to note 19 \u2013 accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) for further information. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 52part ii item 8 \u00a0 notes to financial statements  note 1 \u2014 accounting policies  accounting principles  our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america (\u201cgaap\u201d).  we have recast certain prior period income tax liabilities as discussed in the recent tax legislation section below. we have also recast prior period securities lending payables to other current liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets to conform to the current period presentation. these items had no impact in our consolidated income statements or net cash from or used in operating, financing, or investing in our consolidated cash flows statements.  principles of consolidation  the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of microsoft corporation and its subsidiaries. intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated. equity investments for which we are able to exercise significant influence over but do not control the investee and are not the primary beneficiary of the investee\u2019s activities are accounted for using the equity method. investments for which we are not able to exercise significant influence over the investee and which do not have readily determinable fair values are accounted for under the cost method.  estimates and assumptions  preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. examples of estimates and assumptions include: for revenue recognition, determining the nature and timing of satisfaction of performance obligations, and determining the standalone selling price (\u201cssp\u201d) of performance obligations, variable consideration, and other obligations such as product returns and refunds; loss contingencies; product warranties; the fair value of and/or potential impairment of goodwill and intangible assets for our reporting units; product life cycles; useful lives of our tangible and intangible assets; allowances for doubtful accounts; the market value of, and demand for, our inventory; stock-based compensation forfeiture rates; when technological feasibility is achieved for our products; the potential outcome of future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements or tax returns; and determining when investment impairments are other-than-temporary. actual results and outcomes may differ from management\u2019s estimates and assumptions.  foreign currencies  assets and liabilities recorded in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rate on the balance sheet date. revenue and expenses are translated at average rates of exchange prevailing during the year. translation adjustments resulting from this process are recorded to other comprehensive income (\u201coci\u201d).  revenue product revenue and service and other revenue  product revenue includes sales from operating systems; cross-device productivity applications; server applications; business solution applications; desktop and server management tools; software development tools; video games; and hardware such as pcs, tablets, gaming and entertainment consoles, other intelligent devices, and related accessories.  service and other revenue includes sales from cloud-based solutions that provide customers with software, services, platforms, and content such as microsoft office 365, microsoft azure, microsoft dynamics 365, and xbox live; solution support; and consulting services. service and other revenue also includes sales from online advertising and linkedin. 56part ii item 8 \u00a0 revenue recognition revenue is recognized upon transfer of control of promised products or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those products or services. we enter into contracts that can include various combinations of products and services, which are generally capable of being distinct and accounted for as separate performance obligations. revenue is recognized net of allowances for returns and any taxes collected from customers, which are subsequently remitted to governmental authorities. nature of products and services licenses for on-premises software provide the customer with a right to use the software as it exists when made available to the customer. customers may purchase perpetual licenses or subscribe to licenses, which provide customers with the same functionality and differ mainly in the duration over which the customer benefits from the software. revenue from distinct on-premises licenses is recognized upfront at the point in time when the software is made available to the customer. in cases where we allocate revenue to software updates, primarily because the updates are provided at no additional charge, revenue is recognized as the updates are provided, which is generally ratably over the estimated life of the related device or license. certain volume licensing programs, including enterprise agreements, include on-premises licenses combined with software assurance (\u201csa\u201d). sa conveys rights to new software and upgrades released over the contract period and provides support, tools, and training to help customers deploy and use products more efficiently. on-premises licenses are considered distinct performance obligations when sold with sa. revenue allocated to sa is generally recognized ratably over the contract period as customers simultaneously consume and receive benefits, given that sa comprises distinct performance obligations that are satisfied over time.\u00a0\u00a0 cloud services, which allow customers to use hosted software over the contract period without taking possession of the software, are provided on either a subscription or consumption basis. revenue related to cloud services provided on a subscription basis is recognized ratably over the contract period. revenue related to cloud services provided on a consumption basis, such as the amount of storage used in a period, is recognized based on the customer utilization of such resources. when cloud services require a significant level of integration and interdependency with software and the individual components are not considered distinct, all revenue is recognized over the period in which the cloud services are provided.  revenue from search advertising is recognized when the advertisement appears in the search results or when the action necessary to earn the revenue has been completed. revenue from consulting services is recognized as services are provided.  our hardware is generally highly dependent on, and interrelated with, the underlying operating system and cannot function without the operating system. in these cases, the hardware and software license are accounted for as a single performance obligation and revenue is recognized at the point in time when ownership is transferred to resellers or directly to end customers through retail stores and online marketplaces.  refer to note 21 \u2013 segment information and geographic data for further information, including revenue by significant product and service offering. significant judgments our contracts with customers often include promises to transfer multiple products and services to a customer. determining whether products and services are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately versus together may require significant judgment. when a cloud-based service includes both on-premises software licenses and cloud services, judgment is required to determine whether the software license is considered distinct and accounted for separately, or not distinct and accounted for together with the cloud service and recognized over time. certain cloud services, primarily office 365, depend on a significant level of integration, interdependency, and interrelation between the desktop applications and cloud services, and are accounted for together as one performance obligation. revenue from office 365 is recognized ratably over the period in which the cloud services are provided. 57part ii item 8 \u00a0 judgment is required to determine the ssp for each distinct performance obligation. we use a single amount to estimate ssp for items that are not sold separately, including on-premises licenses sold with sa or software updates provided at no additional charge. we use a range of amounts to estimate ssp when we sell each of the products and services separately and need to determine whether there is a discount to be allocated based on the relative ssp of the various products and services.  in instances where ssp is not directly observable, such as when we do not sell the product or service separately, we determine the ssp using information that may include market conditions and other observable inputs. we typically have more than one ssp for individual products and services due to the stratification of those products and services by customers and circumstances. in these instances, we may use information such as the size of the customer and geographic region in determining the ssp.\u00a0\u00a0 due to the various benefits from and the nature of our sa program, judgment is required to assess the pattern of delivery, including the exercise pattern of certain benefits across our portfolio of customers.\u00a0\u00a0 our products are generally sold with a right of return, we may provide other credits or incentives, and in certain instances we estimate customer usage of our products and services, which are accounted for as variable consideration when determining the amount of revenue to recognize. returns and credits are estimated at contract inception and updated at the end of each reporting period if additional information becomes available. changes to our estimated variable consideration were not material for the periods presented. contract balances\u00a0\u00a0 timing of revenue recognition may differ from the timing of invoicing to customers. we record a receivable when revenue is recognized prior to invoicing, or unearned revenue when revenue is recognized subsequent to invoicing. for multi-year agreements, we generally invoice customers annually at the beginning of each annual coverage period. we record a receivable related to revenue recognized for multi-year on-premises licenses as we have an unconditional right to invoice and receive payment in the future related to those licenses.  the opening balance of current and long-term accounts receivable, net of allowance for doubtful accounts, was $22.3 billion as of july 1, 2016. as of june 30, 2018 and 2017, long-term accounts receivable, net of allowance for doubtful accounts, were $1.8 billion and $1.7 billion, respectively, and are included in other long-term assets in our consolidated balance sheets. the allowance for doubtful accounts reflects our best estimate of probable losses inherent in the accounts receivable balance. we determine the allowance based on known troubled accounts, historical experience, and other currently available evidence.  activity in the allowance for doubtful accounts was as follows: \u00a0   \u00a0 allowance for doubtful accounts included in our consolidated balance sheets: \u00a0   \u00a0 58part ii item 8 \u00a0 unearned revenue comprises mainly unearned revenue related to volume licensing programs, which may include sa and cloud services. unearned revenue is generally invoiced annually at the beginning of each contract period for multi-year agreements and recognized ratably over the coverage period. unearned revenue also includes payments for consulting services to be performed in the future; linkedin subscriptions; office 365 subscriptions; xbox live subscriptions; windows 10 post-delivery support; dynamics business solutions; skype prepaid credits and subscriptions; and other offerings for which we have been paid in advance and earn the revenue when we transfer control of the product or service.  refer to note 15 \u2013 unearned revenue for further information, including unearned revenue by segment and changes in unearned revenue during the period. payment terms and conditions vary by contract type, although terms generally include a requirement of payment within 30 to 60 days. in instances where the timing of revenue recognition differs from the timing of invoicing, we have determined our contracts generally do not include a significant financing component. the primary purpose of our invoicing terms is to provide customers with simplified and predictable ways of purchasing our products and services, not to receive financing from our customers or to provide customers with financing. examples include invoicing at the beginning of a subscription term with revenue recognized ratably over the contract period, and multi-year on-premises licenses that are invoiced annually with revenue recognized upfront. assets recognized from costs to obtain a contract with a customer we recognize an asset for the incremental costs of obtaining a contract with a customer if we expect the benefit of those costs to be longer than one year. we have determined that certain sales incentive programs meet the requirements to be capitalized. total capitalized costs to obtain a contract were immaterial during the periods presented and are included in other current and long-term assets in our consolidated balance sheets.  we apply a practical expedient to expense costs as incurred for costs to obtain a contract with a customer when the amortization period would have been one year or less. these costs include our internal sales force compensation program and certain partner sales incentive programs as we have determined annual compensation is commensurate with annual sales activities. cost of revenue  cost of revenue includes: manufacturing and distribution costs for products sold and programs licensed; operating costs related to product support service centers and product distribution centers; costs incurred to include software on pcs sold by original equipment manufacturers (\u201coem\u201d), to drive traffic to our websites, and to acquire online advertising space; costs incurred to support and maintain internet-based products and services, including datacenter costs and royalties; warranty costs; inventory valuation adjustments; costs associated with the delivery of consulting services; and the amortization of capitalized software development costs. capitalized software development costs are amortized over the estimated lives of the products.  product warranty  we provide for the estimated costs of fulfilling our obligations under hardware and software warranties at the time the related revenue is recognized. for hardware warranties, we estimate the costs based on historical and projected product failure rates, historical and projected repair costs, and knowledge of specific product failures (if any). the specific hardware warranty terms and conditions vary depending upon the product sold and the country in which we do business, but generally include parts and labor over a period generally ranging from 90\u00a0days to three years. for software warranties, we estimate the costs to provide bug fixes, such as security patches, over the estimated life of the software. we regularly reevaluate our estimates to assess the adequacy of the recorded warranty liabilities and adjust the amounts as necessary.  59part ii item 8 \u00a0 research and development  research and development expenses include payroll, employee benefits, stock-based compensation expense, and other headcount-related expenses associated with product development. research and development expenses also include third-party development and programming costs, localization costs incurred to translate software for international markets, and the amortization of purchased software code and services content. such costs related to software development are included in research and development expense until the point that technological feasibility is reached, which for our software products, is generally shortly before the products are released to production. once technological feasibility is reached, such costs are capitalized and amortized to cost of revenue over the estimated lives of the products.  sales and marketing  sales and marketing expenses include payroll, employee benefits, stock-based compensation expense, and other headcount-related expenses associated with sales and marketing personnel, and the costs of advertising, promotions, trade shows, seminars, and other programs. advertising costs are expensed as incurred. advertising expense was $1.6 billion, $1.5 billion, and $1.6 billion in fiscal years 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively.  stock-based compensation  compensation cost for stock awards, which include restricted stock units (\u201crsus\u201d) and performance stock units (\u201cpsus\u201d), is measured at the fair value on the grant date and recognized as expense, net of estimated forfeitures, over the related service or performance period. the fair value of stock awards is based on the quoted price of our common stock on the grant date less the present value of expected dividends not received during the vesting period. we measure the fair value of psus using a monte carlo valuation model. compensation cost for rsus is recognized using the straight-line method and for psus is recognized using the accelerated method.  compensation expense for the employee stock purchase plan (\u201cespp\u201d) is measured as the discount the employee is entitled to upon purchase and is recognized in the period of purchase.  income taxes  income tax expense includes u.s. and international income taxes, and interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions. certain income and expenses are not reported in tax returns and financial statements in the same year. the tax effect of such temporary differences is reported as deferred income taxes. deferred tax assets are reported net of a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized. all deferred income taxes are classified as long-term in our consolidated balance sheets.  60part ii item 8 \u00a0 fair value measurements  we account for certain assets and liabilities at fair value. the hierarchy below lists three levels of fair value based on the extent to which inputs used in measuring fair value are observable in the market.\u00a0we categorize each of our fair value measurements in one of these three levels based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. these levels are:        we measure certain assets, including our cost and equity method investments, at fair value on a nonrecurring basis when they are deemed to be other-than-temporarily impaired. the fair values of these investments are determined based on valuation techniques using the best information available, and may include quoted market prices, market comparables, and discounted cash flow projections. an impairment charge is recorded when the cost of the investment exceeds its fair value and this condition is determined to be other-than-temporary.  our other current financial assets and current financial liabilities have fair values that approximate their carrying values.  financial instruments  investments we consider all highly liquid interest-earning investments with a maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase to be cash equivalents. the fair values of these investments approximate their carrying values. in general, investments with original maturities of greater than three months and remaining maturities of less than one year are classified as short-term investments. investments with maturities beyond one year may be classified as short-term based on their highly liquid nature and because such marketable securities represent the investment of cash that is available for current operations. all cash equivalents and short-term investments are classified as available-for-sale and realized gains and losses are recorded using the specific identification method. changes in market value, excluding other-than-temporary impairments, are reflected in oci.  equity and other investments classified as long-term include both debt and equity instruments. debt and publicly-traded equity securities are classified as available-for-sale and realized gains and losses are recorded using the specific identification method. changes in the market value of available-for-sale securities, excluding other-than-temporary impairments, are reflected in oci. common and preferred stock and other investments that are restricted for more than one year or are not publicly traded are recorded at cost or using the equity method.  61part ii item 8 \u00a0 we lend certain fixed-income and equity securities to increase investment returns. these transactions are accounted for as secured borrowings and the loaned securities continue to be carried as investments in our consolidated balance sheets. cash and/or security interests are received as collateral for the loaned securities with the amount determined based upon the underlying security lent and the creditworthiness of the borrower. cash received is recorded as an asset with a corresponding liability.  investments are considered to be impaired when a decline in fair value is judged to be other-than-temporary. fair value is calculated based on publicly available market information or other estimates determined by management. we employ a systematic methodology on a quarterly basis that considers available quantitative and qualitative evidence in evaluating potential impairment of our investments. if the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value, we evaluate, among other factors, general market conditions, credit quality of debt instrument issuers, the duration and extent to which the fair value is less than cost, and for equity securities, our intent and ability to hold, or plans to sell, the investment. for fixed-income securities, we also evaluate whether we have plans to sell the security or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery. we also consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of and business outlook for the investee, including industry and sector performance, changes in technology, and operational and financing cash flow factors. once a decline in fair value is determined to be other-than-temporary, an impairment charge is recorded to other income (expense), net and a new cost basis in the investment is established.  derivatives derivative instruments are recognized as either assets or liabilities and are measured at fair value. the accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation.  for derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges, the gains (losses) are recognized in earnings in the periods of change together with the offsetting losses (gains) on the hedged items attributed to the risk being hedged. for options designated as fair value hedges, changes in the time value are excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and are recognized in earnings.  for derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges, the effective portion of the gains (losses) on the derivatives is initially reported as a component of oci and is subsequently recognized in earnings when the hedged exposure is recognized in earnings. for options designated as cash flow hedges, changes in the time value are excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and are recognized in earnings. gains (losses) on derivatives representing either hedge components excluded from the assessment of effectiveness or hedge ineffectiveness are recognized in earnings.  for derivative instruments that are not designated as hedges, gains (losses) from changes in fair values are primarily recognized in other income (expense), net.  inventories  inventories are stated at average cost, subject to the lower of cost or net realizable value. cost includes materials, labor, and manufacturing overhead related to the purchase and production of inventories. net realizable value is the estimated selling price less estimated costs of completion, disposal, and transportation. we regularly review inventory quantities on hand, future purchase commitments with our suppliers, and the estimated utility of our inventory. if our review indicates a reduction in utility below carrying value, we reduce our inventory to a new cost basis through a charge to cost of revenue.  property and equipment  property and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation, and depreciated using the straight-line method over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the asset or the lease term. the estimated useful lives of our property and equipment are generally as follows: computer software developed or acquired for internal use, three to seven years; computer equipment, two to three years; buildings and improvements, five to 15 years; leasehold improvements, three to 20 years; and furniture and equipment, one to 10 years. land is not depreciated.  62part ii item 8 \u00a0 leases we determine if an arrangement is a lease at inception. operating leases are included in operating lease right-of-use (\u201crou\u201d) assets, other current liabilities, and operating lease liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets. finance leases are included in property and equipment, other current liabilities, and other long-term liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets.\u00a0\u00a0 rou assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. operating lease rou assets and liabilities are recognized at commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. as most of our leases do not provide an implicit rate, we use our incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments. we use the implicit rate when readily determinable. the operating lease rou asset also includes any lease payments made and excludes lease incentives. our lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. lease expense for lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.  we have lease agreements with lease and non-lease components, which are generally accounted for separately. for certain equipment leases, such as vehicles, we account for the lease and non-lease components as a single lease component. additionally, for certain equipment leases, we apply a portfolio approach to effectively account for the operating lease rou assets and liabilities.  goodwill  goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level (operating segment or one level below an operating segment) on an annual basis (may 1 for us) and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value.  intangible assets  all of our intangible assets are subject to amortization and are amortized using the straight-line method over their estimated period of benefit, ranging from one to 20 years. we evaluate the recoverability of intangible assets periodically by taking into account events or circumstances that may warrant revised estimates of useful lives or that indicate the asset may be impaired.  recent tax legislation  on december 22, 2017, the tax cuts and jobs act (\u201ctcja\u201d) was enacted into law, which significantly changes existing u.s. tax law and includes numerous provisions that affect our business. refer to note 13 \u2013 income taxes for further discussion.  63part ii item 8 \u00a0 as a result of the tcja, we have recast certain prior period income tax liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets to conform to the current period presentation. previously reported balances were impacted as follows: \u00a0   these adjustments had no impact in our consolidated income statements or net cash from or used in operating, financing, or investing in our consolidated cash flows statements. recent accounting guidance  recently adopted accounting guidance comprehensive income \u2013 reclassification of certain tax effects in february 2018, the financial accounting standards board (\u201cfasb\u201d) issued new guidance to allow a reclassification from accumulated other comprehensive income (\u201caoci\u201d) to retained earnings for stranded tax effects resulting from the tcja. in the second quarter of fiscal year 2018, we remeasured our deferred taxes related to unrealized gains on our investment balances using the reduced tax rate. as required by gaap, we recognized the net tax benefit in the provision for income taxes in our consolidated income statements, even though the deferred taxes were initially recognized in aoci, which resulted in stranded tax effects. we elected to early adopt the standard effective april 1, 2018 and reclassified a $42 million net tax benefit from aoci to retained earnings in our consolidated balance sheets. adoption of the standard had no impact to our consolidated income statements or cash flows statements. leases  in february 2016, the fasb issued a new standard related to leases to increase transparency and comparability among organizations by requiring the recognition of rou assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet. most prominent among the changes in the standard is the recognition of rou assets and lease liabilities by lessees for those leases classified as operating leases. under the standard, disclosures are required to meet the objective of enabling users of financial statements to assess the amount, timing, and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases. we are also required to recognize and measure leases existing at, or entered into after, the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented using a modified retrospective approach, with certain practical expedients available.  we elected to early adopt the standard effective july\u00a01, 2017 concurrent with our adoption of the new standard related to revenue recognition.\u00a0we elected the available practical expedients and implemented internal controls and key system functionality to enable the preparation of financial information on adoption.  the standard had a material impact in our consolidated balance sheets, but did not have an impact in our consolidated income statements. the most significant impact was the recognition of rou assets and lease liabilities for operating leases, while our accounting for finance leases remained substantially unchanged. adoption of the standard required us to restate certain previously reported results, including the recognition of additional rou assets and lease liabilities for operating leases. refer to impacts to previously reported results below for the impact of adoption of the standard in our consolidated financial statements.  revenue from contracts with customers  in may 2014, the fasb issued a new standard related to revenue recognition. under the standard, revenue is recognized when a customer obtains control of promised goods or services in an amount that reflects the consideration the entity expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. in addition, the standard requires disclosure of the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers.  64part ii item 8 \u00a0 we elected to early adopt the standard effective july\u00a01, 2017, using the full retrospective method, which required us to restate each prior reporting period presented. we implemented internal controls and key system functionality to enable the preparation of financial information on adoption. the most significant impact of the standard relates to our accounting for software license revenue. specifically, for windows 10, we recognize revenue predominantly at the time of billing and delivery rather than ratably over the life of the related device. for certain multi-year commercial software subscriptions that include both distinct software licenses and sa, we recognize license revenue at the time of contract execution rather than over the subscription period. due to the complexity of certain of our commercial license subscription contracts, the actual revenue recognition treatment required under the standard depends on contract-specific terms and in some instances may vary from recognition at the time of billing. revenue recognition related to our hardware, cloud offerings (such as office 365), linkedin, and professional services remains substantially unchanged. adoption of the standard using the full retrospective method required us to restate certain previously reported results, including the recognition of additional revenue and an increase in the provision for income taxes, primarily due to the net change in windows 10 revenue recognition. in addition, adoption of the standard resulted in an increase in accounts receivable and other current and long-term assets, driven by unbilled receivables from upfront recognition of revenue for certain multi-year commercial software subscriptions that include both distinct software licenses and sa; a reduction of unearned revenue, driven by the upfront recognition of license revenue from windows 10 and certain multi-year commercial software subscriptions; and an increase in deferred income taxes, driven by the upfront recognition of revenue. refer to impacts to previously reported results below for the impact of adoption of the standard in our consolidated financial statements.  impacts to previously reported results  adoption of the standards related to revenue recognition and leases impacted our previously reported results as follows:  \u00a0   \u00a0   65part ii item 8 \u00a0   adoption of the standards related to revenue recognition and leases had no impact to cash from or used in operating, financing, or investing in our consolidated cash flows statements. recent accounting guidance not yet adopted  financial instruments \u2013 targeted improvements to accounting for hedging activities  in august 2017, the fasb issued new guidance related to accounting for hedging activities. this guidance expands strategies that qualify for hedge accounting, changes how many hedging relationships are presented in the financial statements, and simplifies the application of hedge accounting in certain situations. the standard will be effective for us beginning july 1, 2019, with early adoption permitted for any interim or annual period before the effective date. adoption of the standard will be applied using a modified retrospective approach through a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the effective date. we are currently evaluating the impact of this standard in our consolidated financial statements, including accounting policies, processes, and systems. income taxes \u2013 intra-entity asset transfers in october 2016, the fasb issued new guidance requiring an entity to recognize the income tax consequences of an intra-entity transfer of an asset other than inventory when the transfer occurs, rather than when the asset has been sold to an outside party. this guidance is effective for us beginning july 1, 2018, with early adoption permitted beginning july 1, 2017. we plan to adopt the guidance effective july 1, 2018. adoption of the guidance will be applied using a modified retrospective approach through a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the effective date. we currently expect a net cumulative-effect adjustment of approximately $550 million, which will reverse the deferral of income tax consequences from past intra-entity transfers involving assets other than inventory and new deferred tax assets for amounts not recognized under current gaap, partially offset by a u.s. deferred tax liability related to global intangible low-taxed income (\u201cgilti\u201d). adoption of the standard is expected to result in an increase in long-term deferred tax assets of $2.8 billion, an increase in long-term deferred tax liabilities of $2.1 billion, and a reduction to other current assets of $150 million. as a result of the tcja, we are continuing to evaluate the impact of this standard in our consolidated financial statements, including accounting policies, processes, and systems. financial instruments \u2013 credit losses  in june 2016, the fasb issued a new standard to replace the incurred loss impairment methodology under current gaap with a methodology that reflects expected credit losses and requires consideration of a broader range of reasonable and supportable information to inform credit loss estimates. we will be required to use a forward-looking expected credit loss model for accounts receivables, loans, and other financial instruments. credit losses relating to available-for-sale debt securities will also be recorded through an allowance for credit losses rather than as a reduction in the amortized cost basis of the securities. the standard will be effective for us beginning july\u00a01, 2020, with early adoption permitted beginning july\u00a01, 2019. adoption of the standard will be applied using a modified retrospective approach through a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the effective date to align our credit loss methodology with the new standard. we are currently evaluating the impact of this standard in our consolidated financial statements, including accounting policies, processes, and systems.\u00a0\u00a0 66part ii item 8 \u00a0 financial instruments \u2013 recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure  in january 2016, the fasb issued a new standard related to certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure of financial instruments. most prominent among the changes in the standard is the requirement for changes in the fair value of our equity investments, with certain exceptions, to be recognized through net income rather than oci. under the standard, equity investments that do not have a readily determinable fair value are eligible for the measurement alternative. using the measurement alternative, investments without readily determinable fair values will be valued at cost, with adjustments for changes in price or impairments reflected through net income. the standard will be effective for us beginning july\u00a01, 2018. adoption of the standard will be applied using a modified retrospective approach through a cumulative-effect adjustment from aoci to retained earnings as of the effective date. a cumulative-effect adjustment will capture any previously held unrealized gains and losses held in aoci related to our equity investments carried at fair value as well as the impact of recording the fair value of certain equity investments carried at cost. in preparation for adoption of this standard, we have implemented internal controls to align with the new standard and have concluded that we will elect the measurement alternative for equity investments that do not have readily determinable fair values. the impact in our consolidated balance sheets upon adoption will not be material. adoption of the standard will have no impact to cash from or used in operating, financing or investing in our consolidated cash flows statements. \u00a0 note 2 \u2014 earnings per share basic earnings per share (\u201ceps\u201d) is computed based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. diluted eps is computed based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock plus the effect of dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period using the treasury stock method. dilutive potential common shares include outstanding stock options and stock awards. the components of basic and diluted eps were as follows: \u00a0   \u00a0 anti-dilutive stock-based awards excluded from the calculations of diluted eps were immaterial during the periods presented. note 3 \u2014 other income (expense), net  the components of other income (expense), net were as follows:  \u00a0   67part ii item 8 \u00a0 following are details of net recognized gains (losses) on investments during the periods reported:  \u00a0   \u00a0 note 4\u00a0\u2014\u00a0investments investment components  the components of investments, including associated derivatives, were as follows:  \u00a0   \u00a0   \u00a0 68part ii item 8 \u00a0 as of june 30, 2018 and 2017, the recorded bases of common and preferred stock that are restricted for more than one year or are not publicly traded were $999 million and $1.1 billion, respectively. these investments are carried at cost and are reviewed quarterly for indicators of other-than-temporary impairment. it is not practicable for us to reliably estimate the fair value of these investments.  as of june 30, 2018 and 2017, collateral received under agreements for loaned securities was $1.8 billion and $3.7 billion, respectively, and primarily comprised u.s. government and agency securities.  unrealized losses on investments  investments with continuous unrealized losses for less than 12 months and 12 months or greater and their related fair values were as follows:  \u00a0   \u00a0   \u00a0 unrealized losses from fixed-income securities are primarily attributable to changes in interest rates. unrealized losses from domestic and international equities are due to market price movements. management does not believe any remaining unrealized losses represent other-than-temporary impairments based on our evaluation of available evidence.  debt investment maturities  \u00a0   \u00a0 69part ii item 8 \u00a0 note 5 \u2014 derivatives  we use derivative instruments to manage risks related to foreign currencies, equity prices, interest rates, and credit; to enhance investment returns; and to facilitate portfolio diversification. our objectives for holding derivatives include reducing, eliminating, and efficiently managing the economic impact of these exposures as effectively as possible.  our derivative programs include strategies that both qualify and do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment. all notional amounts presented below are measured in u.s. dollar equivalents.  foreign currency  certain forecasted transactions, assets, and liabilities are exposed to foreign currency risk. we monitor our foreign currency exposures daily to maximize the economic effectiveness of our foreign currency hedge positions. option and forward contracts are used to hedge a portion of forecasted international revenue for up to three years in the future and are designated as cash flow hedging instruments. principal currencies hedged include the euro, japanese yen, british pound, canadian dollar, and australian dollar. as of june 30, 2018 and 2017, the total notional amounts of these foreign exchange contracts sold were $6.1 billion and $8.9 billion, respectively.  foreign currency risks related to certain non-u.s. dollar denominated securities are hedged using foreign exchange forward contracts that are designated as fair value hedging instruments. as of june 30, 2018 and 2017, the total notional amounts of these foreign exchange contracts sold were $5.0 billion and $5.1 billion, respectively.  certain options and forwards not designated as hedging instruments are also used to manage the variability in foreign exchange rates on certain balance sheet amounts and to manage other foreign currency exposures.\u00a0as of june 30, 2018, the total notional amounts of these foreign exchange contracts purchased and sold were $9.4 billion and $13.4 billion, respectively. as of june\u00a030, 2017, the total notional amounts of these foreign exchange contracts purchased and sold were $8.8 billion and $10.6 billion, respectively.  equity  securities held in our equity and other investments portfolio are subject to market price risk.\u00a0market price risk is managed relative to broad-based global and domestic equity indices using certain convertible preferred investments, options, futures, and swap contracts not designated as hedging instruments. from time to time, to hedge our price risk, we may use and designate equity derivatives as hedging instruments, including puts, calls, swaps, and forwards.\u00a0as of june 30, 2018, the total notional amounts of equity contracts purchased and sold for managing market price risk were $49 million and $5 million, respectively. as of june\u00a030, 2017, the total notional amounts of equity contracts purchased and sold for managing market price risk were $1.9 billion and $2.4 billion, respectively, of which $1.6 billion and $1.8 billion, respectively, were designated as hedging instruments.  interest rate  securities held in our fixed-income portfolio are subject to different interest rate risks based on their maturities. we manage the average maturity of our fixed-income portfolio to achieve economic returns that correlate to certain broad-based fixed-income indices using exchange-traded option and futures contracts, and over-the-counter swap and option contracts, none of which are designated as hedging instruments. as of june 30, 2018, the total notional amounts of fixed-interest rate contracts purchased and sold were $306 million and $390 million, respectively. as of june\u00a030, 2017, the total notional amounts of fixed-interest rate contracts purchased and sold were $233 million and $352 million, respectively.  in addition, we use \u201cto be announced\u201d forward purchase commitments of mortgage-backed assets to gain exposure to agency mortgage-backed securities.\u00a0these meet the definition of a derivative instrument in cases where physical delivery of the assets is not taken at the earliest available delivery date. as of june 30, 2018 and 2017, the total notional derivative amounts of mortgage contracts purchased were $568 million and $567 million, respectively.  70part ii item 8 \u00a0 credit  our fixed-income portfolio is diversified and consists primarily of investment-grade securities. we use credit default swap contracts, not designated as hedging instruments, to manage credit exposures relative to broad-based indices and to facilitate portfolio diversification. we use credit default swaps as they are a low-cost method of managing exposure to individual credit risks or groups of credit risks. as of june 30, 2018, the total notional amounts of credit contracts purchased and sold were $4 million and $82 million, respectively. as of june 30, 2017, the total notional amounts of credit contracts purchased and sold were $267 million and $63 million, respectively.  credit-risk-related contingent features  certain of our counterparty agreements for derivative instruments contain provisions that require our issued and outstanding long-term unsecured debt to maintain an investment grade credit rating and require us to maintain minimum liquidity of $1.0 billion. to the extent we fail to meet these requirements, we will be required to post collateral, similar to the standard convention related to over-the-counter derivatives. as of june 30, 2018, our long-term unsecured debt rating was aaa, and cash investments were in excess of $1.0 billion. as a result, no collateral was required to be posted.  fair values of derivative instruments  the following table presents the fair values of derivative instruments designated as hedging instruments (\u201cdesignated hedge derivatives\u201d) and not designated as hedging instruments (\u201cnon-designated hedge derivatives\u201d). the fair values exclude the impact of netting derivative assets and liabilities when a legally enforceable master netting agreement exists and fair value adjustments related to our own credit risk and counterparty credit risk:  \u00a0   \u00a0   71part ii item 8 \u00a0   \u00a0 refer to note 4 \u2013 investments and note\u00a06 \u2013 fair value measurements for further information.  \u00a0 fair value hedge gains (losses)  we recognized in other income (expense), net the following gains (losses) on contracts designated as fair value hedges and their related hedged items: \u00a0   \u00a0 72part ii item 8 \u00a0 cash flow hedge gains (losses)  we recognized the following gains (losses) on foreign exchange contracts designated as cash flow hedges:  \u00a0   \u00a0 we estimate that $179 million of net derivative gains included in aoci as of june 30, 2018 will be reclassified into earnings within the following 12 months. no significant amounts of gains (losses) were reclassified from aoci into earnings as a result of forecasted transactions that failed to occur during fiscal year 2018.  non-designated derivative gains (losses)  gains (losses) from changes in fair values of derivatives that are not designated as hedges are primarily recognized in other income (expense), net. these amounts are shown in the table below, with the exception of gains (losses) on derivatives presented in income statement line items other than other income (expense), net, which were immaterial for the periods presented.  \u00a0   \u00a0 \u00a0 73part ii item 8 \u00a0 note 6 \u2014 fair value measurements  financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis  the following tables present the fair value of our financial instruments that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis:  \u00a0   \u00a0   \u00a0   the changes in our level 3 financial instruments that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis were immaterial during the periods presented.  74part ii item 8 \u00a0 the following table reconciles the total \u201cnet fair value\u201d of assets above to the balance sheet presentation of these same assets in note 4 \u2013 investments.  \u00a0   \u00a0 financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis  during fiscal year 2018 and 2017, we did not record any material other-than-temporary impairments on financial assets required to be measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis.  note 7 \u2014 inventories  the components of inventories were as follows:  \u00a0   \u00a0 note 8 \u2014 property and equipment  the components of property and equipment were as follows:  \u00a0   \u00a0 during fiscal years 2018, 2017, and 2016, depreciation expense was $7.7 billion, $6.1 billion, and $4.9 billion, respectively. we have committed $1.9 billion for the construction of new buildings, building improvements, and leasehold improvements as of june 30, 2018.  \u00a0 75part ii item 8 \u00a0 note 9 \u2014 business combinations  linkedin corporation on december 8, 2016, we completed our acquisition of all issued and outstanding shares of linkedin corporation, the world\u2019s largest professional network on the internet, for a total purchase price of $27.0 billion. the purchase price consisted primarily of cash of $26.9 billion. the acquisition is expected to accelerate the growth of linkedin, office 365, and dynamics 365. the financial results of linkedin have been included in our consolidated financial statements since the date of the acquisition. the allocation of the purchase price to goodwill was completed as of june 30, 2017.  the major classes of assets and liabilities to which we allocated the purchase price were as follows:\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0   \u00a0     following are the details of the purchase price allocated to the intangible assets acquired:  \u00a0   our consolidated income statements include the following revenue and operating loss attributable to linkedin since the date of acquisition: \u00a0   76part ii item 8 \u00a0 following are the supplemental consolidated financial results of microsoft corporation on an unaudited pro forma basis, as if the acquisition had been consummated on july\u00a01, 2015:  \u00a0   \u00a0 these pro forma results were based on estimates and assumptions, which we believe are reasonable. they are not the results that would have been realized had we been a combined company during the periods presented and are not necessarily indicative of our consolidated results of operations in future periods. the pro forma results include adjustments related to purchase accounting, primarily amortization of intangible assets. acquisition costs and other nonrecurring charges were immaterial and are included in the earliest period presented.  github inc. on june 4, 2018, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire github inc. (\u201cgithub\u201d) for $7.5 billion in an all-stock transaction. we expect the acquisition will close by the end of the calendar year, subject to approval by github\u2019s shareholders, satisfaction of certain regulatory approvals, and other customary closing conditions. github will be included in our consolidated results of operations as of the date of acquisition. other during fiscal year 2018, we completed nine acquisitions for total consideration of $948 million, substantially all of which was paid in cash. these entities have been included in our consolidated results of operations since their respective acquisition dates. pro forma results of operations for these acquisitions have not been presented because the effects of these business combinations, individually and in aggregate, were not material to our consolidated results of operations. note 10 \u2014 goodwill  changes in the carrying amount of goodwill were as follows:  \u00a0   \u00a0   the measurement periods for the valuation of assets acquired and liabilities assumed end as soon as information on the facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition dates becomes available, but do not exceed 12 months. adjustments in purchase price allocations may require a change in the amounts allocated to goodwill during the periods in which the adjustments are determined.  any change in the goodwill amounts resulting from foreign currency translations and purchase accounting adjustments are presented as \u201cother\u201d in the above table. also included in \u201cother\u201d are business dispositions and transfers between segments due to reorganizations, as applicable.  as of june 30, 2018 and 2017, accumulated goodwill impairment was $11.3 billion. 77part ii item 8 \u00a0 goodwill impairment\u00a0\u00a0 we test goodwill for impairment annually on may\u00a01 at the reporting unit level, primarily using a discounted cash flow methodology with a peer-based, risk-adjusted weighted average cost of capital. we believe use of a discounted cash flow approach is the most reliable indicator of the fair values of the businesses.  no instances of impairment were identified in our may 1, 2018, may 1, 2017, or may 1, 2016 tests.  note 11 \u2014 intangible assets  the components of intangible assets, all of which are finite-lived, were as follows:  \u00a0   \u00a0 no material impairments of intangible assets were identified during fiscal year 2018 or 2017. during fiscal year 2016, we recorded impairment charges of $480 million related to intangible assets in the devices reporting unit within our more personal computing segment. in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016, we tested these intangible assets for recoverability due to changes in facts and circumstances associated with the shift in strategic direction and reduced profitability expectations for our phone business. based on the results of our testing, we determined that the carrying value of the intangible assets was not recoverable, and an impairment charge was recorded to the extent that estimated fair value exceeded carrying value. we primarily used the income approach to determine the fair value of the intangible assets and determine the amount of impairment. these intangible assets impairment charges were included in impairment and restructuring expenses in our consolidated income statement and reflected in corporate and other in our table of operating income (loss) by segment in note 21 \u2013 segment information and geographic data.  we estimate that we have no significant residual value related to our intangible assets.  the components of intangible assets acquired during the periods presented were as follows:  \u00a0   \u00a0 intangible assets amortization expense was $2.2 billion, $1.7 billion, and $978 million for fiscal years 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively. amortization of capitalized software was $54 million, $55 million, and $69 million for fiscal years 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively.  78part ii item 8 \u00a0 the following table outlines the estimated future amortization expense related to intangible assets held as of june\u00a030, 2018:  \u00a0   \u00a0 note 12 \u2014 debt  short-term debt as of june 30, 2018, we had no commercial paper issued and outstanding. as of june\u00a030, 2017, we had $9.1 billion of commercial paper issued and outstanding, with a weighted average interest rate of 1.01% and maturities ranging from 25 days to 264 days. the estimated fair value of this commercial paper approximates its carrying value. we have two $5.0 billion credit facilities that expire on october 30, 2018 and october 31, 2022, respectively. these credit facilities serve as a back-up for our commercial paper program. as of june 30, 2018, we were in compliance with the only financial covenant in both credit agreements, which requires us to maintain a coverage ratio of at least three times earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization to interest expense, as defined in the credit agreements. no amounts were drawn against these credit facilities during any of the periods presented.  long-term debt as of june 30, 2018, the total carrying value and estimated fair value of our long-term debt, including the current portion, were $76.2 billion and $77.5 billion, respectively. as of june 30, 2017, the total carrying value and estimated fair value of our long-term debt, including the current portion, were $77.1 billion and $80.3 billion, respectively. these estimated fair values are based on level 2 inputs.  79part ii item 8 \u00a0 the components of our long-term debt, including the current portion, and the associated interest rates were as follows:  \u00a0   \u00a0   80part ii item 8 \u00a0 the notes in the table above are senior unsecured obligations and rank equally with our other senior unsecured debt outstanding. interest on these notes is paid semi-annually, except for the euro-denominated debt securities on which interest is paid annually. cash paid for interest on our debt for fiscal years 2018, 2017, and 2016 was $2.4 billion, $1.6 billion, and $1.1 billion, respectively. as of june 30, 2018 and 2017, the aggregate debt issuance costs and unamortized discount associated with our long-term debt, including the current portion, were $658 million and $715 million, respectively.  maturities of our long-term debt for each of the next five years and thereafter are as follows:  \u00a0   \u00a0 note 13 \u2014 income taxes  recent tax legislation  on december 22, 2017, the tcja was enacted into law, which significantly changes existing u.s. tax law and includes numerous provisions that affect our business, such as imposing a one-time transition tax on deemed repatriation of deferred foreign income, reducing the u.s. federal statutory tax rate, and adopting a territorial tax system. the tcja required us to incur a one-time transition tax on deferred foreign income not previously subject to u.s. income tax at a rate of 15.5% for foreign cash and certain other net current assets, and 8% on the remaining income. the tcja also reduced the u.s. federal statutory tax rate from 35% to 21% effective january 1, 2018. for fiscal year 2018, our blended u.s. federal statutory tax rate is 28.1%. this is the result of using the tax rate of 35% for the first and second quarter of fiscal year 2018 and the reduced tax rate of 21% for the third and fourth quarter of fiscal year 2018. the tcja includes a provision to tax global intangible low-taxed income (\u201cgilti\u201d) of foreign subsidiaries and a base erosion anti-abuse tax (\u201cbeat\u201d) measure that taxes certain payments between a u.s. corporation and its foreign subsidiaries. the gilti and beat provisions of the tcja will be effective for us beginning july 1, 2018. the tcja was effective in the second quarter of fiscal year 2018. as of june 30, 2018, we have not completed our accounting for the estimated tax effects of the tcja. during fiscal year 2018, we recorded a provisional net charge of $13.7 billion related to the tcja based on reasonable estimates for those tax effects. due to the timing of the enactment and the complexity in applying the provisions of the tcja, the provisional net charge is subject to revisions as we continue to complete our analysis of the tcja, collect and prepare necessary data, and interpret any additional guidance issued by the u.s. treasury department, internal revenue service (\u201cirs\u201d), fasb, and other standard-setting and regulatory bodies. adjustments may materially impact our provision for income taxes and effective tax rate in the period in which the adjustments are made. our accounting for the estimated tax effects of the tcja will be completed during the measurement period, which is not expected to extend beyond one year from the enactment date. the impacts of our estimates are described further below. during fiscal year 2018, we recorded an estimated net charge of $13.7 billion related to the tcja, due to the impact of the one-time transition tax on the deemed repatriation of deferred foreign income of $17.9 billion, offset in part by the impact of changes in the tax rate of $4.2 billion, primarily on deferred tax assets and liabilities.  we recorded an estimated $17.9 billion charge in fiscal year 2018 related to the transition tax, which was included in the provision for income taxes in our consolidated income statements and income taxes in our consolidated balance sheets. we have not yet completed our accounting for the transition tax as our analysis of deferred foreign income is not complete. to calculate the transition tax, we estimated our deferred foreign income for fiscal year 2018 because these tax returns are not complete or due. fiscal year 2018 taxable income will be known once the respective tax returns are completed and filed. in addition, u.s. and foreign audit settlements may significantly impact the estimated transition tax. the impact of the u.s. and foreign audits on the transition tax will be known as the audits are concluded.  81part ii item 8 \u00a0 in addition, we recorded an estimated $4.2 billion benefit in fiscal year 2018 from the impact of changes in the tax rate, primarily on deferred tax assets and liabilities, which was included in provision for income taxes in our consolidated income statements and deferred income taxes and long-term income taxes in our consolidated balance sheets. we remeasured our deferred taxes to reflect the reduced rate that will apply when these deferred taxes are settled or realized in future periods.  the tcja subjects a u.s. corporation to tax on its gilti. due to the complexity of the new gilti tax rules, we are continuing to evaluate this provision of the tcja and the application of gaap. under gaap, we can make an accounting policy election to either treat taxes due on the gilti inclusion as a current period expense or factor such amounts into our measurement of deferred taxes. we elected the deferred method, and the corresponding deferred tax assets and liabilities are included in the table of deferred income tax assets and liabilities below. on august 1, 2018, the internal revenue service published on its website proposed regulations relating to the transition tax imposed by the tcja. once published in the federal register, the proposed regulations are subject to a 60-day comment period. final regulations are expected to be issued after consideration of comments. we are currently evaluating the impact of the proposed regulations. provision for income taxes the components of the provision for income taxes were as follows:  \u00a0   \u00a0 u.s. and foreign components of income before income taxes were as follows:  \u00a0   \u00a0 82part ii item 8 \u00a0 effective tax rate the items accounting for the difference between income taxes computed at the u.s. federal statutory rate and our effective rate were as follows:  \u00a0   \u00a0 the increase from the federal statutory rate in fiscal year 2018 is primarily due to the net charge related to the enactment of the tcja in the second quarter of fiscal year 2018, offset in part by earnings taxed at lower rates in foreign jurisdictions. the decrease from the federal statutory rate in fiscal year 2017 and 2016 is primarily due to earnings taxed at lower rates in foreign jurisdictions. our foreign regional operating centers in ireland, singapore and puerto rico, which are taxed at rates lower than the u.s. rate, generated 87%, 76%, and 91% of our foreign income before tax in fiscal years 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively. other reconciling items, net consists primarily of tax credits, u.s. state income taxes, and domestic production activities deduction. in fiscal years 2018, 2017, and 2016, there were no individually significant other reconciling items. the increase in our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2018 compared to fiscal year 2017 was primarily due to the net charge related to the enactment of the tcja and the realization of tax benefits attributable to previous phone business losses in fiscal year 2017. the decrease in our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2017 compared to fiscal year 2016 was primarily due to the realization of tax benefits attributable to previous phone business losses, offset in part by changes in the mix of our income before income taxes between the u.s. and foreign countries. 83part ii item 8 \u00a0 the components of the deferred income tax assets and liabilities were as follows: \u00a0 \u00a0   \u00a0 we recorded a deferred tax liability of $7.4 billion related to the recognition of revenue as part of the adoption of the new revenue standard. as of june 30, 2018, we had federal, state and foreign net operating loss carryforwards of $257 million, $1.4 billion and $11.4 billion, respectively. the federal and state net operating loss carryforwards will expire in various years from fiscal 2019 through 2038, if not utilized. the majority of our foreign net operating loss carryforwards do not expire. certain acquired net operating loss carryforwards are subject to an annual limitation, but are expected to be realized with the exception of those which have a valuation allowance. the valuation allowance disclosed in the table above relates to the foreign net operating loss carryforwards and other net deferred tax assets that may not be realized.  deferred income tax balances reflect the effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases and are stated at enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when the taxes are paid or recovered.  income taxes paid, net of refunds, were $5.5 billion, $2.4 billion, and $3.9 billion in fiscal years 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively.  uncertain tax positions  unrecognized tax benefits as of june 30, 2018, 2017, and 2016, were $12.0 billion, $11.7 billion, and $10.2 billion, respectively, and were included in long-term income taxes in our consolidated balance sheets. if recognized, these tax benefits would affect our effective tax rates for fiscal years 2018, 2017, and 2016, by $11.3 billion, $10.2 billion, and $8.8 billion, respectively. 84part ii item 8 \u00a0 as of june 30, 2018, 2017, and 2016, we had accrued interest expense related to uncertain tax positions of $3.0 billion, $2.3 billion, and $1.9 billion, respectively, net of income tax benefits. interest expense on unrecognized tax benefits, net of tax effects, was $688 million, $399 million, and $163 million in fiscal years 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively, and was included in provision for income taxes. the aggregate changes in the balance of unrecognized tax benefits were as follows: \u00a0   \u00a0 while we settled a portion of the irs audit for tax years 2004 to 2006 during the third quarter of fiscal year 2011, and a portion of the irs audit for tax years 2007 to 2009 during the first quarter of fiscal year 2016, we remain under audit for those years. in the second quarter of fiscal year 2018, we settled a portion of the irs audit for tax years 2010 to 2013. we continue to be subject to examination by the irs for tax years 2010 to 2017. in february 2012, the irs withdrew its 2011 revenue agents report for tax years 2004 to 2006 and reopened the audit phase of the examination. as of june 30, 2018, the primary unresolved issue relates to transfer pricing, which could have a significant impact in our consolidated financial statements if not resolved favorably. we believe our allowances for income tax contingencies are adequate. we have not received a proposed assessment for the unresolved issues and do not expect a final resolution of these issues in the next 12 months.\u00a0based on the information currently available, we do not anticipate a significant increase or decrease to our tax contingencies for these issues within the next 12 months.  we are subject to income tax in many jurisdictions outside the u.s. our operations in certain jurisdictions remain subject to examination for tax years 1996 to 2017, some of which are currently under audit by local tax authorities. the resolution of each of these audits is not expected to be material to our consolidated financial statements.  note 14 \u2014 restructuring charges  2016 restructuring  in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016, management approved restructuring plans that resulted in approximately 4,700 job eliminations in fiscal year 2017, primarily across our smartphone hardware business and global sales. in fiscal year 2016, we incurred restructuring charges of $501 million in connection with the 2016 restructuring plans, including severance expenses and other reorganization costs. the actions associated with these restructuring plans were completed as of june 30, 2017. 2017 restructuring  in june 2017, management approved a sales and marketing restructuring plan. in fiscal year 2017, we recorded employee severance expenses of $306 million primarily related to this sales and marketing restructuring plan. the actions associated with this restructuring plan were completed as of june 30, 2018. \u00a0 \u00a0 85part ii item 8 \u00a0 note 15 \u2014 unearned revenue  unearned revenue by segment was as follows:  \u00a0   \u00a0 the opening balance of unearned revenue was $22.2 billion as of july 1, 2016.  changes in unearned revenue were as follows: \u00a0   \u00a0 revenue allocated to remaining performance obligations represents contracted revenue that has not yet been recognized (\u201ccontracted not recognized revenue\u201d), which includes unearned revenue and amounts that will be invoiced and recognized as revenue in future periods. contracted not recognized revenue was $73 billion as of june\u00a030, 2018, of which we expect to recognize approximately 60% of the revenue over the next 12 months and the remainder thereafter. note 16\u00a0\u2014\u00a0leases  we have operating and finance leases for datacenters, corporate offices, research and development facilities, retail stores, and certain equipment. our leases have remaining lease terms of 1 year to 20 years, some of which include options to extend the leases for up to 5 years, and some of which include options to terminate the leases within 1 year.  the components of lease expense were as follows: \u00a0   \u00a0 \u00a0 86part ii item 8 \u00a0 supplemental cash flow information related to leases was as follows: \u00a0   \u00a0 supplemental balance sheet information related to leases was as follows: \u00a0   \u00a0 maturities of lease liabilities were as follows: \u00a0   \u00a0 87part ii item 8 \u00a0 as of june 30, 2018, we have additional operating and finance leases, primarily for datacenters, that have not yet commenced of $594 million and $2.4 billion, respectively. these operating and finance leases will commence between fiscal year 2019 and fiscal year 2020 with lease terms of 1 year to 20 years. note 17 \u2014 contingencies patent and intellectual property claims  there were 34 patent infringement cases pending against microsoft as of june 30, 2018, none of which are material individually or in aggregate.  antitrust, unfair competition, and overcharge class actions  antitrust and unfair competition class action lawsuits were filed against us in british columbia, ontario, and quebec, canada. all three have been certified on behalf of canadian indirect purchasers who acquired licenses for microsoft operating system software and/or productivity application software between 1998 and 2010.  the trial of the british columbia action commenced in may 2016. following a mediation, the parties agreed to a global settlement of all three canadian actions, and have submitted the proposed settlement agreement to the courts in all three jurisdictions for approval. the courts will likely reach a decision on approval in september 2018.  other antitrust litigation and claims  china state administration for industry and commerce investigation  in 2014, microsoft was informed that china\u2019s state agency for market regulation (\u201csamr\u201d) (formerly state administration for industry and commerce) had begun a formal investigation relating to china\u2019s anti-monopoly law, and the samr conducted onsite inspections of microsoft offices in beijing, shanghai, guangzhou, and chengdu.\u00a0samr has stated the investigation relates to compatibility, bundle sales, file verification issues related to windows and office software, and potentially other issues.  product-related litigation  u.s. cell phone litigation  microsoft mobile oy, a subsidiary of microsoft, along with other handset manufacturers and network operators, is a defendant in 35 lawsuits filed in the superior court for the district of columbia by individual plaintiffs who allege that radio emissions from cellular handsets caused their brain tumors and other adverse health effects. we assumed responsibility for these claims in our agreement to acquire nokia\u2019s devices and services business and have been substituted for the nokia defendants. nine of these cases were filed in 2002 and are consolidated for certain pre-trial proceedings; the remaining cases are stayed. in a separate 2009 decision, the court of appeals for the district of columbia held that adverse health effect claims arising from the use of cellular handsets that operate within the u.s. federal communications commission radio frequency emission guidelines (\u201cfcc guidelines\u201d) are pre-empted by federal law. the plaintiffs allege that their handsets either operated outside the fcc guidelines or were manufactured before the fcc guidelines went into effect. the lawsuits also allege an industry-wide conspiracy to manipulate the science and testing around emission guidelines.  in 2013, the defendants in the consolidated cases moved to exclude the plaintiffs\u2019 expert evidence of general causation on the basis of flawed scientific methodologies. in 2014, the trial court granted in part and denied in part the defendants\u2019 motion to exclude the plaintiffs\u2019 general causation experts. the defendants filed an interlocutory appeal challenging the standard for evaluating expert scientific evidence, which the district of columbia court of appeals heard en banc. in october 2016, the court of appeals issued its decision adopting the standard advocated by the defendants and remanding the cases to the trial court for further proceedings under that standard. the plaintiffs have filed supplemental expert evidence, portions of which the defendants have moved to strike.  88part ii item 8 \u00a0 canadian cell phone class action  microsoft mobile oy, along with other handset manufacturers and network operators, is a defendant in a 2013 class action lawsuit filed in the supreme court of british columbia by a purported class of canadians who have used cellular phones for at least 1,600 hours, including a subclass of users with brain tumors, alleging adverse health effects from cellular phone use. microsoft was served with the complaint in june 2014 and has been substituted for the nokia defendants. the litigation has been dormant for more than three years.  employment-related litigation moussouris v. microsoft current and former female microsoft employees in certain engineering and information technology roles brought this class action in federal court in seattle in 2015, alleging systemic gender discrimination in pay and promotions. the plaintiffs moved to certify the class in october 2017. microsoft filed an opposition in january 2018, attaching an expert report showing no statistically significant disparity in pay and promotions between similarly situated men and women. in june 2018, the court denied the plaintiffs\u2019 motion for class certification. the plaintiffs have appealed to the u.s. court of appeals for the ninth circuit. in july, the court denied microsoft\u2019s motion for summary judgment with respect to the named plaintiffs.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 other contingencies  we also are subject to a variety of other claims and suits that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of our business. although management currently believes that resolving claims against us, individually or in aggregate, will not have a material adverse impact in our consolidated financial statements, these matters are subject to inherent uncertainties and management\u2019s view of these matters may change in the future.  as of june 30, 2018, we accrued aggregate legal liabilities of $323 million. while we intend to defend these matters vigorously, adverse outcomes that we estimate could reach approximately $1.1 billion in aggregate beyond recorded amounts are reasonably possible. were unfavorable final outcomes to occur, there exists the possibility of a material adverse impact in our consolidated financial statements for the period in which the effects become reasonably estimable.  indemnifications we provide indemnifications of varying scope and size to certain customers against claims of intellectual property infringement made by third parties arising from the use of our products and certain other matters. additionally, we have agreed to cover damages resulting from breaches of certain security and privacy commitments in our cloud business. in evaluating estimated losses on these obligations, we consider factors such as the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and our ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss. these obligations did not have a material impact in our consolidated financial statements during the periods presented. note

that qualifies under section\u00a0401(k) of the internal revenue code, and a number of savings plans in international locations. participating u.s. employees may contribute a portion of their salary, subject to certain limitations. we contribute fifty cents for each dollar a participant contributes in this plan, with a maximum employer contribution of 50% of the irs contribution limit for the

our segments. however, due to the integrated structure of our business, certain revenue recognized and costs incurred by one segment may benefit other segments. revenue from certain contracts is allocated among the segments based on the relative value of the underlying products and services, which can include allocation based on actual prices charged, prices when sold separately, or estimated costs plus a profit margin. cost of revenue is allocated in certain cases based on a relative revenue methodology. operating expenses that are allocated primarily include those relating to marketing of products and services from which multiple segments benefit and are generally allocated based on relative gross margin.  in addition, certain costs incurred at a corporate level that are identifiable and that benefit our segments are allocated to them. these allocated costs include costs of: legal, including settlements and fines; information technology; human resources; finance; excise taxes; field selling; shared facilities services; and customer service and support. each allocation is measured differently based on the specific facts and circumstances of the costs being allocated. certain corporate-level activity is not allocated to our segments, including impairment and restructuring expenses.  segment revenue and operating income were as follows during the periods

designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. a company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. /s/\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0deloitte\u00a0& touche llp  seattle, washington  august 3, 2018  \u00a0 \u00a0 99", "table": [{}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {"0":

\u00a0 challenges to our business models may reduce our revenue or operating margins.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0whether our software runs in the cloud or on a device, we continue to face challenges from alternative means of developing and licensing software. under our license-based software model, software developers bear the costs of converting original ideas into software products through investments in research and development, offsetting these costs with the revenue received from the distribution of their products. certain \u0093open source\u0094 software business models challenge our license-based software model. open source commonly refers to software whose source code is subject to a license allowing it to be modified, combined with other software and redistributed, subject to restrictions set forth in the license. some companies compete with us using an open source business model by modifying and then distributing open source software to end users at nominal cost and earning revenue on complementary services and products. these firms do not bear the full costs of research and development for the software. in some cases, their products may infringe our patents. in addition, advertising-based business models seek revenue by delivering third party advertisements to end customers who receive the software and services at no direct costs. gains in market acceptance of open source or advertising based software may adversely affect our sales, revenue, and operating margins.  an important element of our business model has been to create platform-based ecosystems on which many participants can build diverse solutions. a competing vertically-integrated model, in which a single firm controls both the software and hardware elements of a product, has been successful with certain consumer products such as personal computers, mobile phones, and digital music players. we also offer vertically-integrated hardware and software products; however, efforts to compete with the vertically integrated model may increase our cost of sales and reduce our operating margins.  we derive substantial revenue from licenses of windows operating systems on personal computers. the proliferation of alternative devices and form factors creates challenges from competing software platforms. it is uncertain to what extent alternative devices will increase the number of computing devices that users own, or will substitute for users\u0092 personal computer purchases. alternative devices also run operating systems and applications developed by our competitors. these factors could impact our revenue and margins.  we face intense competition.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0we continue to experience intense competition across all markets for our products and services. our competitors range in size from fortune 100 companies to small, specialized single-product businesses and open source community-based projects. although we believe the breadth of our businesses and product portfolio is a competitive advantage, our competitors that are focused on narrower product lines may be more effective in devoting technical, marketing, and financial resources to compete with us. in addition, barriers to entry in our businesses generally are low and products, once developed, can be distributed broadly and quickly at relatively low cost. open source software vendors are devoting considerable efforts to developing software that mimics the features and functionality of our products, in some cases in violation of our intellectual property rights or on the basis of technical specifications for microsoft technologies that we make available at little or no cost in connection with our interoperability initiatives. in response to competition, we continue to develop versions of our products with basic functionality that are sold at lower prices than the standard versions. these competitive pressures may result in decreased sales volumes, price reductions, and/or increased operating costs, such as for marketing and sales incentives, resulting in lower revenue, gross margins, and operating income.  we may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property rights.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0protecting our global intellectual property rights and combating unlicensed copying and use of software and other intellectual property is difficult. while piracy adversely affects u.s. revenue, the impact on revenue from outside the u.s. is more significant, particularly in countries where laws are less protective of intellectual property rights. as a result, our revenue in these markets likely will grow slower than the underlying pc market. similarly, the absence of harmonized patent laws makes it more difficult to ensure consistent respect for patent rights. throughout the world, we actively educate consumers about the benefits of licensing genuine products and obtaining indemnification benefits for intellectual property risks, and we educate lawmakers about the advantages of a business climate where intellectual property rights are protected. however, continued educational and enforcement efforts may fail to enhance revenue. reductions in the legal protection for software intellectual property rights could adversely affect revenue.  third parties may claim we infringe their intellectual property rights.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0from time to time, we receive notices from others claiming we infringe their intellectual property rights. because of constant technological change in the  \u00a0 15  table of contents  \u00a0  part i  item 1a  \u00a0 \u00a0  segments in which we compete, the extensive patent coverage of existing technologies, and the rapid rate of issuance of new patents, it is possible the number of these claims may grow. to resolve these claims we may enter into royalty and licensing agreements on less favorable terms, stop selling or redesign affected products, or pay damages to satisfy indemnification commitments with our customers. such agreements may cause operating margins to decline. we have made and expect to continue making significant expenditures to settle claims related to the use of technology and intellectual property rights as part of our strategy to manage this risk.  we may not be able to protect our source code from copying if there is an unauthorized disclosure of source code.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0source code, the detailed program commands for our operating systems and other software programs, is critical to our business. although we license portions of our application and operating system source code to a number of licensees, we take significant measures to protect the secrecy of large portions of our source code. if an unauthorized disclosure of a significant portion of our source code occurs, we could potentially lose future trade secret protection for that source code. this could make it easier for third parties to compete with our products by copying functionality, which could adversely affect our revenue and operating margins. unauthorized disclosure of source code also could increase the security risks described in the next paragraph.  security vulnerabilities could lead to reduced revenue, liability claims, or competitive harm.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0maintaining the security of computers and computer networks is paramount for us and our customers. hackers develop and deploy viruses, worms, and other malicious software programs that attack our products and services and gain access to our networks and data centers. although this is an industry-wide problem that affects computers across all platforms, it affects our products and services in particular because hackers tend to focus their efforts on the most popular operating systems, programs, and services, and we expect them to continue to do so. groups of hackers may also act in a coordinated manner to launch distributed denial of service attacks, or other coordinated attacks, that may cause service outages or other interruptions. we devote significant resources to address security vulnerabilities through:  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 the cost of these steps could reduce our operating margins. despite these efforts, actual or perceived security vulnerabilities in our products and services could cause significant reputational harm and lead some customers to seek to return products, to reduce or delay future purchases or adoption of services, or to use competing products. customers may also increase their expenditures on protecting their existing computer systems from attack, which could delay adoption of new technologies. any of these actions by customers could adversely affect our revenue. actual or perceived vulnerabilities may lead to claims against us. although our license agreements typically contain provisions that eliminate or limit our exposure to such liability, there is no assurance these provisions will withstand all legal challenges.  in addition, our internal information technology environment continues to evolve. we are often early adopters of new devices and technologies. we embrace new ways of sharing data and communicating with partners and customers using methods such as social networking. these practices can enhance efficiency and business insight, but they also present risks that our business policies and internal security controls may not keep pace with the speed of these changes. if third parties gain access to our networks or data centers, they could obtain and exploit confidential business information and harm our competitive position.  \u00a0 16  table of contents  \u00a0  part i  item 1a  \u00a0 \u00a0 improper disclosure of personal data could result in liability and harm our reputation.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0as we continue to execute our strategy of increasing the number and scale of our cloud-based offerings, we store and process increasingly large amounts of personally identifiable information of our customers. at the same time, the continued occurrence of high-profile data breaches provides evidence of an external environment increasingly hostile to information security. this environment demands that we continuously improve our design and coordination of security controls across our business groups and geographies. despite these efforts, it is possible our security controls over personal data, our training of employees and vendors on data security, and other practices we follow may not prevent the improper disclosure of personally identifiable information. improper disclosure of this information could harm our reputation, lead to legal exposure to customers, or subject us to liability under laws that protect personal data, resulting in increased costs or loss of revenue. our software products and services also enable our customers to store and process personal data on premises or, increasingly, in a cloud-based environment we host. we believe consumers using our email, messaging, storage, sharing, and social networking services will increasingly want efficient, centralized methods of choosing their privacy preferences and controlling their data. perceptions that our products or services do not adequately protect the privacy of personal information could inhibit sales of our products or services, and could constrain consumer and business adoption of cloud-based solutions.  we may experience outages, data loss and disruptions of our online services if we fail to maintain an adequate operations infrastructure.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0our increasing user traffic and complexity of our products and services demand more computing power. we have spent and expect to continue to spend substantial amounts to purchase or lease data centers and equipment and to upgrade our technology and network infrastructure to handle increased traffic on our web sites and in our data centers, and to introduce new products and services and support existing services such as bing, exchange online, office 365, sharepoint online, xbox live, windows azure, windows live, and microsoft office web apps. we also are growing our business of providing a platform and back-end hosting for services provided by third-party businesses to their end customers. maintaining and expanding this infrastructure is expensive and complex. inefficiencies or operational failures, including temporary or permanent loss of customer data, could diminish the quality of our products, services, and user experience resulting in contractual liability, claims by customers and other third parties, damage to our reputation and loss of current and potential users, subscribers, and advertisers, each of which may harm our operating results and financial condition.  we are subject to government litigation and regulatory activity that affects how we design and market our products.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0as a leading global software maker, we receive close scrutiny from government agencies under u.s. and foreign competition laws. some jurisdictions also provide private rights of action for competitors or consumers to assert claims of anti-competitive conduct. for example, we have been involved in the following actions.  lawsuits brought by the u.s. department of justice, 18 states, and the district of columbia in two separate actions were resolved through a consent decree that took effect in 2001 and a final judgment entered in 2002. these proceedings imposed various constraints on our windows operating system businesses. these constraints included limits on certain contracting practices, mandated disclosure of certain software program interfaces and protocols, and rights for computer manufacturers to limit the visibility of certain windows features in new pcs. although the consent decree and final judgment expired in may 2011, we expect that federal and state antitrust authorities will continue to closely scrutinize our business.  the european commission closely scrutinizes the design of high-volume microsoft products and the terms on which we make certain technologies used in these products, such as file formats, programming interfaces, and protocols, available to other companies. in 2004, the commission ordered us to create new versions of windows that do not include certain multimedia technologies and to provide our competitors with specifications for how to implement certain proprietary windows communications protocols in their own products. in 2009, the commission accepted a set of commitments offered by microsoft to address the commission\u0092s concerns relating to competition in web browsing software. the commission\u0092s impact on product design may limit our ability to innovate in windows or other products in the future, diminish the developer appeal of the windows platform, and increase our product development costs. the availability of licenses related to protocols and file formats may enable competitors to develop software products that better mimic the functionality of our own products which could result in decreased sales of our\u00a0products.  \u00a0 17  table of contents  \u00a0  part i  item 1a  \u00a0 \u00a0 government regulatory actions and court decisions such as these may hinder our ability to provide the benefits of our software to consumers and businesses, thereby reducing the attractiveness of our products and the revenue that come from them. new actions could be initiated at any time, either by these or other governments or private claimants, including with respect to new versions of windows or other microsoft products. the outcome of such actions, or steps taken to avoid them, could adversely affect us in a variety of ways, including:  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 our software and services online offerings are subject to government regulation of the internet domestically and internationally in many areas, including user privacy, telecommunications, data protection, and online content. the application of these laws and regulations to our business is often unclear and sometimes may conflict. compliance with these regulations may involve significant costs or require changes in business practices that result in reduced revenue. noncompliance could result in penalties being imposed on us or orders that we stop the alleged noncompliant activity.  our business depends on our ability to attract and retain talented employees.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0our business is based on successfully attracting and retaining talented employees. the market for highly skilled workers and leaders in our industry is extremely competitive. we are limited in our ability to recruit internationally by restrictive domestic immigration laws. if we are less successful in our recruiting efforts, or if we are unable to retain key employees, our ability to develop and deliver successful products and services may be adversely affected. effective succession planning is also important to our long-term success. failure to ensure effective transfer of knowledge and smooth transitions involving key employees could hinder our strategic planning and execution.  delays in product development schedules may adversely affect our revenue.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0the development of software products is a complex and time-consuming process. new products and enhancements to existing products can require long development and testing periods. our increasing focus on cloud-based software plus services also presents new and complex development issues. significant delays in new product or service releases or significant problems in creating new products or services could adversely affect our revenue.  we make significant investments in new products and services that may not be profitable.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0our growth depends on our ability to innovate by offering new, and adding value to our existing, software and service offerings. we will continue to make significant investments in research, development, and marketing for new products, services, and technologies, including the windows pc operating system, the microsoft office system, bing, windows phone, windows server, windows live, the windows azure services platform and other cloud-based services offerings, and the xbox 360 entertainment platform. investments in new technology are speculative. commercial success depends on many factors, including innovativeness, developer support, and effective distribution and marketing. our degree of success with windows phone, for example, will impact our ability to grow our share of the smartphone operating system market. it will also be an important factor in supporting our strategy of delivering value to end users seamlessly over pc, phone, and tv device classes. if customers do not perceive our latest offerings as providing significant new functionality or other value, they may reduce their purchases of new software products or upgrades, unfavorably impacting revenue. we may not achieve significant revenue from new product and service investments for a number of years, if at all. moreover, new products and services may not be profitable, and even if they are profitable, operating margins for new products and businesses may not be as high as the margins we have experienced historically.  adverse economic conditions may harm our business.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0unfavorable changes in economic conditions, including inflation, recession, or other changes in economic conditions, may result in lower information technology spending and adversely affect our revenue. if demand for pcs, servers, and other computing devices declines, or consumer or  \u00a0 18  table of contents  \u00a0  part i  item 1a  \u00a0 \u00a0  business spending for those products declines, our revenue will be adversely affected.\u00a0our product distribution system also relies on an extensive partner network. the impact of economic conditions on our partners, such as the bankruptcy of a major distributor, could result in sales channel disruption. challenging economic conditions also may impair the ability of our customers to pay for products and services they have purchased. as a result, reserves for doubtful accounts and write-offs of accounts receivable may increase. we maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings, types, and maturities. these investments are subject to general credit, liquidity, market, and interest rate risks, which may be exacerbated by unusual events that have affected global financial markets. a significant part of our investment portfolio consists of u.s. government securities. if global credit and equity markets experience prolonged periods of decline, or if the u.s. federal government budget process results in a default or downgrade of its debt, our investment portfolio may be adversely impacted and we could determine that more of our investments have experienced an other-than-temporary decline in fair value, requiring impairment charges that could adversely impact our financial results.  we have claims and lawsuits against us that may result in adverse outcomes.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0we are subject to a variety of claims and lawsuits. adverse outcomes in some or all of these claims may result in significant monetary damages or injunctive relief that could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business. although management currently believes resolving all of these matters, individually or in the aggregate, will not have a material adverse impact on our financial statements, the litigation and other claims are subject to inherent uncertainties and management\u0092s view of these matters may change in the future. a material adverse impact on our financial statements also could occur for the period in which the effect of an unfavorable final outcome becomes probable and reasonably estimable.  we may have additional tax liabilities.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0we are subject to income taxes in the u.s. and many foreign jurisdictions. significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes. in the ordinary course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. we regularly are under audit by tax authorities. although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals. the results of an audit or litigation could have a material effect on our financial statements in the period or periods for which that determination is made.  we earn a significant amount of our operating income from outside the u.s., and any repatriation of funds currently held in foreign jurisdictions may result in higher effective tax rates for the company. in addition, there have been proposals to change u.s. tax laws that would significantly impact how u.s. multinational corporations are taxed on foreign earnings.\u00a0although we cannot predict whether or in what form this proposed legislation may pass, if enacted it could have a material adverse impact on our tax expense and cash flow.  our vertically-integrated hardware and software products may experience quality or supply problems.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0our hardware products such as the xbox 360 console are highly complex and can have defects in design, manufacture, or associated software. we could incur significant expenses, lost revenue, and reputational harm if we fail to detect or effectively address such issues through design, testing, or warranty repairs. we obtain some components of our hardware devices from sole suppliers. if a component delivery from a sole-source supplier is delayed or becomes unavailable or industry shortages occur, we may be unable to obtain timely replacement supplies, resulting in reduced sales. either component shortages or excess or obsolete inventory may increase our cost of revenue. xbox 360 consoles are assembled in asia; disruptions in the supply chain may result in console shortages that would affect our revenue and operating margins. these same risks would apply to any other vertically-integrated hardware and software products we may offer.  if our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets become impaired we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states (\u0093u.s. gaap\u0094), we review our amortizable intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually. factors that may be considered a change in circumstances, indicating that the carrying value of our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets may not be recoverable, include a decline in stock price and market capitalization, reduced future cash flow estimates, and slower growth rates in our industry. we may be required to record a significant charge in our financial statements during the period in which any impairment of our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets is determined, negatively impacting our results of operations.  \u00a0 19  table of contents  \u00a0  part ii  item 7  \u00a0 \u00a0 industry trends  our industry is dynamic and highly competitive, with frequent changes in both technologies and business models. each industry shift is an opportunity to conceive new products, new technologies, or new ideas which can further transform the industry and our business. at microsoft, we push the boundaries of what is possible through a broad set of research and technology innovations that seek to anticipate the changing demands of customers, industry trends, and competitive forces.  key opportunities and investments  based on our assessment of key technology trends and our broad focus on long-term research and development of new products and services, we see significant opportunities to drive future growth.  smart connected devices  the price per unit of processing, storage, and networks continues to decline while at the same time devices increase in capability. this ongoing trend is increasing the capabilities of pcs, mobile, and other devices powered by rich software platforms and applications. at the same time, the information and services people use increasingly span multiple devices. user experiences will be transformed by the adoption of cloud computing when brought together with the richness of smart, connected devices. microsoft is delivering experiences that seamlessly connect pcs and mobile and other devices through the cloud. we are devoting significant resources to consumer cloud offerings like bing, windows live, and xbox live. our software and hardware platform investments can be seen in products like kinect, windows, windows azure, windows phone, windows server, and xbox.  cloud computing transforming the data center and information technology  cloud-based solutions provide customers with software, services and content over the internet by way of shared computing resources located in centralized data centers. computing is undergoing a long-term shift from client/server to the cloud, a shift similar in importance and impact to the transition from mainframe to client/server. the shift to the cloud is driven by three important economies of scale: larger data centers can deploy computational resources at significantly lower cost than smaller ones; larger data centers include diverse customer, geographic, and application demand patterns which improve the utilization of computing, storage, and network resources; and multi-tenancy lowers application maintenance labor costs for large public clouds. as a result of the improved economics, the cloud offers unique levels of elasticity and agility that will enable new solutions and applications. for businesses of all sizes, the cloud creates the opportunity to focus more on innovation while leaving non-differentiating activities to reliable and cost-effective providers. for most businesses, the first step in achieving cloud economics is the adoption of virtualization in their data center. we are devoting significant resources to developing cloud infrastructure, platforms, and applications including offerings such as microsoft dynamics online, microsoft sql azure, office 365, windows azure, windows intune, and windows server.  entertainment  the evolution of hardware, software, services, and the cloud are enhancing the delivery and quality of unified entertainment experiences across many devices. these rich media experiences include games, movies, music, television, and social interactions with family, friends, and colleagues. at microsoft, our approach is to simplify and increase the accessibility of these entertainment experiences to broaden market penetration of our software and services. we invest significant resources in partnerships, content, windows phone, xbox, and xbox live.  search  over the last two decades, web content and social connections have increased dramatically as people spend more time online, while discoverability and accessibility has been transforming from direct navigation and document links. there is significant opportunity to deliver differentiated products that helps users make better decisions and  \u00a0 23  table of contents  \u00a0  part ii  item 7  \u00a0 \u00a0  complete tasks more simply when using pc, mobile, and other devices. our approach is to use machine learning to try to understand user intent, and differentiate our product by focusing on the integration of visual, social, and other elements which simplifies people\u0092s interaction with the internet. we invest significant resources in bing, sharepoint, windows, and windows phone.  communications and productivity  personal and business productivity has been transformed by the ubiquity of computing and software tools. over the last decade, microsoft redefined software productivity beyond the rich office client on the pc. productivity scenarios now encompass unified communications, business intelligence, collaboration, content management, and relationship management, which are increasingly powered by server-side applications. these server applications can be hosted by the customer, a partner, or by microsoft in the cloud. there are significant opportunities to provide productivity and communication scenarios across pcs, mobile devices, and other devices that connect to services. we invest significant resources in dynamics, exchange, lync, office, office 365, sharepoint, and windows live.  economic conditions, challenges and risks  as discussed above, our industry is dynamic and highly competitive. we must anticipate changes in technology and business models. our model for growth is based on our ability to initiate and embrace disruptive technology trends, to enter new markets, both in terms of geographies and product areas, and to drive broad adoption of the products and services we develop and market.  at microsoft, we prioritize our investments among the highest long-term growth opportunities. these investments require significant resources and are multi-year in nature. the products and services we bring to market can be built internally, brought to market as part of a partnership or alliance, or through acquisition.  our success is highly dependent on our ability to attract and retain qualified employees. we rely on hiring from a mix of university and industry talent worldwide. microsoft competes for talented individuals worldwide by offering broad customer reach, scale in resources, and competitive compensation.  demand for our software, services, and hardware has a strong correlation to global macroeconomic factors. the current macroeconomic factors remain dynamic.\u00a0see a discussion of these factors and other risks under risk factors (part 1, item\u00a01a. of this form 10-k).  seasonality  our revenue historically has fluctuated quarterly and has generally been the highest in the second quarter of our fiscal year due to corporate calendar year-end spending trends in our major markets and holiday season spending by consumers. our entertainment and devices division is particularly seasonal as its products are aimed at the consumer market and are in highest demand during the holiday shopping season. typically, the entertainment and devices division has generated approximately 40% of its yearly segment revenue in our second fiscal quarter. in addition, quarterly revenue may be impacted by the deferral of revenue. see the discussions below regarding sales of earlier versions of the microsoft office system with a guarantee to be upgraded to the newest version of the microsoft office system at minimal or no cost (the \u0093office deferral\u0094) and sales of windows vista with a guarantee to be upgraded to windows 7 at minimal or no cost and of windows 7 to retailers before general availability (the \u0093windows 7 deferral\u0094).  \u00a0 24  table of contents  \u00a0  part ii  item 7  \u00a0 \u00a0 results of operations  summary of results for fiscal years 2011, 2010, and 2009  \u00a0  fiscal year 2011 compared with fiscal year 2010  revenue increased primarily due to strong sales of the xbox 360 entertainment platform, the 2010 microsoft office system, and server and tools products, offset in part by lower windows revenue. revenue also increased due to the $254 million office deferral in fiscal year 2010 and the subsequent recognition of the office deferral during fiscal year 2011. changes in foreign currency exchange rates had an insignificant impact on revenue.  operating income increased reflecting the change in revenue, offset in part by higher operating expenses. key changes in operating expenses were:  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 diluted earnings per share increased reflecting higher revenue, repurchases of common stock, and lower income tax expense, offset in part by higher operating expenses.  fiscal year 2010 compared with fiscal year 2009  revenue increased mainly due to strong sales of windows 7, which was released during fiscal year 2010, and pc market improvement. operating income increased reflecting the change in revenue, offset in part by higher operating expenses.  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 25  table of contents  \u00a0  part ii  item 7  \u00a0 \u00a0 diluted earnings per

income (loss) amounts in this section are presented on a basis consistent with accounting principles generally accepted in the u.s. (\u0093u.s. gaap\u0094) and include certain reconciling items attributable to each of the segments. segment information appearing in note 21 \u0096 segment information and geographic data of the notes to financial statements (part ii, item\u00a08 of this form 10-k) is presented on a basis consistent with our current internal management reporting. certain corporate-level activity has been excluded from segment operating results and is analyzed separately.  we have recast certain prior period amounts within this md&a to conform to the way we internally managed and monitored segment performance during the current fiscal year, including moving microsoft\u0092s pc hardware business from entertainment and devices division to windows\u00a0& windows live division, windows embedded from entertainment and devices division to server and tools, and office for mac from entertainment and devices division to microsoft business division, as well as implementing intersegment cost allocations between all segments related to the collaborative investment in mobile platform development.  windows\u00a0& windows live division  \u00a0  windows\u00a0& windows live division (\u0093windows division\u0094) develops and markets pc operating systems, related software and online services, and pc hardware products. this collection of software, hardware, and services is designed to simplify everyday tasks through efficient browsing capabilities and seamless operations across the user\u0092s hardware and software. windows division offerings consist of multiple editions of the windows operating system, software and services through windows live, and microsoft pc hardware products.  windows division revenue is largely correlated to the pc market worldwide, as approximately 75% of total windows division revenue comes from windows operating system software purchased by original equipment manufacturers (\u0093oems\u0094) which they pre-install on equipment they sell. the remaining approximately 25% of windows division revenue (\u0093other revenue\u0094) is generated by commercial and retail sales of windows and pc hardware products and online advertising from windows live.  fiscal year 2011 compared with fiscal year 2010  windows division revenue reflected relative performance in\u00a0pc market segments.\u00a0we estimate that sales of pcs to businesses grew approximately 11% this year and sales of pcs to consumers declined approximately 1%.\u00a0the decline in consumer pc sales included an approximately 32% decline in the sales of netbooks. taken together, the\u00a0total pc market\u00a0increased an estimated 2%\u00a0to 4%. revenue was negatively impacted by the effect of higher growth in emerging markets, where average selling prices are lower, relative to developed markets, and by lower recognition of previously deferred windows xp revenue.\u00a0considering the impact of windows 7 launch in the prior year, including $273 million of revenue recognized related to the windows 7 deferral, we estimate that windows division revenue was in line with the pc market.  windows division operating income decreased as a result of decreased revenue and higher sales and marketing expenses. sales and marketing expenses increased $224 million or 8% reflecting increased advertising of windows and windows live.  \u00a0 26  table of contents  \u00a0  part ii  item 7  \u00a0 \u00a0 fiscal year 2010 compared with fiscal year 2009  windows division revenue increased primarily as a result of strong sales of windows 7 and pc market improvement. we estimate total pc shipments from all sources grew approximately 16% to 18%. oem revenue increased $2.6 billion or 22%, while oem license units increased 21%. the oem revenue increase was driven by pc market growth, higher windows attach rates across consumer and business segments, the restoration of normal oem inventory levels, and the mix of versions of windows licensed, offset in part by pc market changes, including stronger growth of emerging markets versus developed markets and of consumer pcs versus business pcs. fiscal year 2009 oem revenue reflects a $273 million windows 7 deferral. this amount was subsequently recognized in fiscal year 2010. other revenue increased $970 million or 26% driven primarily by windows 7 retail sales.  windows division operating income increased as a result of increased revenue, offset in part by higher operating expenses. sales and marketing expenses increased $258 million or 11% reflecting increased advertising and marketing of windows 7. cost of revenue increased $251 million or 14%, primarily driven by traffic acquisition costs and royalties.  server and tools  \u00a0  server and tools develops and markets technology and related services that enable information technology professionals and their systems to be more productive and efficient. server and tools product and service offerings include windows server, microsoft sql server, windows azure, visual studio, system center products, windows embedded device platforms, and enterprise services. enterprise services comprise premier product support services and microsoft consulting services. we also offer developer tools, training and certification. approximately 50% of server and tools revenue comes primarily from multi-year volume licensing agreements, approximately 30% is purchased through transactional volume licensing programs, retail packaged product and licenses sold to oems, and the remainder comes from enterprise services.  fiscal year 2011 compared with fiscal year 2010  server and tools revenue increased reflecting growth in both product sales and enterprise services. product revenue increased $1.4 billion or 11%, driven primarily by growth in windows server, sql server, enterprise cal\u00a0suites, and windows embedded, reflecting continued adoption of windows platform applications. enterprise services revenue grew $337 million or 11%, due to growth in both premier product support and consulting services.  server and tools operating income increased due to revenue growth, offset in part by higher operating expenses. cost of revenue increased $366 million or 13%, primarily reflecting a $323 million increase in expenses from providing enterprise services. sales and marketing expenses increased $264 million or 6% reflecting increased fees paid to third party enterprise software advisors and increased corporate marketing activities.  fiscal year 2010 compared with fiscal year 2009  server and tools revenue increased mainly reflecting growth in product revenue. product revenue increased $784 million or 7%, driven primarily by growth in windows server, sql server and enterprise cal suites revenue, reflecting increased revenue from annuity volume licensing agreements and continued adoption of windows platform applications, offset in part by a decline in developer tools revenue. enterprise services revenue was relatively flat, with growth in premier product support services nearly offset by decreased consulting services.  \u00a0 27  table of contents  \u00a0  part ii  item 7  \u00a0 \u00a0 server and tools operating income increased due mainly to revenue growth, offset in part by increased cost of revenue. cost of revenue increased $65 million or 2%, reflecting increased headcount-related expenses and hosting costs.  online services division  \u00a0  online services division (\u0093osd\u0094) develops and markets information and content designed to help people simplify tasks and make more informed decisions online, and that help advertisers connect with audiences. osd offerings include bing, msn, adcenter, and advertiser tools. bing and msn generate revenue through the sale of search and display advertising. search and display advertising generally accounts for nearly all of osd\u0092s annual revenue.  fiscal year 2011 compared with fiscal year 2010  osd revenue increased primarily as a result of growth in online advertising revenue. online advertising revenue grew $358 million or 19% to $2.3 billion, reflecting continued growth in search and display advertising revenue, offset in part by decreased third party advertising revenue. search revenue grew due to increased volumes reflecting general market growth, relative share gains in the u.s., and our yahoo! alliance, offset in part by decreased revenue per search primarily related to challenges associated with optimizing the adcenter platform for the new mix and volume of traffic from the combined yahoo! and bing properties. as of june\u00a030, 2011, according to third-party sources, bing organic u.s. market share grew over 31% to approximately 14%, while bing-powered u.s. market share, including yahoo! properties, was approximately 27%.  osd operating loss increased due to higher operating expenses, offset in part by increased revenue. cost of revenue grew $641 million driven by costs associated with the yahoo! search agreement and increased traffic acquisition costs. general and administrative expenses decreased $157 million or 60% due mainly to transition expenses in the prior year associated with the inception of the yahoo! commercial agreement. research and development increased $117 million or 11% due to increased headcount-related costs.  fiscal year 2010 compared with fiscal year 2009  osd revenue increased reflecting increased online advertising revenue, offset in part by decreased access (dial-up internet) revenue. online advertising revenue increased $146 million or 8% to $1.9 billion, reflecting higher search and display advertising revenue, offset in part by decreased advertiser and publisher tools revenue. access revenue decreased $57 million or 31%, reflecting continued migration of subscribers to broadband or other competitively-priced service providers.  osd operating loss increased due to increased operating expenses, offset in part by increased revenue. cost of revenue increased $567 million, primarily driven by higher online traffic acquisition costs and yahoo! reimbursement and implementation costs. general and administrative expenses increased $135 million. sales and marketing expenses increased $51 million or 5% due mainly to increased marketing of bing, offset in part by decreased headcount-related expenses.  microsoft business division  \u00a0  \u00a0 28  table of contents  \u00a0  part ii  item 7  \u00a0 \u00a0 microsoft business division (\u0093mbd\u0094) develops and markets software and services designed to increase personal, team, and organization productivity. mbd offerings include the microsoft office system (comprising mainly office, sharepoint, exchange and lync), which generates over 90% of mbd revenue, and microsoft dynamics business solutions. we evaluate mbd results based upon the nature of the end user in two primary parts: business revenue, which includes microsoft office system revenue generated through volume licensing agreements and microsoft dynamics revenue; and consumer revenue, which includes revenue from retail packaged product sales and oem revenue.  fiscal year 2011 compared with fiscal year 2010  mbd revenue increased primarily reflecting sales of the 2010 microsoft office system, the $254 million office deferral during fiscal year 2010, and the subsequent recognition of the office deferral during fiscal year 2011. business revenue increased $2.0\u00a0billion or 13%, reflecting licensing of the 2010 microsoft office system to transactional business customers, growth in multi-year volume licensing revenue, and a 10% increase in microsoft dynamics revenue. consumer revenue increased $1.1 billion or 33%, approximately half of which was attributable to the launch of office 2010 and half of which was attributable to the office deferral during fiscal year 2010 and subsequent recognition of the office deferral during fiscal year 2011. excluding the impact associated with the office deferral, consumer revenue increased $620 million or 17% due to sales of the 2010 microsoft office system.  mbd operating income increased due mainly to revenue growth, offset in part by higher operating expenses. cost of revenue increased $335 million or 26%, primarily driven by higher online costs and services. sales and marketing expenses increased $97 million or 2%, primarily driven by an increase in corporate and cross-platform marketing activities. research and development costs increased $79 million or 4%, primarily as a result of capitalization of certain microsoft office system software development costs in the prior year.  fiscal year 2010 compared with fiscal year 2009  mbd revenue decreased primarily as a result of the net deferral of $254 million of revenue related to the office 2010 deferral. consumer revenue decreased $142 million or 4%, primarily due to the office 2010 deferral, offset in part by growth in the pc market and sales of the 2010 microsoft office system, which was launched during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2010. business revenue decreased $39 million, primarily reflecting a decline in licensing of the 2007 microsoft office system to transactional business customers, offset in part by growth in multi-year volume licensing agreement revenue and licensing of the 2010 microsoft office system to transactional business customers. microsoft dynamics revenue was flat.  mbd operating income increased due mainly to decreased operating expenses, offset in part by decreased revenue. sales and marketing expenses decreased $203 million or 5%, primarily driven by a decrease in corporate marketing activities. research and development expenses decreased $202 million or 9%, primarily as a result of capitalization of certain microsoft office system software development costs and lower headcount-related expenses. general and administrative expenses decreased $50 million or 17% primarily due to expenses in the prior year associated with the acquisition of fast search\u00a0& transfer asa (\u0093fast\u0094) and lower headcount-related expenses. these decreases were offset in part by a $135 million or 12% increase in cost of revenue, primarily driven by increased traffic acquisition costs and increased costs of providing services.  entertainment and devices division  \u00a0  \u00a0 29  table of contents  \u00a0  part ii  item 7  \u00a0 \u00a0 entertainment and devices division (\u0093edd\u0094) develops and markets products and services designed to entertain and connect people. edd offerings include the xbox 360 entertainment platform (which includes the xbox 360 gaming and entertainment console, kinect for xbox 360, xbox 360 video games, xbox live, and xbox 360 accessories), mediaroom (our internet protocol television software), and windows phone. in november 2010, we released kinect for xbox 360 and the latest version of windows phone.  fiscal year 2011 compared with fiscal year 2010  edd revenue increased primarily reflecting higher xbox 360 platform revenue. xbox 360 platform revenue grew $2.7 billion or 48%, led by increased volumes of xbox 360 consoles, sales of kinect sensors, and higher xbox live revenue. we shipped 13.7\u00a0million xbox 360 consoles during fiscal year 2011, compared with 10.3\u00a0million xbox 360 consoles during fiscal year 2010.  edd operating income increased primarily reflecting revenue growth, offset in part by higher cost of revenue. cost of revenue increased $1.8 billion or 49% primarily reflecting higher volumes of xbox 360 consoles and kinect sensors sold, and increased royalty costs resulting from increased sales of xbox live digital content. research and development expenses increased $119 million or 12%, primarily reflecting higher headcount-related costs. sales and marketing expenses grew $90 million or 12% primarily reflecting increased xbox 360 platform marketing activities.  fiscal year 2010 compared with fiscal year 2009  edd revenue decreased reflecting decreased revenue from xbox 360 platform and pc games. xbox 360 platform and pc game revenue decreased $12 million, primarily reflecting a reduction in xbox 360 consoles sold and revenue per console, offset in part by increased xbox live revenue. we shipped 10.3\u00a0million xbox 360 consoles during fiscal year 2010, compared with 11.2\u00a0million xbox 360 consoles during fiscal year 2009. non-gaming revenue decreased $197 million or 25% primarily reflecting decreased zune and windows phone revenue.  edd operating income increased due to reduced operating expenses. cost of revenue decreased $496 million or 12%, primarily due to lower xbox 360 console costs, offset in part by increased royalty costs resulting from increased xbox live digital marketplace third-party content sales and charges resulting from the discontinuation of the kin phone. sales and marketing costs decreased $75 million or 9%, primarily due to decreased xbox 360 platform marketing activities. research and development expenses increased $54 million or 6%, primarily reflecting increased headcount-related expenses, offset in part by decreased third-party development and programming costs.  corporate-level activity  \u00a0  certain corporate-level activity is not allocated to our segments, including costs of: broad-based sales and marketing; product support services; human resources; legal; finance; information technology; corporate development and procurement activities; research and development; and legal settlements and contingencies.  fiscal year 2011 compared with fiscal year 2010  corporate-level expenses increased due mainly to new puerto rican excise taxes, certain revenue related sales and marketing expenses, and increased headcount-related expenses. these increases were offset in part by lower legal charges, which were $332 million in fiscal year 2011 compared to $533 million in fiscal year 2010.  \u00a0 30  table of contents  \u00a0  part ii  item 7  \u00a0 \u00a0 fiscal year 2010 compared with fiscal year 2009  corporate-level expenses decreased due mainly to employee severance charges of $330 million incurred in the prior year, decreased partner payments, and reductions in other costs due to resource management efforts. these decreases in expenses were offset in part by an increase in legal charges and costs associated with broad-based sales and marketing activities. legal charges were approximately $533 million compared to $283 million in the prior year.  operating expenses  cost of revenue  \u00a0  cost of revenue includes: manufacturing and distribution costs for products sold and programs licensed; operating costs related to product support service centers and product distribution centers; costs incurred to include software on pcs sold by oems, to drive traffic to our web sites, and to acquire online advertising space (\u0093traffic acquisition costs\u0094); costs incurred to support and maintain internet-based products and services, including royalties; warranty costs; inventory valuation adjustments; costs associated with the delivery of consulting services; and the amortization of capitalized research and development costs.  fiscal year 2011 compared with fiscal year 2010  cost of revenue increased primarily due to increased volumes of xbox 360 consoles and kinect sensors sold, higher costs associated with our online offerings, including traffic acquisition costs, and higher expenses from providing enterprise services, as well as royalty costs relating to xbox live digital content sold.  fiscal year 2010 compared with fiscal year 2009  cost of revenue increased reflecting higher online costs, mainly yahoo! reimbursement and implementation costs and traffic acquisition costs, as well as increased royalty costs resulting from increased xbox live digital marketplace third-party content sales and charges resulting from the discontinuation of the kin phone. for the current fiscal year, these costs were offset in part by lower xbox 360 console costs and reductions in other costs due to resource management efforts.  research and development  \u00a0  research and development expenses include payroll, employee benefits, stock-based compensation expense, and other headcount-related expenses associated with product development. research and development expenses also include third-party development and programming costs, localization costs incurred to translate software for international markets, and the amortization of purchased software code and services content.  fiscal year 2011 compared with fiscal year 2010  research and development expenses increased primarily due to a 5% increase in headcount-related expenses and the capitalization of certain software development costs in the prior year.  \u00a0 31  table of contents  \u00a0  part ii  item 7  \u00a0 \u00a0 fiscal year 2010 compared with fiscal year 2009  research and development expenses decreased, primarily reflecting decreased third-party development and programming costs and the capitalization of certain microsoft office system software development costs. these decreases were offset in part by the capitalization of certain software and development costs related to windows 7 product development in the prior year.  sales and marketing  \u00a0  sales and marketing expenses include payroll, employee benefits, stock-based compensation expense, and other headcount-related expenses associated with sales and marketing personnel and the costs of advertising, promotions, trade shows, seminars, and other programs.  fiscal year 2011 compared with fiscal year 2010  sales and marketing expenses increased primarily as a result of increased advertising and marketing of the xbox 360 platform, windows phone, and windows and windows live, a 5% increase in headcount-related expenses, and increased fees paid to third party enterprise software advisors.  fiscal year 2010 compared with fiscal year 2009  sales and marketing expenses increased, primarily reflecting increased advertising and marketing of windows 7 and bing and increased sales force expenses related to windows 7.  general and administrative  \u00a0  general and administrative expenses include payroll, employee benefits, stock-based compensation expense, severance expense, and other headcount-related expenses associated with finance, legal, facilities, certain human resources and other administrative personnel, certain taxes, and legal and other administrative fees.  fiscal year 2011 compared with fiscal year 2010  general and administrative expenses increased primarily due to a 12% increase in headcount-related expenses and new puerto rican excise taxes, partially offset by prior year transition expenses associated with the inception of the yahoo! commercial agreement.  fiscal year 2010 compared with fiscal year 2009  general and administrative expenses increased due to increased legal charges, as discussed above within corporate-level activity, and transition expenses associated with the inception of the yahoo! commercial agreement. these increases were offset in part by a 6% reduction in headcount-related expenses and lower severance costs. during fiscal years 2010 and 2009, general and administrative expenses included employee severance expense of $59 million and $330 million, respectively, associated with a resource management program that was announced in january 2009 and completed in fiscal year 2010.  \u00a0 32  table of contents  \u00a0  part ii  item 7  \u00a0 \u00a0 other income (expense) and income taxes  other income (expense)  the components of other income (expense) were as follows:  \u00a0 we use derivative instruments to manage risks related to foreign currencies, equity prices, interest rates, and credit; to enhance investment returns; and to facilitate portfolio diversification. gains and losses from changes in fair values of derivatives that are not designated as hedges are recognized in other income (expense). these are generally offset by unrealized gains and losses in the underlying securities in the investment portfolio and are recorded as a component of other comprehensive income.  fiscal year 2011 compared with fiscal year 2010  dividends and interest income increased due to higher average portfolio investment balances, offset in part by lower yields on our fixed-income investments. interest expense increased due to our increased issuance of debt. net recognized gains on investments increased due primarily to higher gains on sales of equity securities, offset in part by fewer gains on sales of fixed-income securities. derivative losses decreased due primarily to higher gains on commodity derivatives offset in part by higher losses on currency contracts used to hedge foreign currency revenue.  fiscal year 2010 compared with fiscal year 2009  dividends and interest income increased primarily due to higher average portfolio investment balances, offset in part by lower yields on our fixed-income investments. interest expense increased due to our issuance of long term debt in may 2009. net recognized gains on investments increased primarily due to lower other-than-temporary impairments, offset in part by lower gains on sales of investments in the current period. other-than-temporary impairments were $69 million during fiscal year 2010, as compared with $862 million during fiscal year 2009 and decreased primarily due to improvements in market conditions. net losses on derivatives decreased due to gains on equity and interest rate derivatives as compared to losses in the prior period and lower losses on commodity and foreign currency contracts in the current period. net gains from foreign currency remeasurements were insignificant in fiscal year 2010 compared to net losses of $509 million in the prior year, which had resulted from the strengthening of the u.s. dollar in the prior year. for fiscal year 2010, other includes a gain on the divestiture of razorfish.  income taxes  fiscal year 2011 compared with fiscal year 2010  our effective tax rates for fiscal years 2011 and 2010 were approximately 18% and 25%, respectively. our effective tax rate was lower than the u.s. federal statutory rate and our prior year effective rate primarily due to a higher mix of earnings taxed at lower rates in foreign jurisdictions resulting from producing and distributing our products and services through our foreign regional operations centers in ireland, singapore, and puerto rico, which are subject to  \u00a0 33  table of contents  \u00a0  part ii  item 7  \u00a0 \u00a0  lower income tax rates. in fiscal years 2011 and 2010, our u.s. income before income taxes was $8.9 billion\u00a0and $9.6 billion, respectively, and comprised 32% and 38%, respectively, of our income before income taxes.\u00a0in fiscal years 2011 and 2010, the foreign income before income taxes was $19.2 billion and $15.4 billion, respectively, and comprised 68% and 62%, respectively, of our income before income taxes. in fiscal years 2011 and 2010, the reduction of the u.s. federal statutory rate as a result of foreign earnings taxed at lower rates was 16% and 12%, respectively.  in addition, our effective tax rate was lower than in the prior year due to a partial settlement with the i.r.s. in the third quarter of fiscal year 2011 relating to the audit of tax years 2004 to 2006. this partial settlement reduced our income tax expense for fiscal year 2011 by $461 million.  tax contingencies and other tax liabilities were $7.4 billion and $6.9 billion as of june\u00a030, 2011 and 2010, respectively, and are included in other long-term liabilities. we have not provided deferred u.s. income taxes or foreign withholding taxes on temporary differences of approximately $44.8 billion resulting from earnings for certain non-u.s. subsidiaries because they are permanently reinvested outside the u.s. the unrecognized deferred tax liability associated with these temporary differences was approximately $14.2 billion as of june\u00a030, 2011.  while we settled a portion of the i.r.s. audit for tax years 2004 to 2006 during the third quarter of fiscal year 2011, we remain under audit for these years. during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2011, the i.r.s. completed its examination and issued a revenue agent\u0092s report (\u0093rar\u0094) for the remaining unresolved items. we do not agree with the adjustments in the rar, and we have filed a protest to initiate the administrative appeals process. the proposed adjustments are primarily related to transfer pricing and could have a significant impact on our financial statements if not resolved favorably; however, we believe our existing reserves are adequate. we do not believe it is reasonably possible that the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits will significantly increase or decrease within the next 12 months, as we do not believe the appeals process will be concluded within the next 12 months. we also continue to be subject to examination by the i.r.s. for tax years 2007 to 2010.  fiscal year 2010 compared with fiscal year 2009  our effective tax rates in fiscal years 2010 and 2009 were approximately 25% and 27%, respectively. in fiscal years 2010 and 2009, the reduction to the u.s. federal statutory rate as a result of foreign earnings taxed at lower rates was 12% and 9%, respectively, reflecting the mix of u.s. and international income before income taxes and the impact of changes in unrecognized tax benefits related to international income. in fiscal years 2010 and 2009, foreign income before income taxes was $15.4 billion and $14.3 billion, respectively.  financial condition  cash, cash equivalents, and investments  cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments totaled $52.8 billion as of june\u00a030, 2011, compared with $36.8 billion as of june\u00a030, 2010. equity and other investments were $10.9 billion as of june\u00a030, 2011, compared with $7.8 billion as of june\u00a030, 2010. our short-term investments are primarily to facilitate liquidity and for capital preservation. they consist predominantly of highly liquid investment-grade fixed-income securities, diversified among industries and individual issuers. the investments are predominantly u.s. dollar-denominated securities, but also include foreign currency-denominated securities in order to diversify risk. our fixed-income investments are exposed to interest rate risk and credit risk. the credit risk and average maturity of our fixed-income portfolio are managed to achieve economic returns that correlate to certain fixed-income indices. the settlement risk related to these investments is insignificant given that the short-term investments held are primarily highly liquid investment-grade fixed-income securities. while we own certain mortgage-backed and asset-backed fixed-income securities, our portfolio as of june\u00a030, 2011 does not contain direct exposure to subprime mortgages or structured vehicles that derive their value from subprime collateral. the majority of our mortgage-backed securities are collateralized by prime residential mortgages and carry a 100% principal and interest guarantee, primarily from federal national mortgage association, federal home loan mortgage corporation, and government national mortgage association.  \u00a0 34  table of contents  \u00a0  part ii  item 7  \u00a0 \u00a0 of the cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments at june\u00a030, 2011, approximately $45 billion was held by our foreign subsidiaries and were subject to material repatriation tax effects. the amount of cash and investments held by foreign subsidiaries subject to other restrictions on the free flow of funds (primarily currency and other local regulatory) was approximately $379 million. as of june\u00a030, 2011, approximately 68% of the short-term investments held by our foreign subsidiaries were invested in u.s. government and agency securities, approximately 12% were invested in corporate notes and bonds of u.s. companies, and 5% were invested in u.s. mortgage-backed securities, all of which are denominated in u.s. dollars.  securities lending  we lend certain fixed-income and equity securities to increase investment returns. the loaned securities continue to be carried as investments on our balance sheet. cash and/or security interests are received as collateral for the loaned securities with the amount determined based upon the underlying security lent and the creditworthiness of the borrower. cash received is recorded as an asset with a corresponding liability. our securities lending payable balance was $1.2 billion as of june\u00a030, 2011. our average and maximum securities lending payable balances for the fiscal year were $1.6 billion and $3.3 billion, respectively. intra-year variances in the amount of securities loaned are mainly due to fluctuations in the demand for the securities.  valuation  in general, and where applicable, we use quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities to determine the fair value of our financial instruments.\u00a0this pricing methodology applies to our level 1 investments, such as exchange-traded mutual funds, domestic and international equities, and u.s. treasuries.\u00a0if quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities are not available to determine fair value, then we use quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities or inputs other than the quoted prices that are observable either directly or indirectly. this pricing methodology applies to our level 2 investments such as corporate notes and bonds, foreign government bonds, mortgage-backed securities, and agency securities.\u00a0level 3 investments are valued using internally developed models with unobservable inputs.\u00a0assets and liabilities measured using unobservable inputs are an immaterial portion of our portfolio.  a majority of our investments are priced by pricing vendors and are generally level 1 or level 2 investments as these vendors either provide a quoted market price in an active market or use observable inputs for their pricing without applying significant adjustments.\u00a0broker pricing is used mainly when a quoted price is not available, the investment is not priced by our pricing vendors, or when a broker price is more reflective of fair values in the market in which the investment trades. our broker-priced investments are generally labeled as level 2 investments because the broker prices these investments based on similar assets without applying significant adjustments.\u00a0in addition, all of our broker-priced investments have a sufficient level of trading volume to demonstrate that the fair values used are appropriate for these investments. our fair value processes include controls that are designed to ensure appropriate fair values are recorded.\u00a0these controls include model validation, review of key model inputs, analysis of period-over-period fluctuations, and independent recalculation of prices where appropriate.  cash flows  fiscal year 2011 compared with fiscal year 2010  cash flows from operations increased $2.9 billion during the current fiscal year to $27.0 billion due mainly to increased revenue and cash collections from customers. cash used in financing decreased $4.9 billion to $8.4 billion due mainly to a $5.8 billion increase in proceeds from issuance of debt, net of repayments, offset in part by a $602 million increase in cash paid for dividends. cash used in investing increased $3.3 billion to $14.6 billion due to a $5.8 billion increase in purchases of investments, offset in part by a $2.5 billion increase in cash from securities lending.  fiscal year 2010 compared with fiscal year 2009  cash flow from operations increased $5.0 billion, primarily due to payment of $4.1 billion to the internal revenue service in the prior year as a result of our settlement of the 2000-2003 audit examination along with increased cash received from customers in the current year. cash used for financing increased $5.8 billion, primarily due to a $5.6  \u00a0 35  table of contents  \u00a0  part ii  item 7  \u00a0 \u00a0  billion decrease in net cash proceeds from issuance and repayments of short-term and long-term debt. financing activities also included a $1.9 billion increase in cash used for common stock repurchases, which was offset in part by a $1.7 billion increase in cash received from common stock issued. cash used for investing decreased $4.5 billion due to a $3.3 billion decrease in cash used for combined investment purchases, sales, and maturities along with a $1.1 billion decrease in additions to property and equipment.  debt  short-term debt  during fiscal year 2011, we repaid $1.0 billion of commercial paper, leaving zero outstanding.  on november\u00a05, 2010, our $1.0 billion 364-day credit facility expired. this facility served as a back-up for our commercial paper program. no amounts were drawn against the credit facility during any of the periods presented.  long-term debt  we issued debt during the periods presented to take advantage of favorable pricing and liquidity in the debt markets, reflecting our superior credit rating and the low interest rate environment. the proceeds of these issuances were used to partially fund discretionary business acquisitions and share repurchases.  as of june\u00a030, 2011, the total carrying value and estimated fair value of our long-term debt, including convertible debt, were $11.9 billion and $12.1 billion, respectively. this is compared to a carrying value and estimated fair value of $4.9 billion and $5.2 billion, respectively, as of june 30, 2010. the estimated fair value is based on quoted prices for our publicly-traded debt as of june\u00a030, 2011 and 2010, as applicable.  the components of long-term debt, the associated interest rates, and the semi-annual interest record and payment dates were as follows as of june\u00a030, 2011:  \u00a0 notes  the notes are senior unsecured obligations and rank equally with our other unsecured and unsubordinated debt outstanding.  \u00a0 36  table of contents  \u00a0  part ii  item 7  \u00a0 \u00a0 convertible debt  in june 2010, we issued $1.25 billion of zero coupon convertible unsecured debt due on june\u00a015, 2013 in a private placement offering. proceeds from the offering were $1.24 billion, net of fees and expenses, which were capitalized. each $1,000 principal amount of notes is convertible into 29.94 shares of microsoft common stock at a conversion price of $33.40 per share. as of june\u00a030, 2011, the net carrying amount of our convertible debt was $1.2 billion and the unamortized discount was $38 million.  prior to march\u00a015, 2013, the notes will be convertible, only in certain circumstances, into cash and, if applicable, cash, shares of microsoft\u0092s common stock, or a combination thereof, at our election. on or after march\u00a015, 2013, the notes will be convertible at any time. upon conversion, we will pay cash up to the aggregate principal amount of the notes and pay or deliver cash, shares of our common stock, or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock, at our election.  because the convertible debt may be wholly or partially settled in cash, we are required to separately account for the liability and equity components of the notes in a manner that reflects our nonconvertible debt borrowing rate when interest costs are recognized in subsequent periods. the net proceeds of $1.24 billion were allocated between debt for $1.18 billion and stockholders\u0092 equity for $58 million with the portion in stockholders\u0092 equity representing the fair value of the option to convert the debt.  in connection with the issuance of the notes, we entered into capped call transactions with certain option counterparties who are initial purchasers of the notes or their affiliates. the capped call transactions are expected to reduce potential dilution of earnings per share upon conversion of the notes. under the capped call transactions, we purchased from the option counterparties capped call options that in the aggregate relate to the total number of shares of our common stock underlying the notes, with a strike price equal to the conversion price of the notes and with a cap price equal to $37.16. the purchased capped calls were valued at $40 million and recorded to stockholders\u0092 equity.  unearned revenue  unearned revenue at june\u00a030, 2011 comprised mainly unearned revenue from volume licensing programs. unearned revenue from volume licensing programs represents customer billings for multi-year licensing arrangements paid for either at inception of the agreement or annually at the beginning of each billing coverage period and accounted for as subscriptions with revenue recognized ratably over the billing coverage period. unearned revenue at june\u00a030, 2011 also included payments for: post-delivery support and consulting services to be performed in the future; xbox live subscriptions and prepaid points; microsoft dynamics business solutions products; oem minimum commitments; unspecified upgrades/enhancements of windows phone and microsoft internet explorer on a when-and-if-available basis for windows xp; and other offerings for which we have been paid in advance and earn the revenue when we provide the service or software, or otherwise meet the revenue recognition criteria.  the following table outlines the expected future recognition of unearned revenue as of june\u00a030, 2011:  \u00a0 \u00a0 37  table of contents  \u00a0  part ii  item 7  \u00a0 \u00a0 share repurchases  on september\u00a022, 2008, we announced the completion of the two repurchase programs approved by our board of directors during the first quarter of fiscal year 2007 (the \u00932007 programs\u0094) to buy back up to $40.0 billion of microsoft common stock. on september\u00a022, 2008, we also announced that our board of directors approved a new share repurchase program authorizing up to $40.0 billion in share repurchases with an expiration date of september\u00a030, 2013 (the \u00932008 program\u0094). as of june\u00a030, 2011, approximately $12.2 billion remained of the $40.0 billion approved repurchase amount. the repurchase program may be suspended or discontinued at any time without notice.  during the periods reported, we repurchased with cash resources: 447\u00a0million shares for $11.5 billion during fiscal year 2011; 380\u00a0million shares for $10.8 billion during fiscal year 2010; and 318\u00a0million shares for $8.2 billion during fiscal year 2009. all shares repurchased in fiscal years 2011 and 2010 were repurchased under the 2008 program. of the shares repurchased in fiscal year 2009, 101\u00a0million shares were repurchased for $2.7 billion under the 2007 programs, while the remainder was repurchased under the 2008 program.  dividends  during fiscal years 2011 and 2010, our board of directors declared the following dividends:  \u00a0  off-balance sheet arrangements  we provide indemnifications of varying scope and size to certain customers against claims of intellectual property infringement made by third parties arising from the use of our products and certain other matters. in evaluating estimated losses on these indemnifications, we consider factors such as the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and our ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss. to date, we have not encountered significant costs as a result of these obligations and have not accrued in our financial statements any liabilities related to these indemnifications.  \u00a0 38  table of contents  \u00a0  part ii  item 7  \u00a0 \u00a0 contractual obligations  the following table summarizes the payments due by fiscal year for our outstanding contractual obligations as of june\u00a030, 2011.  \u00a0 \u00a0 other planned uses of capital  we will continue to invest in sales, marketing, product support infrastructure, and existing and advanced areas of technology. additions to property and equipment will continue, including new facilities, data centers, and computer systems for research and development, sales and marketing, support, and administrative staff. we have operating leases for most u.s. and international sales and support offices and certain equipment. we have not engaged in any related party transactions or arrangements with unconsolidated entities or other persons that are reasonably likely to materially affect liquidity or the availability of capital resources.  definitive agreement with skype  on may\u00a010, 2011, we announced that we had entered into a definitive agreement with skype global s.\u00e0.r.l. (\u0093skype\u0094) under which we would acquire skype, a leading internet communications company, for $8.5 billion in cash. we anticipate the acquisition will extend skype\u0092s brand and reach of its network platform, while enhancing our existing portfolio of real-time communications products and services. the acquisition is subject to regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions. we obtained regulatory approval in the u.s. and expect to obtain all remaining required regulatory approvals during calendar year 2011.  liquidity  we earn a significant amount of our operating income outside the u.s., which is deemed to be permanently reinvested in foreign jurisdictions. as a result, as discussed above under cash, cash equivalents, and investments, the majority of our cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments are held by foreign subsidiaries. we currently do not intend nor foresee a need to repatriate these funds. we expect existing domestic cash, cash equivalents,  \u00a0 39  table of contents  \u00a0  part ii  item 7  \u00a0 \u00a0  short-term investments, and cash flows from operations to continue to be sufficient to fund our domestic operating activities and cash commitments for investing and financing activities, such as regular quarterly dividends, debt repayment schedules, and material capital expenditures, for at least the next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future. in addition, we expect existing foreign cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, and cash flows from operations to continue to be sufficient to fund our foreign operating activities and cash commitments for investing activities, such as material capital expenditures, for at least the next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future.  should we require more capital in the u.s. than is generated by our operations domestically, for example to fund significant discretionary activities, such as acquisitions of businesses and share repurchases, we could elect to repatriate future earnings from foreign jurisdictions or raise capital in the u.s. through debt or equity issuances. these alternatives could result in higher effective tax rates, increased interest expense, or other dilution of our earnings. we have borrowed funds domestically and continue to have the ability to borrow funds domestically at reasonable interest rates.  as a result of the special dividend paid in the second quarter of fiscal year 2005 and shares repurchased, our retained deficit, including accumulated other comprehensive income, was $6.3 billion at june\u00a030, 2011. our retained deficit is not expected to affect our future ability to operate, pay dividends, or repay our debt given our continuing profitability and strong financial position.  recently issued accounting standards  recently adopted accounting pronouncements  on july\u00a01, 2010, we adopted guidance issued by the financial accounting standards board (\u0093fasb\u0094) on revenue recognition. under the new guidance on arrangements that include software elements, tangible products that have software components that are essential to the functionality of the tangible product are no longer within the scope of the software revenue recognition guidance, and software-enabled products are now subject to other relevant revenue recognition guidance. additionally, the fasb issued guidance on revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables that are outside the scope of the software revenue recognition guidance. under the new guidance, when vendor specific objective evidence or third party evidence for deliverables in an arrangement cannot be determined, a best estimate of the selling price is required to separate deliverables and allocate arrangement consideration using the relative selling price method. the new guidance includes new disclosure requirements on how the application of the relative selling price method affects the timing and amount of revenue recognition. adoption of the new guidance did not have a material impact on our financial statements.  on july\u00a01, 2010, we adopted new guidance issued by the fasb on the consolidation of variable interest entities. the new guidance requires revised evaluations of whether entities represent variable interest entities, ongoing assessments of control over such entities, and additional disclosures for variable interests. adoption of the new guidance did not have a material impact on our financial statements.  recent accounting pronouncements not yet adopted  in june 2011, the fasb issued guidance on presentation of comprehensive income.\u00a0the new guidance eliminates the current option to report other comprehensive income and its components in the statement of changes in equity.\u00a0instead, an entity will be required to present either a continuous statement of net income and other comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements.\u00a0the new guidance will be effective for us beginning july\u00a01, 2012 and will have presentation changes only. in may 2011, the fasb issued guidance to amend the accounting and disclosure requirements on fair value measurements.\u00a0the new guidance limits the highest-and-best-use measure to nonfinancial assets, permits certain financial assets and liabilities with offsetting positions in market or counterparty credit risks to be measured at a net basis, and provides guidance on the applicability of premiums and discounts.\u00a0additionally, the new guidance  \u00a0 40  table of contents  \u00a0  part ii  item 7  \u00a0 \u00a0  expands the disclosures on level 3 inputs by requiring quantitative disclosure of the unobservable inputs and assumptions, as well as description of the valuation processes and the sensitivity of the fair value to changes in unobservable inputs. the new guidance will be effective for us beginning january\u00a01, 2012.\u00a0other than requiring additional disclosures, we do not anticipate material impacts on our financial statements upon adoption. in january 2010, the fasb issued guidance to amend the disclosure requirements related to fair value measurements. the guidance requires the disclosure of roll forward activities on purchases, sales, issuance, and settlements of the assets and liabilities measured using significant unobservable inputs (level 3 fair value measurements). the guidance will become effective for us with the reporting period beginning july\u00a01, 2011. other than requiring additional disclosures, the adoption of this new guidance will not have a material impact on our financial statements.  application of critical accounting policies  our financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states (\u0093u.s. gaap\u0094). preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. these estimates and assumptions are affected by management\u0092s application of accounting policies. critical accounting policies for us include revenue recognition, impairment of investment securities, goodwill, research and development costs, contingencies, income taxes, and stock-based compensation.  revenue recognition  software revenue recognition requires judgment, including whether a software arrangement includes multiple elements, and if so, whether vendor-specific objective evidence (\u0093vsoe\u0094) of fair value exists for those elements. a portion of revenue may be recorded as unearned due to undelivered elements. changes to the elements in a software arrangement, the ability to identify vsoe for those elements, and the fair value of the respective elements could materially impact the amount of earned and unearned revenue. judgment is also required to assess whether future releases of certain software represent new products or upgrades and enhancements to existing products.  impairment of investment securities  investments are reviewed quarterly for indicators of other-than-temporary impairment. this determination requires significant judgment. in making this judgment, we employ a systematic methodology quarterly that considers available quantitative and qualitative evidence in evaluating potential impairment of our investments. if the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value, we evaluate, among other factors, general market conditions, credit quality of debt instrument issuers, the duration and extent to which the fair value is less than cost, and for equity securities, our intent and ability to hold, or plans to sell, the investment. for fixed-income securities, we also evaluate whether we have plans to sell the security or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery. we also consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of and business outlook for the investee, including industry and sector performance, changes in technology, and operational and financing cash flow factors. once a decline in fair value is determined to be other-than-temporary, an impairment charge is recorded to other income (expense) and a new cost basis in the investment is established. if market, industry, and/or investee conditions deteriorate, we may incur future impairments.  goodwill  we allocate goodwill to reporting units based on the reporting unit expected to benefit from the business combination. we evaluate our reporting units on an annual basis and, if necessary, reassign goodwill using a relative fair value allocation approach. goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level (operating segment or one level below an operating segment) on an annual basis (may 1 for us) and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. these events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate, legal factors, operating performance indicators, competition, or sale or disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit.  \u00a0 41  table of contents  \u00a0  part ii  item 7  \u00a0 \u00a0 application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment, including the identification of reporting units, assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units, assignment of goodwill to reporting units, and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit. the fair value of each reporting unit is estimated using a discounted cash flow methodology. this analysis requires significant judgments, including estimation of future cash flows, which is dependent on internal forecasts, estimation of the long-term rate of growth for our business, estimation of the useful life over which cash flows will occur, and determination of our weighted average cost of capital. among our reporting units, the fair value of osd has been the closest to its carrying value. the carrying value of osd\u0092s goodwill was $6.4 billion as of june\u00a030, 2011.  the estimates used to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit change from year to year based on operating results and market conditions. changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and goodwill impairment for each reporting unit.  research and development costs  costs incurred internally in researching and developing a computer software product are charged to expense until technological feasibility has been established for the product. once technological feasibility is established, all software costs are capitalized until the product is available for general release to customers. judgment is required in determining when technological feasibility of a product is established. we have determined that technological feasibility for our software products is reached after all high-risk development issues have been resolved through coding and testing. generally, this occurs shortly before the products are released to manufacturing. the amortization of these costs is included in cost of revenue over the estimated life of the products.  legal and other contingencies  the outcomes of legal proceedings and claims brought against us are subject to significant uncertainty. an estimated loss from a loss contingency such as a legal proceeding or claim is accrued by a charge to income if it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. disclosure of a contingency is required if there is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss has been incurred. in determining whether a loss should be accrued we evaluate, among other factors, the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss. changes in these factors could materially impact our financial statements.  income taxes  the objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entity\u0092s financial statements or tax returns. we recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position should be measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. accounting literature also provides guidance on derecognition of income tax assets and liabilities, classification of current and deferred income tax assets and liabilities, accounting for interest and penalties associated with tax positions, and income tax disclosures. judgment is required in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns. variations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could materially impact our financial statements.  stock-based compensation  stock-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period. determining the fair value of stock-based awards at the grant date requires judgment, including estimating expected dividends. in addition, judgment is also required in estimating the amount of stock-based awards that are expected to be forfeited. if actual results differ significantly from these estimates, stock-based compensation expense and our results of operations could be impacted.  \u00a0 42  table of contents  \u00a0  part ii  item 7  \u00a0 \u00a0 statement of management\u0092s responsibility for financial statements  management is responsible for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements and related information that are presented in this report. the consolidated financial statements, which include amounts based on management\u0092s estimates and judgments, have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america.  the company designs and maintains accounting and internal control systems to provide reasonable assurance at reasonable cost that assets are safeguarded against loss from unauthorized use or disposition, and that the financial records are reliable for preparing financial statements and maintaining accountability for assets. these systems are augmented by written policies, an organizational structure providing division of responsibilities, careful selection and training of qualified personnel, and a program of internal audits.  the company engaged deloitte\u00a0& touche llp, an independent registered public accounting firm, to audit and render an opinion on the consolidated financial statements and internal control over financial reporting in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board (united states).  the board of directors, through its audit committee, consisting solely of independent directors of the company, meets periodically with management, internal auditors, and our independent registered public accounting firm to ensure that each is meeting its responsibilities and to discuss matters concerning internal controls and financial reporting. deloitte\u00a0& touche llp and the internal auditors each have full and free access to the audit committee.  \u00a0 \u00a0 43  table of contents  \u00a0  part ii  item 7a  \u00a0 \u00a0 item\u00a07a.\u00a0quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk  risks  we are exposed to economic risk from foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, credit risk, equity prices, and commodity prices. a portion of these risks is hedged, but they may impact our financial statements.  foreign currency  certain forecasted transactions, assets, and liabilities are exposed to foreign currency risk. we monitor our foreign currency exposures daily and use hedges where practicable to offset the risks and maximize the economic effectiveness of our foreign currency positions. principal currencies hedged include the euro, japanese yen, british pound, and canadian dollar.  interest rate  our fixed-income portfolio is diversified across credit sectors and maturities, consisting primarily of investment-grade securities. the credit risk and average maturity of the fixed-income portfolio is managed to achieve economic returns that correlate to certain global and domestic fixed-income indices. in addition, we use \u0093to be announced\u0094 forward purchase commitments of mortgage-backed assets to gain exposure to agency and mortgage-backed securities.  equity  our equity portfolio consists of global, developed, and emerging market securities that are subject to market price risk.\u00a0we manage the securities relative to certain global and domestic indices and expect their economic risk and return to correlate with these indices.  commodity  we use broad-based commodity exposures to enhance portfolio returns and facilitate portfolio diversification. our investment portfolio has exposure to a variety of commodities, including precious metals, energy, and grain. we manage these exposures relative to global commodity indices and expect their economic risk and return to correlate with these indices.  value-at-risk  we use a value-at-risk (\u0093var\u0094) model to estimate and quantify our market risks. var is the expected loss, for a given confidence level, in the fair value of our portfolio due to adverse market movements over a defined time horizon. the var model is not intended to represent actual losses in fair value, including determinations of other-than-temporary losses in fair value in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states (\u0093u.s. gaap\u0094), but is used as a risk estimation and management tool. the distribution of the potential changes in total market value of all holdings is computed based on the historical volatilities and correlations among foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, equity prices, and commodity prices, assuming normal market conditions.  the var is calculated as the total loss that will not be exceeded at the 97.5 percentile confidence level or, alternatively stated, the losses could exceed the var in 25 out of 1,000 cases. several risk factors are not captured in the model, including liquidity risk, operational risk, and legal risk.  \u00a0 44  table of contents  \u00a0  part ii  item 7a  \u00a0 \u00a0 the following table sets forth the one-day var for substantially all of our positions as of june\u00a030, 2011 and 2010 and for the year ended june\u00a030, 2011:  \u00a0  total one-day var for the combined risk categories was $290 million at june\u00a030, 2011 and $235 million at june\u00a030, 2010. the total var is 25% less at june\u00a030, 2011, and 26% less at june\u00a030, 2010, than the sum of the separate risk categories in the above table due to the diversification benefit of the combination of risks.  \u00a0 45  table of contents  \u00a0  part ii  item 8  \u00a0 \u00a0 stockholders\u0092 equity statements  \u00a0 see accompanying notes.  \u00a0 49  table of contents  \u00a0  part ii  item 8  \u00a0 \u00a0 notes to financial statements  note 1 - accounting policies  accounting principles  the financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america (\u0093u.s. gaap\u0094).  principles of consolidation  the financial statements include the accounts of microsoft corporation and its subsidiaries. intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated. equity investments through which we exercise significant influence over but do not control the investee and are not the primary beneficiary of the investee\u0092s activities are accounted for using the equity method. investments through which we are not able to exercise significant influence over the investee and which do not have readily determinable fair values are accounted for under the cost method.  estimates and assumptions  preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. examples include: estimates of loss contingencies, product warranties, product life cycles, product returns, and stock-based compensation forfeiture rates; assumptions such as the elements comprising a software arrangement, including the distinction between upgrades/enhancements and new products; when technological feasibility is achieved for our products; the potential outcome of future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns; estimating the fair value and/or goodwill impairment for our reporting units; and determining when investment impairments are other-than-temporary. actual results and outcomes may differ from management\u0092s estimates and assumptions.  foreign currencies  assets and liabilities recorded in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rate on the balance sheet date. revenue and expenses are translated at average rates of exchange prevailing during the year. translation adjustments resulting from this process are recorded to other comprehensive income (\u0093oci\u0094).  revenue recognition  revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the fee is fixed or determinable, and collectibility is probable. revenue generally is recognized net of any taxes collected from customers and subsequently remitted to governmental authorities.  revenue for retail packaged products, products licensed to original equipment manufacturers (\u0093oems\u0094), and perpetual licenses under certain volume licensing programs generally is recognized as products are shipped or made available. revenue for products under technology guarantee programs, which provide free or significantly discounted rights to use upcoming new versions of a software product if an end user licenses existing versions of the product during the eligibility period, is allocated between existing product and the new product, and revenue allocated to the new product is deferred until that version is delivered. the revenue allocation is based on vendor-specific objective evidence of fair value of the products.  certain multi-year licensing arrangements include a perpetual license for current products combined with rights to receive future versions of software products on a when-and-if-available basis (\u0093software assurance\u0094) and are accounted for as subscriptions, with billings recorded as unearned revenue and recognized as revenue ratably over the billing coverage period. revenue from certain arrangements that allow for the use of a product or service over a  \u00a0 50  table of contents  \u00a0  part ii  item 8  \u00a0 \u00a0  period of time without taking possession of software are also accounted for as subscriptions. revenue for software products where customers have the right to receive unspecified upgrades/enhancements on a when-and-if-available basis and for which vendor-specific objective evidence of fair value does not exist for the upgrades/enhancements is recognized on a straight-line basis over the estimated life of the software.  revenue related to our xbox 360 gaming and entertainment console, kinect for xbox 360, games published by us, and other hardware components is generally recognized when ownership is transferred to the resellers. revenue related to games published by third parties for use on the xbox 360 platform is recognized when games are manufactured by the game publishers.  display advertising revenue is recognized as advertisements are displayed. search advertising revenue is recognized when the ad appears in the search results or when the action necessary to earn the revenue has been completed. consulting services revenue is recognized as services are rendered, generally based on the negotiated hourly rate in the consulting arrangement and the number of hours worked during the period. consulting revenue for fixed-price services arrangements is recognized as services are provided. revenue from prepaid points redeemable for the purchase of software or services is recognized upon redemption of the points and delivery of the software or services.  cost of revenue  cost of revenue includes; manufacturing and distribution costs for products sold and programs licensed; operating costs related to product support service centers and product distribution centers; costs incurred to include software on pcs sold by oems, to drive traffic to our web sites, and to acquire online advertising space (\u0093traffic acquisition costs\u0094); costs incurred to support and maintain internet-based products and services, including royalties; warranty costs; inventory valuation adjustments; costs associated with the delivery of consulting services; and the amortization of capitalized research and development costs. capitalized research and development costs are amortized over the estimated lives of the products.  product warranty  we provide for the estimated costs of fulfilling our obligations under hardware and software warranties at the time the related revenue is recognized. for hardware warranties, we estimate the costs based on historical and projected product failure rates, historical and projected repair costs, and knowledge of specific product failures (if any). the specific hardware warranty terms and conditions vary depending upon the product sold and the country in which we do business, but generally include parts and labor over a period generally ranging from 90\u00a0days to three years. for software warranties, we estimate the costs to provide bug fixes, such as security patches, over the estimated life of the software. we regularly reevaluate our estimates to assess the adequacy of the recorded warranty liabilities and adjust the amounts as necessary.  research and development  research and development expenses include payroll, employee benefits, stock-based compensation expense, and other headcount-related expenses associated with product development. research and development expenses also include third-party development and programming costs, localization costs incurred to translate software for international markets, and the amortization of purchased software code and services content. such costs related to software development are included in research and development expense until the point that technological feasibility is reached, which for our software products, is generally shortly before the products are released to manufacturing. once technological feasibility is reached, such costs are capitalized and amortized to cost of revenue over the estimated lives of the products.  sales and marketing  sales and marketing expenses include payroll, employee benefits, stock-based compensation expense, and other headcount-related expenses associated with sales and marketing personnel, and the costs of advertising, promotions, trade shows, seminars, and other programs. advertising costs are expensed as incurred. advertising expense was $1.9 billion, $1.6 billion, and $1.4 billion in fiscal years 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively.  \u00a0 51  table of contents  \u00a0  part ii  item 8  \u00a0 \u00a0 employee severance  we record employee severance when a specific plan has been approved by management, the plan has been communicated to employees, and it is unlikely that significant changes will be made to the plan. in january 2009, we announced and implemented a resource management program to reduce discretionary operating expenses, employee headcount, and capital expenditures. severance expenses associated with this program were $59 million and $330 million in fiscal years 2010 and 2009, respectively, and are included in general and administrative expenses.  stock-based compensation  we measure stock-based compensation cost at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and recognize it as expense over the vesting or service period, as applicable, of the stock award (generally four to five years) using the straight-line method.  employee stock purchase plan  shares of our common stock may be purchased by employees at three-month intervals at 90% of the fair market value of the stock on the last day of each three-month period. compensation expense for the employee stock purchase plan is measured as the discount the employee is entitled to upon purchase and is recognized in the period of purchase.  income taxes  income tax expense includes u.s. and international income taxes, the provision for u.s. taxes on undistributed earnings of international subsidiaries not deemed to be permanently invested, and interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions. certain income and expenses are not reported in tax returns and financial statements in the same year. the tax effect of such temporary differences is reported as deferred income taxes. the deferred income taxes are classified as current or long-term based on the classification of the related asset or liability.  fair value measurements  we account for certain assets and liabilities at fair value. the hierarchy below lists three levels of fair value based on the extent to which inputs used in measuring fair value are observable in the market.\u00a0we categorize each of our fair value measurements in one of these three levels based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. these levels are:  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 52  table of contents  \u00a0  part ii  item 8  \u00a0 \u00a0 we measure certain assets, including our cost and equity method investments, at fair value on a nonrecurring basis when they are deemed to be other-than-temporarily impaired. the fair values of these investments are determined based on valuation techniques using the best information available, and may include quoted market prices, market comparables, and discounted cash flow projections. an impairment charge is recorded when the cost of the investment exceeds its fair value and this condition is determined to be other-than-temporary.  our current financial liabilities have fair values that approximate their carrying values. our long-term financial liabilities consist of long-term debt which is recorded on the balance sheet at issuance price less unamortized discount.  financial instruments  we consider all highly liquid interest-earning investments with a maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase to be cash equivalents. the fair values of these investments approximate their carrying values. in general, investments with original maturities of greater than three months and remaining maturities of less than one year are classified as short-term investments. investments with maturities beyond one year may be classified as short-term based on their highly liquid nature and because such marketable securities represent the investment of cash that is available for current operations. all cash equivalents and short-term investments are classified as available-for-sale and realized gains and losses are recorded using the specific identification method. changes in market value, excluding other-than-temporary impairments, are reflected in oci.  equity and other investments classified as long-term include both debt and equity instruments. debt and publicly-traded equity securities are classified as available-for-sale and realized gains and losses are recorded using the specific identification method. changes in market value, excluding other-than-temporary impairments, are reflected in oci. common and preferred stock and other investments that are restricted for more than one year or are not publicly traded are recorded at cost or using the equity method.  we lend certain fixed-income and equity securities to increase investment returns. the loaned securities continue to be carried as investments on our balance sheet. cash and/or security interests are received as collateral for the loan securities with the amount determined based upon the underlying security lent and the creditworthiness of the borrower. cash received is recorded as an asset with a corresponding liability.  investments are considered to be impaired when a decline in fair value is judged to be other-than-temporary. fair value is calculated based on publicly available market information or other estimates determined by management. we employ a systematic methodology on a quarterly basis that considers available quantitative and qualitative evidence in evaluating potential impairment of our investments. if the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value, we evaluate, among other factors, general market conditions, credit quality of debt instrument issuers, the duration and extent to which the fair value is less than cost, and for equity securities, our intent and ability to hold, or plans to sell, the investment. for fixed-income securities, we also evaluate whether we have plans to sell the security or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery. we also consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of and business outlook for the investee, including industry and sector performance, changes in technology, and operational and financing cash flow factors. once a decline in fair value is determined to be other-than-temporary, an impairment charge is recorded to other income (expense) and a new cost basis in the investment is established.  \u00a0 53  table of contents  \u00a0  part ii  item 8  \u00a0 \u00a0 derivative instruments are recognized as either assets or liabilities and are measured at fair value. the accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation.  for a derivative instrument designated as a fair-value hedge, the gain (loss) is recognized in earnings in the period of change together with the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item attributed to the risk being hedged. for options designated as fair-value hedges, changes in the time value are excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and are recognized in earnings.  for derivative instruments designated as cash-flow hedges, the effective portion of the derivative\u0092s gain (loss) is initially reported as a component of oci and is subsequently recognized in earnings when the hedged exposure is recognized in earnings. for options designated as cash-flow hedges, changes in the time value are excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and are recognized in earnings. gains (losses) on derivatives representing either hedge components excluded from the assessment of effectiveness or hedge ineffectiveness are recognized in earnings.  for derivative instruments that are not designated as hedges, gains (losses) from changes in fair values are primarily recognized in other income (expense). other than those derivatives entered into for investment purposes, such as commodity contracts, the gains (losses) are generally economically offset by unrealized gains (losses) in the underlying available-for-sale securities, which are recorded as a component of oci until the securities are sold or other-than-temporarily impaired, at which time the amounts are moved from oci into other income (expense).  allowance for doubtful accounts  the allowance for doubtful accounts reflects our best estimate of probable losses inherent in the accounts receivable balance. we determine the allowance based on known troubled accounts, historical experience, and other currently available evidence. activity in the allowance for doubtful accounts was as follows:  \u00a0 inventories  inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market, using the average cost method. cost includes materials, labor, and manufacturing overhead related to the purchase and production of inventories. we regularly review inventory quantities on hand, future purchase commitments with our suppliers, and the estimated utility of our inventory. if our review indicates a reduction in utility below carrying value, we reduce our inventory to a new cost basis through a charge to cost of revenue.  property and equipment  property and equipment is stated at cost and depreciated using the straight-line method over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the asset or the lease term. the estimated useful lives of our property and equipment are generally as follows: computer software developed or acquired for internal use, three years; computer equipment, two to three years; buildings and improvements, five to 15 years; leasehold improvements, two to 10 years; and furniture and equipment, one to five years. land is not depreciated.  \u00a0 54  table of contents  \u00a0  part ii  item 8  \u00a0 \u00a0 goodwill  goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level (operating segment or one level below an operating segment) on an annual basis (may 1 for us) and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value.  intangible assets  all of our intangible assets are subject to amortization and are amortized using the straight-line method over their estimated period of benefit, ranging from one to 10 years. we evaluate the recoverability of intangible assets periodically by taking into account events or circumstances that may warrant revised estimates of useful lives or that indicate the asset may be impaired.  recently issued accounting standards  recently adopted accounting pronouncements  on july\u00a01, 2010, we adopted guidance issued by the financial accounting standards board (\u0093fasb\u0094) on revenue recognition. under the new guidance on arrangements that include software elements, tangible products that have software components that are essential to the functionality of the tangible product are no longer within the scope of the software revenue recognition guidance, and software-enabled products are now subject to other relevant revenue recognition guidance. additionally, the fasb issued guidance on revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables that are outside the scope of the software revenue recognition guidance. under the new guidance, when vendor specific objective evidence or third party evidence for deliverables in an arrangement cannot be determined, a best estimate of the selling price is required to separate deliverables and allocate arrangement consideration using the relative selling price method. the new guidance includes new disclosure requirements on how the application of the relative selling price method affects the timing and amount of revenue recognition. adoption of the new guidance did not have a material impact on our financial statements.  on july\u00a01, 2010, we adopted new guidance issued by the fasb on the consolidation of variable interest entities. the new guidance requires revised evaluations of whether entities represent variable interest entities, ongoing assessments of control over such entities, and additional disclosures for variable interests. adoption of the new guidance did not have a material impact on our financial statements.  recent accounting pronouncements not yet adopted  in june 2011, the fasb issued guidance on presentation of comprehensive income.\u00a0the new guidance eliminates the current option to report other comprehensive income and its components in the statement of changes in equity.\u00a0instead, an entity will be required to present either a continuous statement of net income and other comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements.\u00a0the new guidance will be effective for us beginning july\u00a01, 2012 and will have presentation changes only. in may 2011, the fasb issued guidance to amend the accounting and disclosure requirements on fair value measurements.\u00a0the new guidance limits the highest-and-best-use measure to nonfinancial assets, permits certain financial assets and liabilities with offsetting positions in market or counterparty credit risks to be measured at a net basis, and provides guidance on the applicability of premiums and discounts.\u00a0additionally, the new guidance expands the disclosures on level 3 inputs by requiring quantitative disclosure of the unobservable inputs and assumptions, as well as description of the valuation processes and the sensitivity of the fair value to changes in unobservable inputs. the new guidance will be effective for us beginning january\u00a01, 2012.\u00a0other than requiring additional disclosures, we do not anticipate material impacts on our financial statements upon adoption. \u00a0 55  table of contents  \u00a0  part ii  item 8  \u00a0 \u00a0 in january 2010, the fasb issued guidance to amend the disclosure requirements related to fair value measurements. the guidance requires the disclosure of roll forward activities on purchases, sales, issuance, and settlements of the assets and liabilities measured using significant unobservable inputs (level 3 fair value measurements). the guidance will become effective for us with the reporting period beginning july\u00a01, 2011. other than requiring additional disclosures, the adoption of this new guidance will not have a material impact on our financial statements.  note 2 - earnings per share  basic earnings per share (\u0093eps\u0094) is computed based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. diluted eps is computed based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock plus the effect of dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period using the treasury stock method. dilutive potential common shares include outstanding stock options, stock awards, and shared performance stock awards. the components of basic and diluted eps are as follows:  \u00a0  we excluded the following shares underlying stock-based awards from the calculations of diluted eps because their inclusion would have been anti-dilutive:  \u00a0  the decrease in anti-dilutive shares from fiscal year 2009 to 2010 was due mainly to the decrease in employee stock options outstanding.  in june 2010, we issued $1.25 billion of zero-coupon debt securities that are convertible into shares of our common stock if certain conditions are met.\u00a0as of june\u00a030, 2011, none of these securities had met price or other conditions that would make them eligible for issuance and therefore were excluded from the calculation of either the basic or diluted eps. see note\u00a012\u00a0\u0096 debt for additional information.  note 3 - other income (expense)  the components of other income (expense) were as follows:  \u00a0 \u00a0 56  table of contents  \u00a0  part ii  item 8  \u00a0 \u00a0 following are details of net recognized gains (losses) on investments during the periods reported: \u00a0 note 4 - investments  investment components  the components of investments, including associated derivatives, were as follows:  \u00a0 \u00a0 57  table of contents  \u00a0  part ii  item 8  \u00a0 \u00a0 unrealized losses on investments  investments with continuous unrealized losses for less than 12 months and 12 months or greater and their related fair values were as follows:  \u00a0 unrealized losses from fixed-income securities are primarily attributable to changes in interest rates. unrealized losses from domestic and international equities are due to market price movements. management does not believe any remaining unrealized losses represent other-than-temporary impairments based on our evaluation of available evidence as of june\u00a030, 2011.  at june\u00a030, 2011 and 2010, the recorded bases and estimated fair values of common and preferred stock and other investments that are restricted for more than one year or are not publicly traded were $334 million and $216 million, respectively.  debt investment maturities  \u00a0 \u00a0 58  table of contents  \u00a0  part ii  item 8  \u00a0 \u00a0 note 5 - derivatives  we use derivative instruments to manage risks related to foreign currencies, equity prices, interest rates, and credit; to enhance investment returns; and to facilitate portfolio diversification. our objectives for holding derivatives include reducing, eliminating, and efficiently managing the economic impact of these exposures as effectively as possible. our derivative programs include strategies that both qualify and do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment. all notional amounts presented below are measured in u.s. currency equivalents.  foreign currency  certain forecasted transactions, assets, and liabilities are exposed to foreign currency risk. we monitor our foreign currency exposures daily to maximize the economic effectiveness of our foreign currency hedge positions. option and forward contracts are used to hedge a portion of forecasted international revenue for up to three years in the future and are designated as cash-flow hedging instruments. principal currencies hedged include the euro, japanese yen, british pound, and canadian dollar. as of june\u00a030, 2011 and 2010, the total notional amounts of these foreign exchange contracts sold were $10.6 billion and $9.3 billion, respectively.\u00a0foreign currency risks related to certain non-u.s. dollar denominated securities are hedged using foreign exchange forward contracts that are designated as fair-value hedging instruments. as of june\u00a030, 2011 and 2010, the total notional amounts of these foreign exchange contracts sold were $572 million and $523 million, respectively.\u00a0certain options and forwards not designated as hedging instruments are also used to manage the variability in exchange rates on accounts receivable, cash, and intercompany positions, and to manage other foreign currency exposures.\u00a0as of june\u00a030, 2011, the total notional amounts of these foreign exchange contracts purchased and sold were $3.9 billion and $7.3 billion, respectively. as of june\u00a030, 2010, the total notional amounts of these foreign exchange contracts purchased and sold were $7.8 billion and $5.3 billion, respectively.  equity  securities held in our equity and other investments portfolio are subject to market price risk.\u00a0market price risk is managed relative to broad-based global and domestic equity indices using certain convertible preferred investments, options, futures, and swap contracts not designated as hedging instruments. from time to time, to hedge our price risk, we may use and designate equity derivatives as hedging instruments, including puts, calls, swaps, and forwards.\u00a0as of june\u00a030, 2011, the total notional amounts of designated and non-designated equity contracts purchased and sold were $1.4 billion and $935 million, respectively. as of june\u00a030, 2010, the total notional amounts of designated and non-designated equity contracts purchased and sold were $918 million and $472 million, respectively.  interest rate  securities held in our fixed-income portfolio are subject to different interest rate risks based on their maturities. we manage the average maturity of our fixed-income portfolio to achieve economic returns that correlate to certain broad-based fixed-income indices using exchange-traded option and futures contracts and over-the-counter swap and option contracts, none of which are designated as hedging instruments. as of june\u00a030, 2011, the total notional amounts of fixed-interest rate contracts purchased and sold were $2.3 billion and $2.2 billion, respectively. as of june\u00a030, 2010, the total notional amounts of fixed-interest rate contracts purchased and sold were $3.1 billion and $1.8 billion, respectively. in addition, we use \u0093to be announced\u0094 forward purchase commitments of mortgage-backed assets to gain exposure to agency mortgage-backed securities.\u00a0these meet the definition of a derivative instrument in cases where physical delivery of the assets is not taken at the earliest available delivery date. as of june\u00a030, 2011 and 2010, the total notional derivative amount of mortgage contracts purchased were $868 million and $305 million, respectively.  credit  our fixed-income portfolio is diversified and consists primarily of investment-grade securities. we use credit default swap contracts, not designated as hedging instruments, to manage credit exposures relative to broad-based indices and to facilitate portfolio diversification. we use credit default swaps as they are a low cost method of managing  \u00a0 59  table of contents  \u00a0  part ii  item 8  \u00a0 \u00a0  exposure to individual credit risks or groups of credit risks. as of june\u00a030, 2011, the total notional amounts of credit contracts purchased and sold were $532 million and $277 million, respectively. as of june\u00a030, 2010, the total notional amounts of credit contracts purchased and sold were $371 million and $199 million, respectively.  commodity  we use broad-based commodity exposures to enhance portfolio returns and to facilitate portfolio diversification. we use swap, futures and option contracts, not designated as hedging instruments, to generate and manage exposures to broad-based commodity indices. we use derivatives on commodities as they can be low-cost alternatives to the purchase and storage of a variety of commodities, including, but not limited to, precious metals, energy, and grain. as of june\u00a030, 2011, the total notional amounts of commodity contracts purchased and sold were $1.9 billion and $502 million, respectively. as of june\u00a030, 2010, the total notional amounts of commodity contracts purchased and sold were $1.1 billion and $376 million, respectively.  credit risk-related contingent features  certain of our counterparty agreements for derivative instruments contain provisions that require our issued and outstanding long-term unsecured debt to maintain an investment grade credit rating and require us to maintain a minimum liquidity of $1.0 billion. to the extent we fail to meet these requirements, we will be required to post collateral, similar to the standard convention related to over-the-counter derivatives. as of june\u00a030, 2011, our long-term unsecured debt rating was aaa, and cash investments were in excess of $1.0 billion. as a result, no collateral was required to be posted.  fair values of derivative instruments  following are the gross fair values of derivative instruments designated as hedging instruments (\u0093designated hedge derivatives\u0094) and not designated as hedging instruments (\u0093non-designated hedge derivatives\u0094) that were held at june\u00a030, 2011 and 2010. the fair values exclude the impact of netting derivative assets and liabilities when a legally enforceable master netting agreement exists and fair value adjustments related to our own credit risk and counterparty credit risk.  \u00a0 \u00a0 60  table of contents

the following gains (losses) related to fair value hedges and their related hedged items:  \u00a0 \u00a0 61  table of contents  \u00a0  part ii  item 8  \u00a0 \u00a0 cash flow hedge gains (losses)  we recognized the following gains (losses) related to foreign exchange contracts designated as cash flow hedges (our only cash flow hedges during the periods reported):  \u00a0  we estimate that $186 million of net derivative losses included in oci at june\u00a030, 2011 will be reclassified into earnings within the following 12 months. no significant amounts of gains (losses) were reclassified from oci into earnings as a result of forecasted transactions that failed to occur during fiscal year 2011.  non-designated derivative gains (losses)  gains (losses) from changes in fair values of derivatives that are not designated as hedges are primarily recognized in other income (expense). these amounts are shown in the table below, with the exception of gains (losses) on derivatives presented in income statement line items other than other income (expense), which were immaterial for all periods presented. other than those derivatives entered into for investment purposes, such as commodity contracts, the gains (losses) below are generally economically offset by unrealized gains (losses) in the underlying available-for-sale securities.  \u00a0 \u00a0 62  table of contents  \u00a0  part ii  item 8  \u00a0 \u00a0 note 6 - fair value measurements  assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis  the following tables present the fair value of our financial instruments that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis:  \u00a0  \u00a0 \u00a0 63  table of contents  \u00a0  part ii  item 8  \u00a0 \u00a0 the table below reconciles the total net fair value of assets above to the balance sheet presentation of these same assets in note 4 \u0096 investments for june\u00a030, 2011 and 2010.  \u00a0 changes in financial instruments measured at level 3 fair value on a recurring basis  the following tables present the changes during the fiscal years 2011 and 2010 in our level 3 financial instruments that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis. the majority of these instruments consist of investment securities classified as available-for-sale with changes in fair value included in oci.  \u00a0  assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis  during fiscal years 2011 and 2010, impairment charges of $2 million and $5 million, respectively, were recognized for certain investments measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis, as the decline in their respective fair values below their cost was determined to be other than temporary in all instances. at june\u00a030, 2011 and 2010, we held no common and preferred stocks that were required to be measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis.  \u00a0 64  table of contents  \u00a0  part ii  item 8  \u00a0 \u00a0 note 7 - inventories  the components of inventories were as follows:  \u00a0 note 8 - property and equipment  the components of property and equipment were as follows:  \u00a0 during fiscal years 2011, 2010, and 2009, depreciation expense was $2.0 billion, $1.8 billion, and $1.7 billion, respectively.  note 9 - business combinations  during fiscal year 2011, we acquired three entities for total consideration of $75 million, substantially all of which was paid in cash. during fiscal year 2010, we acquired five entities for total consideration of $267 million, substantially all of which was paid in cash. during fiscal year 2010, we also sold three entities for total consideration of $600 million, including razorfish in the second quarter of fiscal year 2010. during fiscal year 2009, we acquired nine entities for total consideration of $925 million, substantially all of which was paid in cash. these entities have been included in or removed from our consolidated results of operations since their acquisition or sale dates, respectively. pro forma results of operations have not been presented because the effects of these business combinations, individually and in the aggregate, were not material to our consolidated results of operations.  definitive agreement with skype  on may\u00a010, 2011, we announced that we had entered into a definitive agreement with skype global s.\u00e0.r.l. (\u0093skype\u0094) under which we would acquire skype, a leading internet communications company, for $8.5 billion in cash. the acquisition will extend skype\u0092s brand and reach of its network platform, while enhancing our existing portfolio of real-time communications products and services. the acquisition is subject to regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions. we obtained regulatory approval in the u.s. and expect to obtain all remaining required regulatory approvals during calendar year 2011.  \u00a0 65  table of contents  \u00a0  part ii  item 8  \u00a0 \u00a0 note 10 - goodwill  changes in the carrying amount of goodwill for fiscal years 2011 and 2010 by segment were as follows:  \u00a0 none of the amounts recorded as goodwill are expected to be deductible for tax purposes. the measurement period for purchase price allocations ends as soon as information on the facts and circumstances becomes available, but will not exceed 12 months. adjustments in the purchase price allocation may require a recasting of the amounts allocated to goodwill retroactive to the period in which the acquisition occurred. any change in the goodwill amounts resulting from foreign currency translations are presented as \u0093other\u0094 in the above table. also included within \u0093other\u0094 for fiscal year 2010 is $285 million of goodwill associated with business dispositions. see also note 9 \u0096 business combinations.  we test goodwill for impairment annually on may\u00a01 at the reporting unit level using a fair value approach. no impairment of goodwill was identified as of may\u00a01, 2011.  note 11 - intangible assets  the components of intangible assets, all of which are finite-lived, were as follows:  \u00a0 \u00a0 we estimate that we have no significant residual value related to our intangible assets. no material impairments of intangible assets were identified during any of the periods presented.  \u00a0 66  table of contents  \u00a0  part ii  item 8  \u00a0 \u00a0 the components of intangible assets acquired during fiscal years 2011 and 2010 were as follows:  \u00a0 intangible assets amortization expense was $537 million, $707 million, and $591 million for fiscal years 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively. amortization of capitalized software was $114 million, $97 million, and $65 million for fiscal years 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively.  the following table outlines the estimated future amortization expense related to intangible assets held at june\u00a030, 2011:  \u00a0 note 12 - debt  short-term debt  during fiscal year 2011, we repaid $1.0 billion of commercial paper, leaving zero outstanding.  on november\u00a05, 2010, our $1.0 billion 364-day credit facility expired. this facility served as a back-up for our commercial paper program. no amounts were drawn against the credit facility during any of the periods presented.  long-term debt  as of june\u00a030, 2011, the total carrying value and estimated fair value of our long-term debt, including convertible debt, were $11.9 billion and $12.1 billion, respectively. this is compared to a carrying value and estimated fair value of $4.9 billion and $5.2 billion, respectively, as of june 30, 2010. the estimated fair value is based on quoted prices for our publicly-traded debt as of june\u00a030, 2011 and 2010, as applicable.  maturities of long-term debt for each of the next five years and thereafter are as follows:  \u00a0 \u00a0 67  table of contents  \u00a0  part ii  item 8  \u00a0 \u00a0 cash paid for interest on our debt for fiscal years 2011 and 2010 was $197 million and $145 million, respectively. no cash was paid for debt interest for fiscal year 2009.  the components of long-term debt, the associated interest rates, and the semi-annual interest record and payment dates were as follows as of june\u00a030, 2011:  \u00a0 the components of long-term debt, the associated interest rates, and the semi-annual interest record and payment dates were as follows as of june\u00a030, 2010:  \u00a0 notes  the notes are senior unsecured obligations and rank equally with our other unsecured and unsubordinated debt outstanding.  \u00a0 68  table of contents  \u00a0  part ii  item 8  \u00a0 \u00a0 convertible debt  in june 2010, we issued $1.25 billion of zero coupon convertible unsecured debt due on june\u00a015, 2013 in a private placement offering. proceeds from the offering were $1.24 billion, net of fees and expenses, which were capitalized.  each $1,000 principal amount of notes is convertible into 29.94 shares of microsoft common stock at a conversion price of $33.40 per share. as of june\u00a030, 2011, the net carrying amount of our convertible debt was $1.2 billion and the unamortized discount was $38 million.  prior to march\u00a015, 2013, the notes will be convertible, only in certain circumstances, into cash and, if applicable, cash, shares of microsoft\u0092s common stock, or a combination thereof, at our election. on or after march\u00a015, 2013, the notes will be convertible at any time. upon conversion, we will pay cash up to the aggregate principal amount of the notes and pay or deliver cash, shares of our common stock, or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock, at our election.  because the convertible debt may be wholly or partially settled in cash, we are required to separately account for the liability and equity components of the notes in a manner that reflects our nonconvertible debt borrowing rate when interest costs are recognized in subsequent periods. the net proceeds of $1.24 billion were allocated between debt for $1.18 billion and stockholders\u0092 equity for $58 million with the portion in stockholders\u0092 equity representing the fair value of the option to convert the debt.  in connection with the issuance of the notes, we entered into capped call transactions with certain option counterparties who are initial purchasers of the notes or their affiliates. the capped call transactions are expected to reduce potential dilution of earnings per share upon conversion of the notes. under the capped call transactions, we purchased from the option counterparties capped call options that in the aggregate relate to the total number of shares of our common stock underlying the notes, with a strike price equal to the conversion price of the notes and with a cap price equal to $37.16. the purchased capped calls were valued at $40 million and recorded to stockholders\u0092 equity.  note 13 - income taxes  the components of the provision for income taxes were as follows:  \u00a0 u.s. and international components of income before income taxes were as follows:  \u00a0 \u00a0 69  table of contents  \u00a0  part ii  item 8  \u00a0 \u00a0 the items accounting for the difference between income taxes computed at the u.s. federal statutory rate and our effective rate were as follows:  \u00a0 the reduction from the federal statutory rate from foreign earnings taxed at lower rates results from producing and distributing our products and services through our foreign regional operations centers in ireland, singapore, and puerto rico, which are subject to lower income tax rates. in general, other reconciling items consist of interest, u.s. state income taxes, domestic production deductions, and credits. in fiscal years 2011, 2010, and 2009, there were no individually significant other reconciling items. the i.r.s. settlement is discussed below.  the components of the deferred income tax assets and liabilities were as follows:  \u00a0 deferred income tax balances reflect the effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases and are stated at enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when the taxes are actually paid or recovered.  we have not provided deferred u.s. income taxes or foreign withholding taxes on temporary differences of approximately $44.8 billion resulting from earnings for certain non-u.s. subsidiaries which are permanently reinvested outside the u.s. the unrecognized deferred tax liability associated with these temporary differences is approximately $14.2 billion.  income taxes paid were $5.3 billion, $4.1 billion, and $6.6 billion in fiscal years 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively.  \u00a0 70  table of contents  \u00a0  part ii  item 8  \u00a0 \u00a0 uncertain tax positions  as of june\u00a030, 2011, we had $6.9 billion of unrecognized tax benefits of which $5.9 billion, if recognized, would affect our effective tax rate. as of june\u00a030, 2010, we had $6.5 billion of unrecognized tax benefits of which $5.6 billion, if recognized, would have affected our effective tax rate.  interest on unrecognized tax benefits was $38 million, $193 million, and $230 million in fiscal years 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively. as of june\u00a030, 2011, 2010, and 2009, we had accrued interest related to uncertain tax positions of $785 million, $747 million, and $554 million, respectively, net of federal income tax benefits.  the aggregate changes in the balance of unrecognized tax benefits were as follows:  \u00a0 during the third quarter of fiscal year 2011, we reached a partial settlement agreement with the i.r.s. on tax years 2004 to 2006 and recorded a $461 million income tax provision benefit. during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2011, the i.r.s. completed its examination and issued a revenue agent\u0092s report (\u0093rar\u0094) for the remaining unresolved items. we do not agree with the adjustments in the rar, and we have filed a protest to initiate the administrative appeals process. the proposed adjustments are primarily related to transfer pricing and could have a significant impact on our financial statements if not resolved favorably. we do not believe it is reasonably possible that the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits will significantly increase or decrease within the next 12 months, as we do not believe the appeals process will be concluded within the next 12 months. we also continue to be subject to examination by the i.r.s. for tax years 2007 to 2010.  we are subject to income tax in many jurisdictions outside the u.s., and certain jurisdictions remain subject to examination and are currently under audit by local tax authorities. the resolutions of these audits are not expected to be material to our financial statements.  note 14 - unearned revenue  unearned revenue comprises mainly unearned revenue from volume licensing programs, as well as payments for offerings for which we have been paid in advance and we earn the revenue when we provide the service or software or otherwise meet the revenue recognition criteria.  volume licensing programs  unearned revenue from volume licensing programs represents customer billings for multi-year licensing arrangements paid either at inception of the agreement or annually at the beginning of each billing coverage period and accounted for as subscriptions with revenue recognized ratably over the billing coverage period.  other  also included in unearned revenue are payments for post-delivery support and consulting services to be performed in the future; xbox live subscriptions and prepaid points; microsoft dynamics business solutions products; technology guarantee programs; oem minimum commitments; unspecified upgrades or enhancements of microsoft internet explorer on a when-and-if-available basis for windows xp; and other offerings for which we have been paid in advance and earn the revenue when we provide the service or software or otherwise meet the revenue recognition criteria.  \u00a0 71  table of contents  \u00a0  part ii  item 8  \u00a0 \u00a0 the components of unearned revenue were as follows:  \u00a0 unearned revenue by segment was as follows:  \u00a0 note 15 - other long-term liabilities  \u00a0 note 16 - commitments and guarantees  construction and operating leases  we have committed $263 million for constructing new buildings, building improvements and leasehold improvements as of june\u00a030, 2011.  we have operating leases for most u.s. and international sales and support offices and certain equipment. rental expense for facilities operating leases was $525 million, $530 million, and $475 million, in fiscal years 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively. future minimum rental commitments under noncancellable facilities operating leases in place as of june\u00a030, 2011 are as follows:  \u00a0 \u00a0 72  table of contents  \u00a0  part ii  item 8  \u00a0 \u00a0 indemnifications  we provide indemnifications of varying scope and size to certain customers against claims of intellectual property infringement made by third parties arising from the use of our products and certain other matters. we evaluate estimated losses for these indemnifications, and we consider such factors as the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss. to date, we have not encountered significant costs as a result of these obligations and have not accrued any liabilities related to these indemnifications in our financial statements.  yahoo! commercial agreement  on december\u00a04, 2009, we entered into a definitive agreement with yahoo! whereby microsoft will provide the exclusive algorithmic and paid search platform for yahoo! web sites. the term of the agreement is 10 years subject to termination provisions after five years based on performance.  microsoft provided yahoo! with revenue per search guarantees for a period of 18 months after implementation of the microsoft search ads platform in each country. these guarantees are calculated, paid and trued-up periodically based on the cumulative reduction in revenue per search, if any, during the 18-month period from pre-implementation levels, except in the case of the u.s. and canada where performance during each of the first two calendar quarters after implementation is independent and not cumulative. this is a rate guarantee and not a guarantee of search volume. we estimate the total cost of the revenue per search guarantees during the guarantee period could range up to $150 million.  microsoft also agreed to reimburse yahoo! for certain transition expenses incurred both before and after the effective date of the agreement.  finally, microsoft also agreed to reimburse yahoo! for certain costs of running algorithmic and paid search services prior to migration to microsoft\u0092s platform.  product warranty  the changes in our aggregate product warranty liabilities, which are included in other current liabilities and other long term-liabilities on our balance sheets, were as follows:  \u00a0 note 17 - contingencies  government competition law matters  since 2001, we have been subject to a consent decree and final judgment (\u0093final judgments\u0094) that resolved lawsuits brought by the u.s. department of justice, 18 states, and the district of columbia in two separate actions. the final judgments imposed various constraints on our windows operating system businesses. the final judgments expired in may 2011.  in other ongoing investigations, various foreign governments and several state attorneys general have requested information from us concerning competition, privacy, and security issues.  \u00a0 73  table of contents  \u00a0  part ii  item 8  \u00a0 \u00a0 antitrust, unfair competition, and overcharge class actions  a large number of antitrust and unfair competition class action lawsuits were filed against us in various state, federal, and canadian courts on behalf of various classes of direct and indirect purchasers of our pc operating system and certain other software products. we obtained dismissals of damages claims of indirect purchasers under federal law and in 15 states. courts refused to certify classes in two additional states. we have reached agreements to settle all claims that have been made to date in 19 states and the district of columbia.  the settlements in all states have received final court approval. under the settlements, generally class members can obtain vouchers that entitle them to be reimbursed for purchases of a wide variety of platform-neutral computer hardware and software. the total value of vouchers that we may issue varies by state. we will make available to certain schools a percentage of those vouchers that are not issued or claimed (one-half to two-thirds depending on the state). the total value of vouchers we ultimately issue will depend on the number of class members who make claims and are issued vouchers. the maximum value of vouchers to be issued is approximately $2.7 billion. the actual costs of these settlements will be less than that maximum amount, depending on the number of class members and schools that are issued and redeem vouchers. we estimate the total cost to resolve all of the state overcharge class action cases will range between $1.9 billion and $2.0 billion. at june\u00a030, 2011, we have recorded a liability related to these claims of approximately $568 million, which reflects our estimated exposure of $1.9 billion less payments made to date of approximately $1.3 billion mostly for vouchers, legal fees, and administrative expenses.  the three cases pending in british columbia, ontario, and quebec, canada have not been settled. in march 2010, the court in the british columbia case certified it as a class action. on april\u00a015, 2011, the british columbia court of appeal reversed the class certification ruling and dismissed the case, holding that indirect purchasers do not have a claim. the plaintiffs have sought review by the canadian supreme court. the other two actions have been stayed.  other antitrust litigation and claims  in november 2004, novell, inc. (\u0093novell\u0094) filed a complaint in u.s. district court for the district of utah (later transferred to federal court in maryland), asserting antitrust and unfair competition claims against us related to novell\u0092s ownership of wordperfect and other productivity applications during the period between june 1994 and march 1996. in june 2005, the trial court granted our motion to dismiss four of six claims of the complaint. in march\u00a02010 the trial court granted summary judgment in favor of microsoft as to all remaining claims. the court of appeals has reversed that ruling, and the case is scheduled for trial in utah in october 2011.  patent and intellectual property claims  in 2003, we filed an action in u.s. district court in california seeking a declaratory judgment that we do not infringe certain alcatel-lucent patents (although this action began before the merger of alcatel and lucent in 2006, for simplicity we refer to the post-merger entity of alcatel-lucent). in april 2008, a jury returned a verdict in alcatel-lucent\u0092s favor in a trial on a consolidated group of one video and three user interface patents. the jury concluded that we had infringed two user interface patents and awarded $367 million in damages. in june 2008, the trial judge increased the amount of damages to $512 million to include $145 million of interest. we appealed that award. in december 2008, we entered into a settlement agreement resolving all other litigation pending between microsoft and alcatel-lucent, leaving approximately $500 million remaining in dispute. in september\u00a02009, the court of appeals affirmed the liability award but vacated the verdict and remanded the case to the trial court for a re-trial of the damages ruling, indicating the damages previously awarded were too high. trial on the remanded damages claim was held in july 2011.  in october 2003, uniloc usa inc. (\u0093uniloc\u0094), a subsidiary of a singapore-based company, filed a patent infringement suit in u.s. district court in rhode island, claiming that product activation technology supporting windows xp and certain other microsoft programs violated a uniloc patent. after we obtained a favorable summary judgment that we did not infringe any of the claims of this patent, the court of appeals vacated the trial court decision and remanded  \u00a0 74  table of contents  \u00a0  part ii  item 8  \u00a0 \u00a0  the case for trial. in april 2009, the jury returned a $388 million verdict against us, including a finding of willful infringement. in september\u00a02009, the district court judge overturned the jury verdict, ruling that the evidence did not support the jury\u0092s findings either that microsoft infringed the patent or was willful. uniloc appealed, and in january 2011 the court of appeals reversed the district court\u0092s finding of non-infringement (thus reinstating the jury verdict of infringement) but affirmed the district court\u0092s ruling that microsoft was not willful and affirmed the district court\u0092s grant of a new trial on damages.\u00a0uniloc\u0092s petition for rehearing of the court of appeals\u0092 decision as to damages was denied. a new trial on damages has been set for january 2012.  in march 2007, i4i limited partnership (\u0093i4i\u0094) sued microsoft in u.s. district court in texas claiming that certain custom xml technology in word 2003 and 2007 infringed i4i\u0092s patent. in may 2009, a jury returned a verdict against us, finding damages of $200 million and that we willfully infringed the patent. in august 2009, the court denied our post-trial motions and awarded enhanced damages of $40 million and prejudgment interest of $37\u00a0million. the court also issued a permanent injunction prohibiting additional distribution of the allegedly infringing technology. we appealed and the appellate court stayed the injunction pending our appeal. in december\u00a02009, the court of appeals rejected our appeal and affirmed the trial court\u0092s judgment and injunction, except that the court of appeals modified the effective date of the injunction to january\u00a011, 2010. we appealed to the u.s. supreme court, and in june 2011 the court affirmed the judgment of the court of appeals.  in october 2010, we filed suit against motorola with the international trade commission (\u0093itc\u0094) and in u.s. district court in washington for infringement of nine microsoft patents by motorola\u0092s android-based devices. since then, microsoft and motorola have filed additional actions against each other in the itc and federal courts in washington, wisconsin, florida, and california. microsoft asserts motorola\u0092s android-based devices violate 23 of its patents, and motorola asserts various microsoft products (including windows, windows phone 7, windows mobile 6.5, xbox, bing maps, hotmail, messenger, and exchange server) violate 21 motorola patents. microsoft also claims motorola has breached its contractual commitments to the institute of electrical and electronics engineers (\u0093ieee\u0094) and international telecommunications union (\u0093itu\u0094) to license identified patents related to wireless and video coding technologies under reasonable and non-discriminatory (\u0093rand\u0094) terms and conditions. motorola asserts that microsoft breached contractual commitments to the sd card association to license two patents under rand terms and conditions, and asserts federal antitrust and state unfair business practice claims.\u00a0trial in our itc case is set for august 2011, trial in motorola\u0092s itc case is set for october 2011, and trial of both parties\u0092 patent infringement claims in florida also is set for october 2011.  in addition to these cases, there are approximately 55 other patent infringement cases pending against microsoft.  other  we also are subject to a variety of other claims and suits that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of our business. although management currently believes that resolving claims against us, individually or in aggregate, will not have a material adverse impact on our financial statements, these matters are subject to inherent uncertainties and management\u0092s view of these matters may change in the future.  as of june\u00a030, 2011, we had accrued aggregate liabilities of $693 million in other current liabilities and $276 million in other long-term liabilities for all of the contingent matters described in this note. while we intend to vigorously defend these matters, there exists the possibility of adverse outcomes that we estimate could reach approximately $800 million in aggregate beyond recorded amounts. were unfavorable final outcomes to occur, there exists the possibility of a material adverse impact on our financial statements for the period in which the effects become reasonably estimable.  \u00a0 75  table of contents  \u00a0  part ii  item 8  \u00a0 \u00a0 note 18 - stockholders\u0092 equity  shares outstanding  shares of common stock outstanding were as follows:  \u00a0 share repurchases  on september\u00a022, 2008, we announced the completion of the two repurchase programs approved by our board of directors during the first quarter of fiscal year 2007 to buy back up to $40.0 billion of microsoft common stock. on september\u00a022, 2008, we also announced that our board of directors approved a new share repurchase program authorizing up to $40.0 billion in share repurchases with an expiration date of september\u00a030, 2013. as of june\u00a030, 2011, approximately $12.2 billion remained of the $40.0 billion approved repurchase amount. the repurchase program may be suspended or discontinued at any time without prior notice.  we repurchased the following shares of common stock under the above-described repurchase plans using cash

\u00a0 note 20 - employee stock and savings plans  we grant stock-based compensation to directors and employees. at june\u00a030, 2011, an aggregate of 583\u00a0million shares were authorized for future grant under our stock plans, covering stock options, stock awards, and shared performance stock awards, and excluding shares reserved for issuance under our employee stock purchase plan. awards that expire or are canceled without delivery of shares generally become available for issuance under the plans. we issue new shares of microsoft common stock to satisfy exercises and vestings of awards granted under all of our stock plans.  \u00a0 77  table of contents  \u00a0  part ii  item 8  \u00a0 \u00a0 stock-based compensation expense and related income tax benefits were as follows:  \u00a0  stock plans (excluding stock options)  stock awards  stock awards (\u0093sas\u0094) are grants that entitle the holder to shares of microsoft common stock as the award vests. our sas generally vest over a five-year period.  shared performance stock awards  shared performance stock awards (\u0093spsas\u0094) are a form of sa in which the number of shares ultimately received depends on our business performance against specified performance targets.  we granted spsas for fiscal years 2011, 2010, and 2009 with performance periods of july\u00a01, 2010 through june\u00a030, 2011,\u00a0july\u00a01, 2009 through june\u00a030, 2010, and july\u00a01, 2008 through june\u00a030, 2009, respectively. in august following the end of each performance period, the number of shares of stock subject to the award is determined by multiplying the target award by a percentage ranging from 0% to 150%. the percentage is based on performance metrics for the performance period, as determined by the compensation committee of the board of directors in its sole discretion. an additional number of shares, approximately 12% of the total target spsas, are available as additional awards to participants based on individual performance. one-quarter of the shares of stock subject to each award vest following the end of the performance period, and an additional one-quarter of the shares vest on each of the following three anniversaries of the grant date.  executive officer incentive plan  under the executive officer incentive plan (\u0093eoip\u0094), the compensation committee awards performance-based compensation to executive officers of the company for specified performance periods.\u00a0during the periods reported, executive officers were eligible to receive annual awards comprised of cash and sas from an aggregate incentive pool equal to a percentage of the company\u0092s operating income. for fiscal years 2011, 2010, and 2009, the pool was 0.25%, 0.45%, and 0.35% of operating income, respectively.  in september following the end of the fiscal year, each executive officer may receive a combined cash and sa award with a total value equal to a fixed percentage of the aggregate pool. the fixed percentage ranges between 0% and 150% of a target based on an assessment of the executive officer\u0092s performance during the prior fiscal year. following approval of the awards, 20% of the award is payable to the executive officers in cash, and the remaining 80% is converted into an sa for shares of microsoft common stock. the number of shares subject to the sa portion of the award is determined by dividing the value of 80% of the total award by the closing price of microsoft common stock on the last business day in august\u00a0of each year. the sa portion of the award vests one-quarter immediately after the award is approved following fiscal year-end\u00a0and one-quarter on august\u00a031 of each of the following three years.  activity for all stock plans  the fair value of each award is estimated on the date of grant using the following assumptions:  \u00a0  \u00a0 78  table of contents  \u00a0  part ii  item 8  \u00a0 \u00a0 during fiscal year 2011, the following activity occurred under our stock plans:  \u00a0 as of june\u00a030, 2011, there was $4.5 billion and $467 million of total unrecognized compensation costs related to sas and spsas, respectively. these costs are expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 3.3 years and 2.5 years, respectively.  during fiscal year 2010 and 2009, the following activity occurred under our stock plans:  \u00a0  following are the fair values of stock plan awards vested during the periods reported:  \u00a0  stock options  we grant stock options primarily in conjunction with business acquisitions. we granted zero, one\u00a0million, and one\u00a0million stock options in conjunction with business acquisitions during fiscal years 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively. options generally vest over four and one-half years and expire 10 years from the date of grant.  \u00a0 79  table of contents  \u00a0  part ii  item 8  \u00a0 \u00a0 employee stock options activity during 2011 was as follows:  \u00a0  options outstanding as of june\u00a030, 2011 include approximately two\u00a0million options that were granted in conjunction with business acquisitions. these options have an exercise price range of $0.01 to $29.24 and a weighted average exercise price of $7.69.  during the periods reported, the following stock option exercise activity occurred:  \u00a0

\u00a0 \u00a0 note 21 - segment information and geographic data  in its operation of the business, management, including our chief operating decision maker, the company\u0092s chief executive officer, reviews certain financial information, including segmented internal profit and loss statements prepared on a basis not consistent with u.s. gaap. the segment information within this note is reported on that basis. our five segments are windows\u00a0& windows live division; server and tools; online services division; microsoft business division; and entertainment and devices division.  due to the integrated structure of our business, certain revenue earned and costs incurred by one segment may benefit other segments. revenue on certain contracts may be allocated among the segments based on the relative value of the underlying products and services. costs that are identifiable are allocated to the segments that benefit to incent cross-collaboration among our segments so that one segment is not solely burdened by the cost of a mutually beneficial activity. allocated costs may include those relating to development and marketing of products and services from which multiple segments benefit, or those costs relating to services performed by one segment on behalf of other segments. each allocation is measured differently based on the specific facts and circumstances of the costs being allocated.  in addition, certain costs incurred at a corporate level that are identifiable and that benefit our segments are allocated to them. these allocated costs include costs of: field selling; employee benefits; shared facilities services; and customer service and support. each allocation is measured differently based on the specific facts and circumstances of the costs being allocated. certain other corporate-level activity is not allocated to our segments, including costs of: broad-based sales and marketing; product support services; human resources; legal; finance; information technology; corporate development and procurement activities; research and development; legal settlements and contingencies; and employee severance.  we have recast certain prior period amounts within this note to conform to the way we internally managed and monitored segment performance during the current fiscal year, including moving microsoft\u0092s pc hardware business from entertainment and devices division to windows\u00a0& windows live division, windows embedded from entertainment and devices division to server and tools, and office for mac from entertainment and devices division to microsoft business division, as well as implementing intersegment cost allocations between all segments related to the collaborative investment in mobile platform development.  the principal products and services provided by each segment are summarized below:  windows\u00a0& windows live division \u0096 windows\u00a0& windows live division offerings consist of multiple editions of the windows operating system, software and services through windows live, and microsoft pc hardware products.  server and tools \u0096 server and tools product and service offerings include windows

segment revenue and operating income (loss) were as follows during the periods presented:  \u00a0 \u00a0 reconciling amounts in the tables above and below include adjustments to conform our internal accounting policies to u.s. gaap and corporate-level activity not specifically attributed to a segment. significant internal accounting policies that differ from u.s. gaap relate to revenue recognition, income statement classification, depreciation, and amortization of stock-based awards.  significant reconciling items were as follows:  \u00a0 \u00a0 no sales to an individual customer accounted for more than 10% of fiscal year 2011, 2010, or 2009 revenue. revenue, classified by the major geographic areas in which our customers are located, was as follows:  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 82  table of contents  \u00a0  part ii  item 8  \u00a0 \u00a0 revenue from external customers, classified by significant product and service offerings were as follows:  \u00a0 assets are not allocated to segments for internal reporting presentations. a portion of amortization and depreciation is included with various other costs in an overhead allocation to each segment and it is impracticable for us

registered public accounting firm  to the board of directors and stockholders of microsoft corporation:  we have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of microsoft corporation and subsidiaries (the \u0093company\u0094) as of june\u00a030, 2011 and 2010, and the related consolidated statements of income, cash flows, and stockholders\u0092 equity for each of the three years in the period ended june\u00a030, 2011.\u00a0these financial statements are the responsibility of the company\u0092s management. our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.  we conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board (united states).\u00a0those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.\u00a0an audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.\u00a0an audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. we believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.  in our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of microsoft corporation and subsidiaries as of june\u00a030, 2011 and 2010, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended june\u00a030, 2011, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america.  we have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board (united states), the company\u0092s internal control over financial reporting as of june\u00a030, 2011, based on the criteria established in internal control \u0096 integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission and our report dated july\u00a028, 2011, expressed an unqualified opinion on the company\u0092s

1a \u00a0 business model competition  companies compete with us based on a growing variety of business models.        the competitive pressures described above may cause decreased sales volumes, price reductions, and/or increased operating costs, such as for research and development, marketing, and sales incentives. this may lead to lower revenue, gross margins, and operating income.  our increasing focus on cloud-based services presents execution and competitive risks.\u00a0a growing part of our business involves cloud-based services available across the spectrum of computing devices. our strategic vision is to compete and grow by building best-in-class platforms and productivity services for an intelligent cloud and an intelligent edge infused with artificial intelligence (\u201cai\u201d). at the same time, our competitors are rapidly developing and deploying cloud-based services for consumers and business customers. pricing and delivery models are evolving. devices and form factors influence how users access services in the cloud and sometimes the user\u2019s choice of which cloud-based services to use. we are devoting significant resources to develop and deploy our cloud-based strategies. the windows ecosystem must continue to evolve with this changing environment. we embrace cultural and organizational changes to drive accountability and eliminate obstacles to innovation. our intelligent cloud and intelligent edge worldview is connected with the growth of the internet of things (\u201ciot\u201d). our success in the iot will depend on the level of adoption of our offerings such as azure, azure stack, azure iot edge, and azure sphere. we may not establish market share sufficient to achieve scale necessary to meet our business objectives. besides software development costs, we are incurring costs to build and maintain infrastructure to support cloud computing services. these costs will reduce the operating margins we have previously achieved. whether we succeed in cloud-based services depends on our execution in several areas, including:            it is uncertain whether our strategies will attract the users or generate the revenue required to succeed. if we are not effective in executing organizational and technical changes to increase efficiency and accelerate innovation, or if we fail to generate sufficient usage of our new products and services, we may not grow revenue in line with the infrastructure and development investments described above. this may negatively impact gross margins and operating income.  24part i item 1a \u00a0 risks relating to the evolution of our business we make significant investments in products and services that may not achieve expected returns.\u00a0we will continue to make significant investments in research, development, and marketing for existing products, services, and technologies, including the windows operating system, microsoft 365, office, bing, sql server, windows server, azure, office 365, xbox, linkedin, and other products and services. we also invest in the development and acquisition of a variety of hardware for productivity, communication, and entertainment including pcs, tablets, gaming devices, and hololens. investments in new technology are speculative. commercial success depends on many factors, including innovativeness, developer support, and effective distribution and marketing. if customers do not perceive our latest offerings as providing significant new functionality or other value, they may reduce their purchases of new software and hardware products or upgrades, unfavorably affecting revenue. we may not achieve significant revenue from new product, service, and distribution channel investments for several years, if at all. new products and services may not be profitable, and even if they are profitable, operating margins for some new products and businesses will not be as high as the margins we have experienced historically. we may not get engagement in certain features, like edge and bing, that drive post-sale monetization opportunities. our data handling practices across our products and services will continue to be under scrutiny and perceptions of mismanagement, driven by regulatory activity or negative public reaction to our practices or product experiences, could negatively impact product and feature adoption, product design, and product quality. developing new technologies is complex. it can require long development and testing periods. significant delays in new releases or significant problems in creating new products or services could adversely affect our revenue.  acquisitions, joint ventures, and strategic alliances may have an adverse effect on our business.\u00a0we expect to continue making acquisitions and entering into joint ventures and strategic alliances as part of our long-term business strategy. for example, in march 2021 we completed our acquisition of zenimax media inc. for $8.1 billion, and in march 2022 we completed our acquisition of nuance communications, inc. for $18.8 billion. in january 2022 we announced a definitive agreement to acquire activision blizzard, inc. for $68.7 billion.\u00a0these acquisitions and other transactions and arrangements involve significant challenges and risks, including that they do not advance our business strategy, that we get an unsatisfactory return on our investment, that they raise new compliance-related obligations and challenges, that we have difficulty integrating and retaining new employees, business systems, and technology, that they distract management from our other businesses, or that announced transactions may not be completed. if an arrangement fails to adequately anticipate changing circumstances and interests of a party, it may result in early termination or renegotiation of the arrangement. the success of these transactions and arrangements will depend in part on our ability to leverage them to enhance our existing products and services or develop compelling new ones, as well as acquired companies\u2019 ability to meet our policies and processes in areas such as data governance, privacy, and cybersecurity. it may take longer than expected to realize the full benefits from these transactions and arrangements such as increased revenue or enhanced efficiencies, or the benefits may ultimately be smaller than we expected. these events could adversely affect our consolidated financial statements.  if our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets become impaired, we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings.\u00a0we acquire other companies and intangible assets and may not realize all the economic benefit from those acquisitions, which could cause an impairment of goodwill or intangibles. we review our amortizable intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. we test goodwill for impairment at least annually. factors that may be a change in circumstances, indicating that the carrying value of our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets may not be recoverable, include a decline in our stock price and market capitalization, reduced future cash flow estimates, and slower growth rates in industry segments in which we participate. we have in the past recorded, and may in the future be required to record, a significant charge in our consolidated financial statements during the period in which any impairment of our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets is determined, negatively affecting our results of operations.  25part i item 1a \u00a0 cybersecurity, data privacy, and platform abuse risks cyberattacks and security vulnerabilities could lead to reduced revenue, increased costs, liability claims, or harm to our reputation or competitive position.  security of our information technology threats to it security can take a variety of forms. individual and groups of hackers and sophisticated organizations, including state-sponsored organizations or nation-states, continuously undertake attacks that pose threats to our customers and our it.\u00a0these actors may use a wide variety of methods, which may include developing and deploying malicious software or exploiting vulnerabilities in hardware, software, or other infrastructure in order to attack our products and services or gain access to our networks and datacenters, using social engineering techniques to induce our employees, users, partners, or customers to disclose passwords or other sensitive information or take other actions to gain access to our data or our users\u2019 or customers\u2019 data, or acting in a coordinated manner to launch distributed denial of service or other coordinated attacks. nation-state and state-sponsored actors can deploy significant resources to plan and carry out exploits. nation-state attacks against us or our customers may intensify during periods of intense diplomatic or armed conflict, such as the ongoing conflict in ukraine. inadequate account security practices may also result in unauthorized access to confidential data. for example, system administrators may fail to timely remove employee account access when no longer appropriate. employees or third parties may intentionally compromise our or our users\u2019 security or systems or reveal confidential information. malicious actors may employ the it supply chain to introduce malware through software updates or compromised supplier accounts or hardware. cyberthreats are constantly evolving and becoming increasingly sophisticated and complex, increasing the difficulty of detecting and successfully defending against them. we may have no current capability to detect certain vulnerabilities, which may allow them to persist in the environment over long periods of time. cyberthreats can have cascading impacts that unfold with increasing speed across our internal networks and systems and those of our partners and customers. breaches of our facilities, network, or data security could disrupt the security of our systems and business applications, impair our ability to provide services to our customers and protect the privacy of their data, result in product development delays, compromise confidential or technical business information harming our reputation or competitive position, result in theft or misuse of our intellectual property or other assets, subject us to ransomware attacks, require us to allocate more resources to improve technologies or remediate the impacts of attacks, or otherwise adversely affect our business. the cyberattacks uncovered in late 2020 known as \u201csolorigate\u201d or \u201cnobelium\u201d are an example of a supply chain attack where malware was introduced to a software provider\u2019s customers, including us, through software updates. the attackers were later able to create false credentials that appeared legitimate to certain customers\u2019 systems. we may be targets of further attacks similar to solorigate/nobelium as both a supplier and consumer of it. in addition, our internal it environment continues to evolve. often, we are early adopters of new devices and technologies. we embrace new ways of sharing data and communicating internally and with partners and customers using methods such as social networking and other consumer-oriented technologies. our business policies and internal security controls may not keep pace with these changes as new threats emerge, or emerging cybersecurity regulations in jurisdictions worldwide. 26part i item 1a \u00a0 security of our products, services, devices, and customers\u2019 data the security of our products and services is important in our customers\u2019 decisions to purchase or use our products or services across cloud and on-premises environments. security threats are a significant challenge to companies like us whose business is providing technology products and services to others. threats to our own it infrastructure can also affect our customers. customers using our cloud-based services rely on the security of our infrastructure, including hardware and other elements provided by third parties, to ensure the reliability of our services and the protection of their data. adversaries tend to focus their efforts on the most popular operating systems, programs, and services, including many of ours, and we expect that to continue. in addition, adversaries can attack our customers\u2019 on-premises or cloud environments, sometimes exploiting previously unknown (\u201czero day\u201d) vulnerabilities, such as occurred in early calendar year 2021 with several of our exchange server on-premises products. vulnerabilities in these or any product can persist even after we have issued security patches if customers have not installed the most recent updates, or if the attackers exploited the vulnerabilities before patching to install additional malware to further compromise customers\u2019 systems. adversaries will continue to attack customers using our cloud services as customers embrace digital transformation. adversaries that acquire user account information can use that information to compromise our users\u2019 accounts, including where accounts share the same attributes such as passwords. inadequate account security practices may also result in unauthorized access, and user activity may result in ransomware or other malicious software impacting a customer\u2019s use of our products or services. we are increasingly incorporating open source software into our products. there may be vulnerabilities in open source software that may make our products susceptible to cyberattacks. our customers operate complex it systems with third-party hardware and software from multiple vendors that may include systems acquired over many years. they expect our products and services to support all these systems and products, including those that no longer incorporate the strongest current security advances or standards. as a result, we may not be able to discontinue support in our services for a product, service, standard, or feature solely because a more secure alternative is available. failure to utilize the most current security advances and standards can increase our customers\u2019 vulnerability to attack. further, customers of widely varied size and technical sophistication use our technology, and consequently may have limited capabilities and resources to help them adopt and implement state of the art cybersecurity practices and technologies. in addition, we must account for this wide variation of technical sophistication when defining default settings for our products and services, including security default settings, as these settings may limit or otherwise impact other aspects of it operations and some customers may have limited capability to review and reset these defaults. cyberattacks such as solorigate/nobelium may adversely impact our customers even if our production services are not directly compromised. we are committed to notifying our customers whose systems have been impacted as we become aware and have available information and actions for customers to help protect themselves. we are also committed to providing guidance and support on detection, tracking, and remediation. we may not be able to detect the existence or extent of these attacks for all of our customers or have information on how to detect or track an attack, especially where an attack involves on-premises software such as exchange server where we may have no or limited visibility into our customers\u2019 computing environments. development and deployment of defensive measures to defend against security threats to our internal it systems, our cloud-based services, and our customers\u2019 systems, we must continuously engineer more secure products and services, enhance security and reliability features, improve the deployment of software updates to address security vulnerabilities in our own products as well as those provided by others, develop mitigation technologies that help to secure customers from attacks even when software updates are not deployed, maintain the digital security infrastructure that protects the integrity of our network, products, and services, and provide security tools such as firewalls, anti-virus software, and advanced security and information about the need to deploy security measures and the impact of doing so. customers in certain industries such as financial services, health care, and government may have enhanced or specialized requirements to which we must engineer our products and services. 27part i item 1a \u00a0 the cost of measures to protect products and customer-facing services could reduce our operating margins. if we fail to do these things well, actual or perceived security vulnerabilities in our products and services, data corruption issues, or reduced performance could harm our reputation and lead customers to reduce or delay future purchases of products or subscriptions to services, or to use competing products or services. customers may also spend more on protecting their existing computer systems from attack, which could delay adoption of additional products or services. customers, and third parties granted access to their systems, may fail to update their systems, continue to run software or operating systems we no longer support, or may fail timely to install or enable security patches, or may otherwise fail to adopt adequate security practices. any of these could adversely affect our reputation and revenue. actual or perceived vulnerabilities may lead to claims against us. our license agreements typically contain provisions that eliminate or limit our exposure to liability, but there is no assurance these provisions will withstand legal challenges. at times, to achieve commercial objectives, we may enter into agreements with larger liability exposure to customers.  our products operate in conjunction with and are dependent on products and components across a broad ecosystem of third parties. if there is a security vulnerability in one of these components, and if there is a security exploit targeting it, we could face increased costs, liability claims, reduced revenue, or harm to our reputation or competitive position. disclosure and misuse of personal data could result in liability and harm our reputation.\u00a0as we continue to grow the number, breadth, and scale of our cloud-based offerings, we store and process increasingly large amounts of personal data of our customers and users. the continued occurrence of high-profile data breaches provides evidence of an external environment increasingly hostile to information security. despite our efforts to improve the security controls across our business groups and geographies, it is possible our security controls over personal data, our training of employees and third parties on data security, and other practices we follow may not prevent the improper disclosure or misuse of customer or user data we or our vendors store and manage. in addition, third parties who have limited access to our customer or user data may use this data in unauthorized ways. improper disclosure or misuse could harm our reputation, lead to legal exposure to customers or users, or subject us to liability under laws that protect personal data, resulting in increased costs or loss of revenue. our software products and services also enable our customers and users to store and process personal data on-premises or, increasingly, in a cloud-based environment we host. government authorities can sometimes require us to produce customer or user data in response to valid legal orders. in the u.s. and elsewhere, we advocate for transparency concerning these requests and appropriate limitations on government authority to compel disclosure. despite our efforts to protect customer and user data, perceptions that the collection, use, and retention of personal information is not satisfactorily protected could inhibit sales of our products or services and could limit adoption of our cloud-based solutions by consumers, businesses, and government entities. additional security measures we may take to address customer or user concerns, or constraints on our flexibility to determine where and how to operate datacenters in response to customer or user expectations or governmental rules or actions, may cause higher operating expenses or hinder growth of our products and services.  we may not be able to protect information in our products and services from use by others. linkedin and other microsoft products and services contain valuable information and content protected by contractual restrictions or technical measures. in certain cases, we have made commitments to our members and users to limit access to or use of this information. changes in the law or interpretations of the law may weaken our ability to prevent third parties from scraping or gathering information or content through use of bots or other measures and using it for their own benefit, thus diminishing the value of our products and services. abuse of our platforms may harm our reputation or user engagement.  advertising, professional, marketplace, and gaming platform abuses  for platform products and services that provide content or host ads that come from or can be influenced by third parties, including github, linkedin, microsoft advertising, microsoft news, microsoft store, bing, and xbox, our reputation or user engagement may be negatively affected by activity that is hostile or inappropriate. this activity may come from users impersonating other people or organizations, dissemination of information that may be viewed as misleading or intended to manipulate the opinions of our users, or the use of our products or services that violates our terms of service or otherwise for objectionable or illegal ends. preventing or responding to these actions may require us to make substantial investments in people and technology and these investments may not be successful, adversely affecting our business and consolidated financial statements. 28part i item 1a \u00a0 other digital safety abuses our hosted consumer services as well as our enterprise services may be used to disseminate harmful or illegal content in violation of our terms or applicable law. we may not proactively discover such content due to scale, the limitations of existing technologies, and conflicting legal frameworks. when discovered by users, such content may negatively affect our reputation, our brands, and user engagement. regulations and other initiatives to make platforms responsible for preventing or eliminating harmful content online have been enacted, and we expect this to continue. we may be subject to enhanced regulatory oversight, civil or criminal liability, or reputational damage if we fail to comply with content moderation regulations, adversely affecting our business and consolidated financial statements. the development of the iot presents security, privacy, and execution risks. to support the growth of the intelligent cloud and the intelligent edge, we are developing products, services, and technologies to power the iot, a network of distributed and interconnected devices employing sensors, data, and computing capabilities including ai. the iot\u2019s great potential also carries substantial risks. iot products and services may contain defects in design, manufacture, or operation that make them insecure or ineffective for their intended purposes. an iot solution has multiple layers of hardware, sensors, processors, software, and firmware, several of which we may not develop or control. each layer, including the weakest layer, can impact the security of the whole system. many iot devices have limited interfaces and ability to be updated or patched. iot solutions may collect large amounts of data, and our handling of iot data may not satisfy customers or regulatory requirements. iot scenarios may increasingly affect personal health and safety. if iot solutions that include our technologies do not work as intended, violate the law, or harm individuals or businesses, we may be subject to legal claims or enforcement actions. these risks, if realized, may increase our costs, damage our reputation or brands, or negatively impact our revenues or margins.  issues in the development and use of ai may result in reputational harm or liability. we are building ai into many of our offerings, including our productivity services, and we are also making first- and third-party ai available for our customers to use in solutions that they build. we expect these elements of our business to grow. we envision a future in which ai operating in our devices, applications, and the cloud helps our customers be more productive in their work and personal lives. as with many innovations, ai presents risks and challenges that could affect its adoption, and therefore our business. ai algorithms may be flawed. datasets may be insufficient or contain biased information. ineffective or inadequate ai development or deployment practices by microsoft or others could result in incidents that impair the acceptance of ai solutions or cause harm to individuals or society. these deficiencies and other failures of ai systems could subject us to competitive harm, regulatory action, legal liability, including under new proposed legislation regulating ai in jurisdictions such as the european union (\u201ceu\u201d), and brand or reputational harm. some ai scenarios present ethical issues. if we enable or offer ai solutions that are controversial because of their impact on human rights, privacy, employment, or other social, economic, or political issues, we may experience brand or reputational harm.  operational risks we may have excessive outages, data losses, and disruptions of our online services if we fail to maintain an adequate operations infrastructure.\u00a0our increasing user traffic, growth in services, and the complexity of our products and services demand more computing power. we spend substantial amounts to build, purchase, or lease datacenters and equipment and to upgrade our technology and network infrastructure to handle more traffic on our websites and in our datacenters. our datacenters depend on predictable energy and networking supplies, the cost or availability of which could be adversely affected by a variety of factors, including the transition to a clean energy economy and geopolitical disruptions. these demands continue to increase as we introduce new products and services and support the growth of existing services such as bing, azure, microsoft account services, microsoft 365, microsoft teams, dynamics 365, onedrive, sharepoint online, skype, xbox, and outlook.com. we are rapidly growing our business of providing a platform and back-end hosting for services provided by third parties to their end users. maintaining, securing, and expanding this infrastructure is expensive and complex, and requires development of principles for datacenter builds in geographies with higher safety risks. it requires that we maintain an internet connectivity infrastructure and storage and compute capacity that is robust and reliable within competitive and regulatory constraints that continue to evolve. inefficiencies or operational failures, including temporary or permanent loss of customer data, insufficient internet connectivity, or inadequate storage and compute capacity, could diminish the quality of our products, services, and user experience resulting in contractual liability, claims by customers and other third parties, regulatory actions, damage to our reputation, and loss of current and potential users, subscribers, and advertisers, each of which may adversely impact our consolidated financial statements.  29part i item 1a \u00a0 we may experience quality or supply problems.\u00a0our hardware products such as xbox consoles, surface devices, and other devices we design and market are highly complex and can have defects in design, manufacture, or associated software. we could incur significant expenses, lost revenue, and reputational harm as a result of recalls, safety alerts, or product liability claims if we fail to prevent, detect, or address such issues through design, testing, or warranty repairs.  our software products and services also may experience quality or reliability problems. the highly sophisticated software we develop may contain bugs and other defects that interfere with their intended operation. our customers increasingly rely on us for critical business functions and multiple workloads. many of our products and services are interdependent with one another. each of these circumstances potentially magnifies the impact of quality or reliability issues. any defects we do not detect and fix in pre-release testing could cause reduced sales and revenue, damage to our reputation, repair or remediation costs, delays in the release of new products or versions, or legal liability. although our license agreements typically contain provisions that eliminate or limit our exposure to liability, there is no assurance these provisions will withstand legal challenge. there are limited suppliers for certain device and datacenter components. our competitors use some of the same suppliers and their demand for hardware components can affect the capacity available to us. if components are delayed or become unavailable, whether because of supplier capacity constraint, industry shortages, legal or regulatory changes that restrict supply sources, or other reasons, we may not obtain timely replacement supplies, resulting in reduced sales or inadequate datacenter capacity. component shortages, excess or obsolete inventory, or price reductions resulting in inventory adjustments may increase our cost of revenue. xbox consoles, surface devices, datacenter servers, and other hardware are assembled in asia and other geographies that may be subject to disruptions in the supply chain, resulting in shortages that would affect our revenue and operating margins.   legal, regulatory, and litigation risks government litigation and regulatory activity relating to competition rules may limit how we design and market our products.\u00a0as a leading global software and device maker, government agencies closely scrutinize us under u.s. and foreign competition laws. governments are actively enforcing competition laws and regulations, and this includes scrutiny in potentially large markets such as the eu, the u.s., and china. some jurisdictions also allow competitors or consumers to assert claims of anti-competitive conduct. u.s. federal and state antitrust authorities have previously brought enforcement actions and continue to scrutinize our business.  the european commission (\u201cthe commission\u201d) closely scrutinizes the design of high-volume microsoft products and the terms on which we make certain technologies used in these products, such as file formats, programming interfaces, and protocols, available to other companies. flagship product releases such as windows can receive significant scrutiny under competition laws. for example, in 2004, the commission ordered us to create new versions of our windows operating system that do not include certain multimedia technologies and to provide our competitors with specifications for how to implement certain proprietary windows communications protocols in their own products. in 2009, the commission accepted a set of commitments we offered to address the commission\u2019s concerns relating to competition in web browsing software, including an undertaking to address commission concerns relating to interoperability. the web browsing commitments expired in 2014. the remaining obligations may limit our ability to innovate in windows or other products in the future, diminish the developer appeal of the windows platform, and increase our product development costs. the availability of licenses related to protocols and file formats may enable competitors to develop software products that better mimic the functionality of our products, which could hamper sales of our\u00a0products.  our portfolio of first-party devices continues to grow; at the same time our oem partners offer a large variety of devices for our platforms. as a result, increasingly we both cooperate and compete with our oem partners, creating a risk that we fail to do so in compliance with competition rules. regulatory scrutiny in this area may increase. certain foreign governments, particularly in china and other countries in asia, have advanced arguments under their competition laws that exert downward pressure on royalties for our intellectual property.  30part i item 1a \u00a0 government regulatory actions and court decisions such as these may result in fines or hinder our ability to provide the benefits of our software to consumers and businesses, reducing the attractiveness of our products and the revenue that comes from them. new competition law actions could be initiated, potentially using previous actions as precedent. the outcome of such actions, or steps taken to avoid them, could adversely affect us in a variety of ways, including:            our global operations subject us to potential consequences under anti-corruption, trade, and other laws and regulations.\u00a0the foreign corrupt practices act (\u201cfcpa\u201d) and other anti-corruption laws and regulations (\u201canti-corruption laws\u201d) prohibit corrupt payments by our employees, vendors, or agents, and the accounting provisions of the fcpa require us to maintain accurate books and records and adequate internal controls. from time to time, we receive inquiries from authorities in the u.s. and elsewhere which may be based on reports from employees and others about our business activities outside the u.s. and our compliance with anti-corruption laws. periodically, we receive such reports directly and investigate them, and also cooperate with investigations by u.s. and foreign law enforcement authorities. an example of increasing international regulatory complexity is the eu whistleblower directive, initiated in 2021, which may present compliance challenges to the extent it is implemented in different forms by eu member states. most countries in which we operate also have competition laws that prohibit competitors from colluding or otherwise attempting to reduce competition between themselves. while we devote substantial resources to our u.s. and international compliance programs and have implemented policies, training, and internal controls designed to reduce the risk of corrupt payments and collusive activity, our employees, vendors, or agents may violate our policies. our failure to comply with anti-corruption laws or competition laws could result in significant fines and penalties, criminal sanctions against us, our officers, or our employees, prohibitions on the conduct of our business, and damage to our reputation.  increasing trade laws, policies, sanctions, and other regulatory requirements also affect our operations in and outside the u.s. relating to trade and investment. economic sanctions in the u.s., the eu, and other countries prohibit most business with restricted entities or countries such as crimea, cuba, iran, north korea, and syria. u.s. export controls restrict microsoft from offering many of its products and services to, or making investments in, certain entities in specified countries. u.s. import controls restrict us from integrating certain information and communication technologies into our supply chain and allow for government review of transactions involving information and communications technology from countries determined to be foreign adversaries. periods of intense diplomatic or armed conflict, such as the ongoing conflict in ukraine, may result in (1) new and rapidly evolving sanctions and trade restrictions, which may impair trade with sanctioned individuals and countries, and (2) negative impacts to regional trade ecosystems among our customers, partners, and us. non-compliance with sanctions as well as general ecosystem disruptions could result in reputational harm, operational delays, monetary fines, loss of revenues, increased costs, loss of export privileges, or criminal sanctions. 31part i item 1a \u00a0 other regulatory areas that may apply to our products and online services offerings include requirements related to user privacy, telecommunications, data storage and protection, advertising, and online content. for example, some regulators are taking the position that our offerings such as microsoft teams and skype are covered by existing laws regulating telecommunications services, and some new laws, including eu member state laws under the european electronic communications code, are defining more of our services as regulated telecommunications services. this trend may continue and will result in these offerings being subjected to additional data protection, security, and law enforcement surveillance obligations. regulators may assert that our collection, use, and management of customer data and other information is inconsistent with their laws and regulations, including laws that apply to the tracking of users via technology such as cookies. legislative or regulatory action relating to cybersecurity requirements may increase the costs to develop, implement, or secure our products and services. legislative and regulatory action is emerging in the areas of ai and content moderation, which could increase costs or restrict opportunity. applying these laws and regulations to our business is often unclear, subject to change over time, and sometimes may conflict from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. additionally, these laws and governments\u2019 approach to their enforcement, and our products and services, are continuing to evolve. compliance with these types of regulation may involve significant costs or require changes in products or business practices that result in reduced revenue. noncompliance could result in the imposition of penalties or orders we stop the alleged noncompliant activity.  we strive to empower all people and organizations to achieve more, and accessibility of our products is an important aspect of this goal. there is increasing pressure from advocacy groups, regulators, competitors, customers, and other stakeholders to make technology more accessible. if our products do not meet customer expectations or global accessibility requirements, we could lose sales opportunities or face regulatory or legal actions. laws and regulations relating to the handling of personal data may impede the adoption of our services or result in increased costs, legal claims, fines against us, or reputational damage.\u00a0the growth of our internet- and cloud-based services internationally relies increasingly on the movement of data across national boundaries. legal requirements relating to the collection, storage, handling, and transfer of personal data continue to evolve. for example, in july 2020 the court of justice of the eu invalidated a framework called privacy shield for companies to transfer data from eu member states to the united states. this ruling continues to generate uncertainty about the legal requirements for data transfers from the eu under other legal mechanisms and has resulted in some eu data protection authorities blocking the use of u.s.-based services that involve the transfer of data to the u.s. the u.s. and the eu in march 2022 agreed in principle on a replacement framework for the privacy shield, called the trans-atlantic data privacy framework. a failure of the u.s. and eu to finalize the trans-atlantic data privacy framework could compound that uncertainty and result in additional blockages of data transfers. potential new rules and restrictions on the flow of data across borders could increase the cost and complexity of delivering our products and services in some markets. for example, the eu general data protection regulation (\u201cgdpr\u201d) applies to all of our activities conducted from an establishment in the eu or related to products and services offered in the eu, imposes a range of compliance obligations regarding the handling of personal data. more recently, the eu has been developing new requirements related to the use of data, including in the digital markets act, the digital services act, and the data act, that will add additional rules and restriction on the use of data in our products and services. engineering efforts to build and maintain capabilities to facilitate compliance with these laws involve substantial expense and the diversion of engineering resources from other projects. we might experience reduced demand for our offerings if we are unable to engineer products that meet our legal duties or help our customers meet their obligations under the gdpr and other data regulations, or if our implementation to comply with the gdpr makes our offerings less attractive. compliance with these obligations depends in part on how particular regulators interpret and apply them. if we fail to comply, or if regulators assert we have failed to comply (including in response to complaints made by customers), it may lead to regulatory enforcement actions, which can result in monetary penalties (of up to 4% of worldwide revenue in the case of gdpr), private lawsuits, reputational damage, blockage of international data transfers, and loss of customers. the highest fines assessed under gdpr have recently been increasing, especially against large technology companies. jurisdictions around the world, such as china, india, and states in the u.s. have adopted, or are considering adopting or expanding, laws and regulations imposing obligations regarding the handling or transfer of personal data. 32part i item 1a \u00a0 the company\u2019s investment in gaining insights from data is becoming central to the value of the services we deliver to customers, to our operational efficiency and key opportunities in monetization, customer perceptions of quality, and operational efficiency. our ability to use data in this way may be constrained by regulatory developments that impede realizing the expected return from this investment. ongoing legal analyses, reviews, and inquiries by regulators of microsoft practices, or relevant practices of other organizations, may result in burdensome or inconsistent requirements, including data sovereignty and localization requirements, affecting the location, movement, collection, and use of our customer and internal employee data as well as the management of that data. compliance with applicable laws and regulations regarding personal data may require changes in services, business practices, or internal systems that result in increased costs, lower revenue, reduced efficiency, or greater difficulty in competing with foreign-based firms. compliance with data regulations might limit our ability to innovate or offer certain features and functionality in some jurisdictions where we operate. failure to comply with existing or new rules may result in significant penalties or orders to stop the alleged noncompliant activity, as well as negative publicity and diversion of management time and effort.  we have claims and lawsuits against us that may result in adverse outcomes.\u00a0we are subject to a variety of claims and lawsuits. these claims may arise from a wide variety of business practices and initiatives, including major new product releases such as windows, significant business transactions, warranty or product claims, and employment practices. adverse outcomes in some or all of these claims may result in significant monetary damages or injunctive relief that could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business. the litigation and other claims are subject to inherent uncertainties and management\u2019s view of these matters may change in the future. a material adverse impact in our consolidated financial statements could occur for the period in which the effect of an unfavorable outcome becomes probable and reasonably estimable.  our business with government customers may present additional uncertainties. we derive substantial revenue from government contracts. government contracts generally can present risks and challenges not present in private commercial agreements. for instance, we may be subject to government audits and investigations relating to these contracts, we could be suspended or debarred as a governmental contractor, we could incur civil and criminal fines and penalties, and under certain circumstances contracts may be rescinded. some agreements may allow a government to terminate without cause and provide for higher liability limits for certain losses.\u00a0some contracts may be subject to periodic funding approval, reductions, or delays which could adversely impact public-sector demand for our products and services. these events could negatively impact our results of operations, financial condition, and reputation.  we may have additional tax liabilities.\u00a0we are subject to income taxes in the u.s. and many foreign jurisdictions. significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes. in the course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. for example, compliance with the 2017 united states tax cuts and jobs act (\u201ctcja\u201d) and possible future legislative changes may require the collection of information not regularly produced within the company, the use of estimates in our consolidated financial statements, and the exercise of significant judgment in accounting for its provisions. as regulations and guidance evolve with respect to the tcja or possible future legislative changes, and as we gather more information and perform more analysis, our results may differ from previous estimates and may materially affect our consolidated financial statements. we regularly are under audit by tax authorities in different jurisdictions. although we believe that our provision for income taxes and our tax estimates are reasonable, tax authorities may disagree with certain positions we have taken. in addition, economic\u00a0and political\u00a0pressures to increase tax revenue in various jurisdictions may make resolving tax disputes favorably more difficult. we are currently under internal revenue service audit for prior tax years, with the primary unresolved issues relating to transfer pricing. the final resolution of those audits, and other audits or litigation, may differ from the amounts recorded in our consolidated financial statements and may materially affect our consolidated financial statements in the period or periods in which that determination is made.  we earn a significant amount of our operating income outside the u.s. a change in the mix of earnings and losses in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in our business or structure, or the expiration of or disputes about certain tax agreements in a particular country may result in higher effective tax rates for the company. in addition, changes in u.s. federal and state or international tax laws applicable to corporate multinationals, other fundamental law changes currently being considered by many countries, including in the u.s., and changes in taxing jurisdictions\u2019 administrative interpretations, decisions, policies, and positions may materially adversely impact our consolidated financial statements.  33part i item 1a \u00a0 intellectual property risks we may not be able to protect our source code from copying if there is an unauthorized disclosure.\u00a0source code, the detailed program commands for our operating systems and other software programs, is critical to our business. although we license portions of our application and operating system source code to several licensees, we take significant measures to protect the secrecy of large portions of our source code. if our source code leaks, we might lose future trade secret protection for that code. it may then become easier for third parties to compete with our products by copying functionality, which could adversely affect our revenue and operating margins. unauthorized disclosure of source code also could increase the security risks described elsewhere in these risk factors. legal changes, our evolving business model, piracy, and other factors may decrease the value of our intellectual property. protecting our intellectual property rights and combating unlicensed copying and use of our software and other intellectual property on a global basis is difficult. while piracy adversely affects u.s. revenue, the impact on revenue from outside the u.s. is more significant, particularly countries in which the legal system provides less protection for intellectual property rights. our revenue in these markets may grow more slowly than the underlying device market. similarly, the absence of harmonized patent laws makes it more difficult to ensure consistent respect for patent rights. throughout the world, we educate users about the benefits of licensing genuine products and obtaining indemnification benefits for intellectual property risks, and we educate lawmakers about the advantages of a business climate where intellectual property rights are protected. reductions in the legal protection for software intellectual property rights could adversely affect revenue.  we expend significant resources to patent the intellectual property we create with the expectation that we will generate revenues by incorporating that intellectual property in our products or services or, in some instances, by licensing or cross-licensing our patents to others in return for a royalty and/or increased freedom to operate.\u00a0changes in the law may continue to weaken our ability to prevent the use of patented technology or collect revenue for licensing our patents.\u00a0these include legislative changes and regulatory actions that make it more difficult to obtain injunctions, and the increasing use of legal process to challenge issued patents. similarly, licensees of our patents may fail to satisfy their obligations to pay us royalties or may contest the scope and extent of their obligations. the royalties we can obtain to monetize our intellectual property may decline because of the evolution of technology, price changes in products using licensed patents, greater value from cross-licensing, or the difficulty of discovering infringements. finally, our increasing engagement with open source software will also cause us to license our intellectual property rights broadly in certain situations and may negatively impact revenue. third parties may claim we infringe their intellectual property rights.\u00a0from time to time, others claim we infringe their intellectual property rights. the number of these claims may grow because of constant technological change in the markets in which we compete, the extensive patent coverage of existing technologies, the rapid rate of issuance of new patents, and our offering of first-party devices, such as surface. to resolve these claims, we may enter into royalty and licensing agreements on terms that are less favorable than currently available, stop selling or redesign affected products or services, or pay damages to satisfy indemnification commitments with our customers. these outcomes may cause operating margins to decline. besides money damages, in some jurisdictions plaintiffs can seek injunctive relief that may limit or prevent importing, marketing, and selling our products or services that have infringing technologies. in some countries, such as germany, an injunction can be issued before the parties have fully litigated the validity of the underlying patents. we have paid significant amounts to settle claims related to the use of technology and intellectual property rights and to procure intellectual property rights as part of our strategy to manage this risk, and may continue to do so.  general risks if our reputation or our brands are damaged, our business and operating results may be harmed. our reputation and brands are globally recognized and are important to our business. our reputation and brands affect our ability to attract and retain consumer, business, and public-sector customers. there are numerous ways our reputation or brands could be damaged. these include product safety or quality issues, our environmental impact and sustainability, supply chain practices, or human rights record. we may experience backlash from customers, government entities, advocacy groups, employees, and other stakeholders that disagree with our product offering decisions or public policy positions. damage to our reputation or our brands may occur from, among other things:    34part i item 1a \u00a0     the proliferation of social media may increase the likelihood, speed, and magnitude of negative brand events. if our brands or reputation are damaged, it could negatively impact our revenues or margins, or ability to attract the most highly qualified employees. adverse economic or market conditions may harm our business.\u00a0worsening economic conditions, including inflation, recession, pandemic, or other changes in economic conditions, may cause lower it spending and adversely affect our revenue. if demand for pcs, servers, and other computing devices declines, or consumer or business spending for those products declines, our revenue will be adversely affected.  our product distribution system relies on an extensive partner and retail network. oems building devices that run our software have also been a significant means of distribution. the impact of economic conditions on our partners, such as the bankruptcy of a major distributor, oem, or retailer, could cause sales channel disruption.  challenging economic conditions also may impair the ability of our customers to pay for products and services they have purchased. as a result, allowances for doubtful accounts and write-offs of accounts receivable may increase.  we maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings, types, and maturities. these investments are subject to general credit, liquidity, market, and interest rate risks, which may be exacerbated by market downturns or events that affect global financial markets. a significant part of our investment portfolio comprises u.s. government securities. if global financial markets decline for long periods, or if there is a downgrade of the u.s. government credit rating due to an actual or threatened default on government debt, our investment portfolio may be adversely affected and we could determine that more of our investments have experienced a decline in fair value, requiring impairment charges that could adversely affect our consolidated financial statements. catastrophic events or geopolitical conditions may disrupt our business.\u00a0a disruption or failure of our systems or operations because of a major earthquake, weather event, cyberattack, terrorist attack, pandemic, or other catastrophic event could cause delays in completing sales, providing services, or performing other critical functions. our corporate headquarters, a significant portion of our research and development activities, and certain other essential business operations are in the seattle, washington area, and we have other business operations in the silicon valley area of california, both of which are seismically active regions. a catastrophic event that results in the destruction or disruption of any of our critical business or it systems, or the infrastructure or systems they rely on, such as power grids, could harm our ability to conduct normal business operations. providing our customers with more services and solutions in the cloud puts a premium on the resilience of our systems and strength of our business continuity management plans and magnifies the potential impact of prolonged service outages in our consolidated financial statements.  abrupt political change, terrorist activity, and armed conflict, such as the ongoing conflict in ukraine, pose a risk of general economic disruption in affected countries, which may increase our operating costs and negatively impact our ability to sell to and collect from customers in affected markets. these conditions also may add uncertainty to the timing and budget for technology investment decisions by our customers and may cause supply chain disruptions for hardware manufacturers. geopolitical change may result in changing regulatory systems and requirements and market interventions that could impact our operating strategies, access to national, regional, and global markets, hiring, and profitability. geopolitical instability may lead to sanctions and impact our ability to do business in some markets or with some public-sector customers. any of these changes may negatively impact our revenues.  the occurrence of regional epidemics or a global pandemic such as covid-19 may adversely affect our operations, financial condition, and results of operations. the covid-19 pandemic has had widespread, rapidly evolving, and unpredictable impacts on global society, economies, financial markets, and business practices. the extent to which global pandemics impact our business going forward will depend on factors such as the duration and scope of the pandemic; governmental, business, and individuals' actions in response to the pandemic; and the impact on economic activity including the possibility of recession or financial market instability.  35part i item 1a \u00a0 measures to contain a global pandemic may intensify other risks described in these risk factors. any of these measures may adversely impact our ability to:             we may incur increased costs to effectively manage these aspects of our business. if we are unsuccessful it may adversely impact our revenues, cash flows, market share growth, and reputation. the long-term effects of climate change on the global economy and the it industry in particular are unclear. environmental regulations or changes in the supply, demand or available sources of energy or other resources may affect the availability or cost of goods and services, including natural resources, necessary to run our business. changes in climate where we operate may increase the costs of powering and cooling computer hardware we use to develop software and provide cloud-based services. our global business exposes us to operational and economic risks.\u00a0our customers are located throughout the world and a significant part of our revenue comes from international sales. the global nature of our business creates operational, economic, and geopolitical risks. our results of operations may be affected by global, regional, and local economic developments, monetary policy, inflation, and recession, as well as political and military disputes. in addition, our international growth strategy includes certain markets, the developing nature of which presents several risks, including deterioration of social, political, labor, or economic conditions in a country or region, and difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations. emerging nationalist and protectionist trends and concerns about human rights and political expression in specific countries may significantly alter the trade and commercial environments. changes to trade policy or agreements as a result of populism, protectionism, or economic nationalism may result in higher tariffs, local sourcing initiatives, and non-local sourcing restrictions, export controls, investment restrictions, or other developments that make it more difficult to sell our products in foreign countries. disruptions of these kinds in developed or emerging markets could negatively impact demand for our products and services or increase operating costs. although we hedge a portion of our international currency exposure, significant fluctuations in foreign exchange rates between the u.s. dollar and foreign currencies may adversely affect our results of operations.  our business depends on our ability to attract and retain talented employees.\u00a0our business is based on successfully attracting and retaining talented employees representing diverse backgrounds, experiences, and skill sets. the market for highly skilled workers and leaders in our industry is extremely competitive. maintaining our brand and reputation, as well as a diverse and inclusive work environment that enables all our employees to thrive, are important to our ability to recruit and retain employees. we are also limited in our ability to recruit internationally by restrictive domestic immigration laws. changes to u.s. immigration policies that restrain the flow of technical and professional talent may inhibit our ability to adequately staff our research and development efforts. if we are less successful in our recruiting efforts, or if we cannot retain highly skilled workers and key leaders, our ability to develop and deliver successful products and services may be adversely affected. effective succession planning is also important to our long-term success. failure to ensure effective transfer of knowledge and smooth transitions involving key employees could hinder our strategic planning and execution. how employment-related laws are interpreted and applied to our workforce practices may result in increased operating costs and less flexibility in how we meet our workforce needs. our global workforce is primarily non-unionized, but we have several unions and works councils outside of the united states. in the u.s., there has been a general increase in workers exercising their right to form or join a union. while microsoft has not received such petitions in the u.s., the unionization of significant employee populations could result in higher costs and other operational changes necessary to respond to changing conditions and to establish new relationships with worker representatives. \u00a0 \u00a0 36part ii item 7 \u00a0 economic conditions, challenges, and risks the markets for software, devices, and cloud-based services are dynamic and highly competitive. our competitors are developing new software and devices, while also deploying competing cloud-based services for consumers and businesses. the devices and form factors customers prefer evolve rapidly, and influence how users access services in the cloud, and in some cases, the user\u2019s choice of which suite of cloud-based services to use. we must continue to evolve and adapt over an extended time in pace with this changing environment. the investments we are making in infrastructure and devices will continue to increase our operating costs and may decrease our operating margins. our success is highly dependent on our ability to attract and retain qualified employees. we hire a mix of university and industry talent worldwide. we compete for talented individuals globally by offering an exceptional working environment, broad customer reach, scale in resources, the ability to grow one\u2019s career across many different products and businesses, and competitive compensation and benefits. aggregate demand for our software, services, and devices is correlated to global macroeconomic and geopolitical factors, which remain dynamic. our devices are primarily manufactured by third-party contract manufacturers, some of which contain certain components for which there are very few qualified suppliers. for these components, we have limited near-term flexibility to use other manufacturers if a current vendor becomes unavailable or is unable to meet our requirements. extended disruptions at these suppliers and/or manufacturers could lead to a similar disruption in our ability to manufacture devices on time to meet consumer demand. our international operations provide a significant portion of our total revenue and expenses. many of these revenue and expenses are denominated in currencies other than the u.s. dollar. as a result, changes in foreign exchange rates may significantly affect revenue and expenses. fluctuations in the u.s. dollar relative to certain foreign currencies did not have a material impact on reported revenue or expenses from our international operations in fiscal year 2022. refer to risk factors (part i, item\u00a01a of this form 10-k) for a discussion of these factors and other risks. seasonality our revenue fluctuates quarterly and is generally higher in the second and fourth quarters of our fiscal year. second quarter revenue is driven by corporate year-end spending trends in our major markets and holiday season spending by consumers, and fourth quarter revenue is driven by the volume of multi-year on-premises contracts executed during the period. reportable segments we report our financial performance based on the following segments: productivity and business processes, intelligent cloud, and more personal computing. the segment amounts included in md&a are presented on a basis consistent with our internal management reporting. additional information on our reportable segments is contained in note 19 \u2013 segment information and geographic data of the notes to financial statements (part ii, item\u00a08 of this form 10-k).  metrics we use metrics in assessing the performance of our business and to make informed decisions regarding the allocation of resources. we disclose metrics to enable investors to evaluate progress against our ambitions, provide transparency into performance trends, and reflect the continued evolution of our products and services. our commercial and other business metrics are fundamentally connected based on how customers use our products and services. the metrics are disclosed in the md&a or the notes to financial statements (part ii, item\u00a08 of this form 10-k). financial metrics are calculated based on financial results prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america (\u201cgaap\u201d), and growth comparisons relate to the corresponding period of last fiscal year. in the first quarter of fiscal year 2022, we made updates to the presentation and method of calculation for certain metrics, most notably changes to incorporate all current and anticipated revenue streams within our office consumer and server products and cloud services metrics and changes to align with how we manage our windows oem and search and news advertising businesses. none of these changes had a material impact on previously reported amounts in our md&a. 41part ii item 7 \u00a0 in the third quarter of fiscal year 2022, we completed our acquisition of nuance. nuance is included in all commercial metrics and our server products and cloud services revenue growth metric. azure and other cloud services revenue includes nuance cloud services, and server products revenue includes nuance on-premises offerings. commercial our commercial business primarily consists of server products and cloud services, office commercial, windows commercial, the commercial portion of linkedin, enterprise services, and dynamics. our commercial metrics allow management and investors to assess the overall health of our commercial business and include leading indicators of future performance. \u00a0   productivity and business processes and intelligent cloud metrics related to our productivity and business processes and intelligent cloud segments assess the health of our core businesses within these segments. the metrics reflect our cloud and on-premises product strategies and trends. \u00a0   42part ii item 7 \u00a0 \u00a0 more personal computing metrics related to our more personal computing segment assess the performance of key lines of business within this segment. these metrics provide strategic product insights which allow us to assess the performance across our commercial and consumer businesses. as we have diversity of target audiences and sales motions within the windows business, we monitor metrics that are reflective of those varying motions. \u00a0   summary results of operations \u00a0   \u00a0 adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share (\u201ceps\u201d) are non-gaap financial measures which exclude the net\u00a0income tax benefit related to transfer of intangible properties in the first quarter of fiscal year 2022 and the net income tax benefit related to an india supreme court decision on withholding taxes in the third quarter of fiscal year 2021. refer to the non-gaap financial measures section below for a reconciliation of our financial results reported in accordance with gaap to non-gaap financial results. see note 12 \u2013 income taxes of the notes to financial statements (part ii, item 8 of this form 10-k) for further discussion. fiscal year 2022 compared with fiscal year 2021 revenue increased $30.2 billion or 18% driven by growth across each of our segments. intelligent cloud revenue increased driven by azure and other cloud services. productivity and business processes revenue increased driven by office 365 commercial and linkedin. more personal computing revenue increased driven by search and news advertising and windows.  cost of revenue increased $10.4 billion or 20% driven by growth in microsoft cloud. gross margin increased $19.8 billion or 17% driven by growth across each of our segments.      43part ii item 7 \u00a0 operating expenses increased $6.3 billion or 14% driven by investments in cloud engineering, linkedin, gaming, and commercial sales. key changes in operating expenses were:       operating income increased $13.5 billion or 19% driven by growth across each of our segments. current year net income and diluted eps were positively impacted by the net tax benefit related to the transfer of intangible properties, which resulted in an increase to net income and diluted eps of $3.3 billion and $0.44, respectively. prior year net income and diluted eps were positively impacted by the net tax benefit related to the india supreme court decision on withholding taxes, which resulted in an increase to net income and diluted eps of $620 million and $0.08, respectively. gross margin and operating income both included an unfavorable foreign currency impact of 2%. segment results of operations \u00a0   reportable segments fiscal year 2022 compared with fiscal year 2021  productivity and business processes  revenue increased $9.4 billion or 18%.          44part ii item 7 \u00a0 \u00a0 operating income increased $5.3 billion or 22%.     gross margin and operating income both included an unfavorable foreign currency impact of 2%. intelligent cloud  revenue increased $15.2 billion or 25%.      operating income increased $6.6 billion or 25%.      revenue and operating income included an unfavorable foreign currency impact of 2% and 3%, respectively. more personal computing  revenue increased $5.6 billion or 10%.          operating income increased $1.5 billion or 8%.     45part ii item 7 \u00a0 operating expenses research and development \u00a0   \u00a0 research and development expenses include payroll, employee benefits, stock-based compensation expense, and other headcount-related expenses associated with product development. research and development expenses also include third-party development and programming costs, localization costs incurred to translate software for international markets, and the amortization of purchased software code and services content.  research and development expenses increased $3.8 billion or 18% driven by investments in cloud engineering, gaming, and linkedin. sales and marketing \u00a0   \u00a0 sales and marketing expenses include payroll, employee benefits, stock-based compensation expense, and other headcount-related expenses associated with sales and marketing personnel, and the costs of advertising, promotions, trade shows, seminars, and other programs.  sales and marketing expenses increased $1.7 billion or 8% driven by investments in commercial sales and linkedin. sales and marketing included a favorable foreign currency impact of 2%. general and administrative \u00a0   \u00a0 general and administrative expenses include payroll, employee benefits, stock-based compensation expense, and other headcount-related expenses associated with finance, legal, facilities, certain human resources and other administrative personnel, certain taxes, and legal and other administrative fees. general and administrative expenses increased $793 million or 16% driven by investments in corporate functions. 46part ii item 7 \u00a0 other income (expense), net  the components of other income (expense), net were as follows:  \u00a0   we use derivative instruments to manage risks related to foreign currencies, equity prices, interest rates, and credit; enhance investment returns; and facilitate portfolio diversification. gains and losses from changes in fair values of derivatives that are not designated as hedging instruments are primarily recognized in other income (expense), net.  interest and dividends income decreased due to lower portfolio balances. interest expense decreased due to a decrease in outstanding long-term debt due to debt maturities. net recognized gains on investments decreased primarily due to lower gains on equity securities.  income taxes  effective tax rate our effective tax rate for fiscal years 2022 and 2021 was 13% and 14%, respectively.\u00a0the decrease in our effective tax rate was primarily due to a $3.3 billion net income tax benefit in the first quarter of fiscal year 2022 related to the transfer of intangible properties, offset in part by changes in the mix of our income before income taxes between the u.s. and foreign countries, as well as tax benefits in the prior year from the india supreme court decision on withholding taxes in the case of engineering analysis centre of excellent private limited vs the commissioner of income tax, an agreement between the u.s. and india tax authorities related to transfer pricing, and final tax cuts and jobs act (\u201ctcja\u201d) regulations. in the first quarter of fiscal year 2022, we transferred certain intangible properties from our puerto rico subsidiary to the u.s. the transfer of intangible properties resulted in a $3.3 billion net income tax benefit in the first quarter of fiscal year 2022, as the value of future u.s. tax deductions exceeds the current tax liability from the u.s. global intangible low-taxed income tax. we have historically paid india withholding taxes on software sales through distributor withholding and tax audit assessments in india. in march 2021, the india supreme court ruled favorably for companies in 86 separate appeals, some dating back to 2012, holding that software sales are not subject to india withholding taxes. although we were not a party to the appeals, our software sales in india were determined to be not subject to withholding taxes. therefore, we recorded a net income tax benefit of $620 million in the third quarter of fiscal year 2021 to reflect the results of the india supreme court decision impacting fiscal year 1996 through fiscal year 2016. our effective tax rate was lower than the u.s. federal statutory rate, primarily due to the net income tax benefit related to the transfer of intangible properties, earnings taxed at lower rates in foreign jurisdictions resulting from producing and distributing our products and services through our foreign regional operations center in ireland, and tax benefits relating to stock-based compensation.  the mix of income before income taxes between the u.s. and foreign countries impacted our effective tax rate as a result of the geographic distribution of, and customer demand for, our products and services. in fiscal year 2022, our u.s. income before income taxes was $47.8 billion and our foreign income before income taxes was $35.9 billion. in fiscal year 2021, our u.s. income before income taxes was $35.0 billion and our foreign income before income taxes was $36.1 billion. 47part ii item 7 \u00a0 uncertain tax positions we settled a portion of the internal revenue service (\u201cirs\u201d) audit for tax years 2004 to 2006 in fiscal year 2011. in february 2012, the irs withdrew its 2011 revenue agents report related to unresolved issues for tax years 2004 to 2006 and reopened the audit phase of the examination. we also settled a portion of the irs audit for tax years 2007 to 2009 in fiscal year 2016, and a portion of the irs audit for tax years 2010 to 2013 in fiscal year 2018. in the second quarter of fiscal year 2021, we settled an additional portion of the irs audits for tax years 2004 to 2013 and made a payment of $1.7 billion, including tax and interest. we remain under audit for tax years 2004 to 2017.  as of june 30, 2022, the primary unresolved issues for the irs audits relate to transfer pricing, which could have a material impact in our consolidated financial statements when the matters are resolved. we believe our allowances for income tax contingencies are adequate. we have not received a proposed assessment for the unresolved key transfer pricing issues and do not expect a final resolution of these issues in the next 12 months.\u00a0based on the information currently available, we do not anticipate a significant increase or decrease to our tax contingencies for these issues within the next 12 months. we are subject to income tax in many jurisdictions outside the u.s. our operations in certain jurisdictions remain subject to examination for tax years 1996 to 2021, some of which are currently under audit by local tax authorities. the resolution of each of these audits is not expected to be material to our consolidated financial statements. non-gaap financial measures adjusted net income and adjusted diluted eps are non-gaap financial measures which exclude the net\u00a0tax benefit related to the transfer of intangible properties in the first quarter of fiscal year 2022 and the net income tax benefit related to an india supreme court decision on withholding taxes in the third quarter of fiscal year 2021. we believe these non-gaap measures aid investors by providing additional insight into our operational performance and help clarify trends affecting our business. for comparability of reporting, management considers non-gaap measures in conjunction with gaap financial results in evaluating business performance. these non-gaap financial measures presented should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, the measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with gaap. the following table reconciles our financial results reported in accordance with gaap to non-gaap financial results: \u00a0   \u00a0   48part ii item 7 \u00a0 \u00a0 liquidity and capital resources we expect existing cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, cash flows from operations, and access to capital markets to continue to be sufficient to fund our operating activities and cash commitments for investing and financing activities, such as dividends, share repurchases, debt maturities, material capital expenditures, and the transition tax related to the tcja, for at least the next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future.  cash, cash equivalents, and investments  cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments totaled $104.8 billion and $130.3 billion as of june 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. equity investments were $6.9 billion and $6.0 billion as of june 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. our short-term investments are primarily intended to facilitate liquidity and capital preservation. they consist predominantly of highly liquid investment-grade fixed-income securities, diversified among industries and individual issuers. the investments are predominantly u.s. dollar-denominated securities, but also include foreign currency-denominated securities to diversify risk. our fixed-income investments are exposed to interest rate risk and credit risk. the credit risk and average maturity of our fixed-income portfolio are managed to achieve economic returns that correlate to certain fixed-income indices. the settlement risk related to these investments is insignificant given that the short-term investments held are primarily highly liquid investment-grade fixed-income securities.  valuation  in general, and where applicable, we use quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities to determine the fair value of our financial instruments. this pricing methodology applies to our level 1 investments, such as u.s. government securities, common and preferred stock, and mutual funds. if quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities are not available to determine fair value, then we use quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities or inputs other than the quoted prices that are observable either directly or indirectly. this pricing methodology applies to our level 2 investments, such as commercial paper, certificates of deposit, u.s. agency securities, foreign government bonds, mortgage- and asset-backed securities, corporate notes and bonds, and municipal securities. level 3 investments are valued using internally-developed models with unobservable inputs. assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis using unobservable inputs are an immaterial portion of our portfolio.  a majority of our investments are priced by pricing vendors and are generally level 1 or level 2 investments as these vendors either provide a quoted market price in an active market or use observable inputs for their pricing without applying significant adjustments. broker pricing is used mainly when a quoted price is not available, the investment is not priced by our pricing vendors, or when a broker price is more reflective of fair values in the market in which the investment trades. our broker-priced investments are generally classified as level 2 investments because the broker prices these investments based on similar assets without applying significant adjustments. in addition, all our broker-priced investments have a sufficient level of trading volume to demonstrate that the fair values used are appropriate for these investments. our fair value processes include controls that are designed to ensure appropriate fair values are recorded. these controls include model validation, review of key model inputs, analysis of period-over-period fluctuations, and independent recalculation of prices where appropriate.  cash flows  cash from operations increased $12.3 billion to $89.0 billion for fiscal year 2022, mainly due to an increase in cash received from customers, offset in part by an increase in cash paid to suppliers and employees. cash used in financing increased $10.4 billion to $58.9 billion for fiscal year 2022, mainly due to a $5.3 billion increase in common stock repurchases and a $5.3 billion increase in repayments of debt. cash used in investing increased $2.7 billion to $30.3 billion for fiscal year 2022, mainly due to a $13.1 billion increase in cash used for acquisitions of companies, net of cash acquired, and purchases of intangible and other assets, and a $3.3 billion increase in additions to property and equipment, offset in part by a $15.6 billion increase in cash from net investment purchases, sales, and maturities. 49part ii item 7 \u00a0 debt proceeds we issue debt to take advantage of favorable pricing and liquidity in the debt markets, reflecting our credit rating and the low interest rate environment. the proceeds of these issuances were or will be used for general corporate purposes, which may include, among other things, funding for working capital, capital expenditures, repurchases of capital stock, acquisitions, and repayment of existing debt. in march 2021 and june 2020, we exchanged a portion of our existing debt at a premium for cash and new debt with longer maturities to take advantage of favorable financing rates in the debt markets, reflecting our credit rating and the low interest rate environment. refer to note 11 \u2013 debt of the notes to financial statements (part ii, item\u00a08 of this form 10-k) for further discussion. unearned revenue  unearned revenue comprises mainly unearned revenue related to volume licensing programs, which may include software assurance (\u201csa\u201d) and cloud services. unearned revenue is generally invoiced annually at the beginning of each contract period for multi-year agreements and recognized ratably over the coverage period. unearned revenue also includes payments for other offerings for which we have been paid in advance and earn the revenue when we transfer control of the product or service. refer to note 1 \u2013 accounting policies of the notes to financial statements (part ii, item 8 of this form 10-k) for further discussion. the following table outlines the expected future recognition of unearned revenue as of june 30, 2022: \u00a0   \u00a0 if our customers choose to license cloud-based versions of our products and services rather than licensing transaction-based products and services, the associated revenue will shift from being recognized at the time of the transaction to being recognized over the subscription period or upon consumption, as applicable.  50part ii item 7 \u00a0 material cash requirements and other obligations contractual obligations the following table summarizes the payments due by fiscal year for our outstanding contractual obligations as of june 30, 2022: \u00a0   \u00a0         income taxes as a result of the tcja, we are required to pay a one-time transition tax on deferred foreign income not previously subject to u.s. income tax. under the tcja, the transition tax is payable in interest-free installments over eight years, with 8% due in each of the first five years, 15% in year six, 20% in year seven, and 25% in year eight. we have paid transition tax of $6.2 billion, which included $1.5 billion for fiscal year 2022. the remaining transition tax of $12.0 billion is payable over the next four years, with $1.3 billion payable within 12 months.  provisions enacted in the tcja related to the\u00a0capitalization\u00a0for tax purposes of\u00a0research\u00a0and experimental expenditures became effective on july 1, 2022. these provisions require us to capitalize research and experimental expenditures and amortize them on the u.s. tax return over five or fifteen years, depending on where research is conducted. the final foreign tax credit regulations, also effective on july 1, 2022, introduced significant changes to foreign tax credit calculations in the u.s. tax return. while these provisions are not expected to have a material impact on our fiscal year 2023 effective tax rate on a net basis, our cash paid for taxes would increase unless these provisions are postponed or modified through legislative processes. share repurchases  during fiscal years 2022 and 2021, we repurchased 95 million shares and 101 million shares of our common stock for $28.0 billion and $23.0 billion, respectively, through our share repurchase programs. all repurchases were made using cash resources. as of june 30, 2022, $40.7 billion remained of our $60 billion share repurchase program. refer to note 16 \u2013 stockholders\u2019 equity of the notes to financial statements (part ii, item\u00a08 of this form 10-k) for further discussion. dividends  during fiscal year 2022, our board of directors declared quarterly dividends of $0.62 per share. we intend to continue returning capital to shareholders in the form of dividends, subject to declaration by our board of directors. refer to note 16 \u2013 stockholders\u2019 equity of the notes to financial statements (part ii, item\u00a08 of this form 10-k) for further discussion. 51part ii item 7 \u00a0 other planned uses of capital  on january 18, 2022, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire activision blizzard, inc. (\u201cactivision blizzard\u201d) for $95.00 per share in an all-cash transaction valued at $68.7 billion, inclusive of activision blizzard\u2019s net cash. the acquisition has been approved by activision blizzard\u2019s shareholders, and we expect it to close in fiscal year 2023, subject to the satisfaction of certain regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions. we will continue to invest in sales, marketing, product support infrastructure, and existing and advanced areas of technology, as well as continue making acquisitions that align with our business strategy. additions to property and equipment will continue, including new facilities, datacenters, and computer systems for research and development, sales and marketing, support, and administrative staff. we expect capital expenditures to increase in coming years to support growth in our cloud offerings. we have operating and finance leases for datacenters, corporate offices, research and development facilities, microsoft experience centers, and certain equipment. we have not engaged in any related party transactions or arrangements with unconsolidated entities or other persons that are reasonably likely to materially affect liquidity or the availability of capital resources.  recent accounting guidance  refer to note 1 \u2013 accounting policies of the notes to financial statements (part ii, item\u00a08 of this form 10-k) for further discussion. critical accounting estimates  our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with gaap. preparing consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. critical accounting estimates are those estimates that involve a significant level of estimation uncertainty and could have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. we have critical accounting estimates in the areas of revenue recognition, impairment of investment securities, goodwill, research and development costs, legal and other contingencies, income taxes, and inventories.  revenue recognition  our contracts with customers often include promises to transfer multiple products and services to a customer. determining whether products and services are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately versus together may require significant judgment. when a cloud-based service includes both on-premises software licenses and cloud services, judgment is required to determine whether the software license is considered distinct and accounted for separately, or not distinct and accounted for together with the cloud service and recognized over time. certain cloud services, primarily office 365, depend on a significant level of integration, interdependency, and interrelation between the desktop applications and cloud services, and are accounted for together as one performance obligation. revenue from office 365 is recognized ratably over the period in which the cloud services are provided.  judgment is required to determine the stand-alone selling price (\u201cssp\") for each distinct performance obligation. we use a single amount to estimate ssp for items that are not sold separately, including on-premises licenses sold with sa or software updates provided at no additional charge. we use a range of amounts to estimate ssp when we sell each of the products and services separately and need to determine whether there is a discount to be allocated based on the relative ssp of the various products and services.  in instances where ssp is not directly observable, such as when we do not sell the product or service separately, we determine the ssp using information that may include market conditions and other observable inputs. we typically have more than one ssp for individual products and services due to the stratification of those products and services by customers and circumstances. in these instances, we may use information such as the size of the customer and geographic region in determining the ssp.  due to the various benefits from and the nature of our sa program, judgment is required to assess the pattern of delivery, including the exercise pattern of certain benefits across our portfolio of customers.  52part ii item 7 \u00a0 our products are generally sold with a right of return, we may provide other credits or incentives, and in certain instances we estimate customer usage of our products and services, which are accounted for as variable consideration when determining the amount of revenue to recognize. returns and credits are estimated at contract inception and updated at the end of each reporting period if additional information becomes available. changes to our estimated variable consideration were not material for the periods presented.  impairment of investment securities  we review debt investments quarterly for credit losses and impairment. if the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value, we evaluate, among other factors, general market conditions, credit quality of debt instrument issuers, and the extent to which the fair value is less than cost. this determination requires significant judgment. in making this judgment, we employ a systematic methodology that considers available quantitative and qualitative evidence in evaluating potential impairment of our investments. in addition, we consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of, and business outlook for, the investee. if we have plans to sell the security or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery, then a decline in fair value below cost is recorded as an impairment charge in other income (expense), net and a new cost basis in the investment is established. if market, industry, and/or investee conditions deteriorate, we may incur future impairments.  equity investments without readily determinable fair values are written down to fair value if a qualitative assessment indicates that the investment is impaired and the fair value of the investment is less than carrying value. we perform a qualitative assessment on a periodic basis. we are required to estimate the fair value of the investment to determine the amount of the impairment loss. once an investment is determined to be impaired, an impairment charge is recorded in other income (expense), net.  goodwill  we allocate goodwill to reporting units based on the reporting unit expected to benefit from the business combination. we evaluate our reporting units on an annual basis and, if necessary, reassign goodwill using a relative fair value allocation approach. goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level (operating segment or one level below an operating segment) on an annual basis (may 1 for us) and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. these events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate, legal factors, operating performance indicators, competition, or sale or disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit.  application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment, including the identification of reporting units, assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units, assignment of goodwill to reporting units, and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit. the fair value of each reporting unit is estimated primarily through the use of a discounted cash flow methodology. this analysis requires significant judgments, including estimation of future cash flows, which is dependent on internal forecasts, estimation of the long-term rate of growth for our business, estimation of the useful life over which cash flows will occur, and determination of our weighted average cost of capital.  the estimates used to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit change from year to year based on operating results, market conditions, and other factors. changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and goodwill impairment for each reporting unit.  research and development costs  costs incurred internally in researching and developing a computer software product are charged to expense until technological feasibility has been established for the product. once technological feasibility is established, software costs are capitalized until the product is available for general release to customers. judgment is required in determining when technological feasibility of a product is established. we have determined that technological feasibility for our software products is reached after all high-risk development issues have been resolved through coding and testing. generally, this occurs shortly before the products are released to production. the amortization of these costs is included in cost of revenue over the estimated life of the products.  53part ii item 7 \u00a0 legal and other contingencies  the outcomes of legal proceedings and claims brought against us are subject to significant uncertainty. an estimated loss from a loss contingency such as a legal proceeding or claim is accrued by a charge to income if it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. in determining whether a loss should be accrued we evaluate, among other factors, the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss. changes in these factors could materially impact our consolidated financial statements. income taxes  the objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year, and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entity\u2019s financial statements or tax returns. we recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. accounting literature also provides guidance on derecognition of income tax assets and liabilities, classification of deferred income tax assets and liabilities, accounting for interest and penalties associated with tax positions, and income tax disclosures. judgment is required in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements or tax returns. variations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could materially impact our consolidated financial statements.  inventories  inventories are stated at average cost, subject to the lower of cost or net realizable value. cost includes materials, labor, and manufacturing overhead related to the purchase and production of inventories. net realizable value is the estimated selling price less estimated costs of completion, disposal, and transportation. we regularly review inventory quantities on hand, future purchase commitments with our suppliers, and the estimated utility of our inventory. these reviews include analysis of demand forecasts, product life cycle status, product development plans, current sales levels, pricing strategy, and component cost trends. if our review indicates a reduction in utility below carrying value, we reduce our inventory to a new cost basis through a charge to cost of revenue. change in accounting estimate in july 2022, we completed an assessment of the useful lives of our server and network equipment. due to investments in software that increased efficiencies in how we operate our server and network equipment, as well as advances in technology, we determined we should increase the estimated useful lives of both server and network equipment from four years to six years. this change in accounting estimate will be effective beginning fiscal year 2023. based on the carrying amount of server and network equipment included in property and equipment, net as of june 30, 2022, it is estimated this change will increase our fiscal year 2023 operating income by $3.7 billion. we had previously increased the estimated useful lives of both server and network equipment in july 2020. \u00a0 54part ii item 7 \u00a0 \u00a0 statement of management\u2019s responsibility for financial statements  management is responsible for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements and related information that are presented in this report. the consolidated financial statements, which include amounts based on management\u2019s estimates and judgments, have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america.  the company designs and maintains accounting and internal control systems to provide reasonable assurance at reasonable cost that assets are safeguarded against loss from unauthorized use or disposition, and that the financial records are reliable for preparing consolidated financial statements and maintaining accountability for assets. these systems are augmented by written policies, an organizational structure providing division of responsibilities, careful selection and training of qualified personnel, and a program of internal audits.  the company engaged deloitte\u00a0& touche llp, an independent registered public accounting firm, to audit and render an opinion on the consolidated financial statements and internal control over financial reporting in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board (united states).  the board of directors, through its audit committee, consisting solely of independent directors of the company, meets periodically with management, internal auditors, and our independent registered public accounting firm to ensure that each is meeting its responsibilities and to discuss matters concerning internal controls and financial reporting. deloitte\u00a0& touche llp and the internal auditors each have full and free access to the audit committee.  \u00a0   \u00a0 55part ii item 7a \u00a0 \u00a0 item\u00a07a.\u00a0quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk risks  we are exposed to economic risk from foreign exchange rates, interest rates, credit risk, and equity prices. we use derivatives instruments to manage these risks, however, they may still impact our consolidated financial statements.  foreign currencies  certain forecasted transactions, assets, and liabilities are exposed to foreign currency risk. we monitor our foreign currency exposures daily to maximize the economic effectiveness of our foreign currency positions, including hedges. principal currency exposures include the euro, japanese yen, british pound, canadian dollar, and australian dollar.  interest rate  securities held in our fixed-income portfolio are subject to different interest rate risks based on their maturities. we manage the average maturity of the fixed-income portfolio to achieve economic returns that correlate to certain global fixed-income indices.  credit our fixed-income portfolio is diversified and consists primarily of investment-grade securities. we manage credit exposures relative to broad-based indices and to facilitate portfolio diversification.  equity  securities held in our equity investments portfolio are subject to price risk.  sensitivity analysis the following table sets forth the potential loss in future earnings or fair values, including associated derivatives, resulting from hypothetical changes in relevant market rates or prices:  \u00a0   \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 56part ii item 8 \u00a0 \u00a0 notes to financial statements  note 1 \u2014 accounting policies accounting principles  our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america (\u201cgaap\u201d). we have recast certain prior period amounts to conform to the current period presentation. the recast of these prior period amounts had no impact on our consolidated balance sheets, consolidated income statements, or consolidated cash flows statements.  principles of consolidation  the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of microsoft corporation and its subsidiaries. intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated.  estimates and assumptions  preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. examples of estimates and assumptions include: for revenue recognition, determining the nature and timing of satisfaction of performance obligations, and determining the standalone selling price (\u201cssp\u201d) of performance obligations, variable consideration, and other obligations such as product returns and refunds; loss contingencies; product warranties; the fair value of and/or potential impairment of goodwill and intangible assets for our reporting units; product life cycles; useful lives of our tangible and intangible assets; allowances for doubtful accounts; the market value of, and demand for, our inventory; stock-based compensation forfeiture rates; when technological feasibility is achieved for our products; the potential outcome of uncertain tax positions that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements or tax returns; and determining the timing and amount of impairments for investments. actual results and outcomes may differ from management\u2019s estimates and assumptions due to risks and uncertainties. in july 2022, we completed an assessment of the useful lives of our server and network equipment. due to investments in software that increased efficiencies in how we operate our server and network equipment, as well as advances in technology, we determined we should increase the estimated useful lives of both server and network equipment from four years to six years. this change in accounting estimate will be effective beginning fiscal year 2023. we had previously increased the estimated useful lives of both server and network equipment in july 2020. foreign currencies  assets and liabilities recorded in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rate on the balance sheet date. revenue and expenses are translated at average rates of exchange prevailing during the year. translation adjustments resulting from this process are recorded to other comprehensive income.  revenue\u00a0\u00a0 product revenue and service and other revenue  product revenue includes sales from operating systems, cross-device productivity applications, server applications, business solution applications, desktop and server management tools, software development tools, video games, and hardware such as pcs, tablets, gaming and entertainment consoles, other intelligent devices, and related accessories.  service and other revenue includes sales from cloud-based solutions that provide customers with software, services, platforms, and content such as office 365, azure, dynamics 365, and xbox; solution support; and consulting services. service and other revenue also includes sales from online advertising and linkedin. 62part ii item 8 \u00a0 revenue recognition revenue is recognized upon transfer of control of promised products or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those products or services. we enter into contracts that can include various combinations of products and services, which are generally capable of being distinct and accounted for as separate performance obligations. revenue is recognized net of allowances for returns and any taxes collected from customers, which are subsequently remitted to governmental authorities.  nature of products and services licenses for on-premises software provide the customer with a right to use the software as it exists when made available to the customer. customers may purchase perpetual licenses or subscribe to licenses, which provide customers with the same functionality and differ mainly in the duration over which the customer benefits from the software. revenue from distinct on-premises licenses is recognized upfront at the point in time when the software is made available to the customer. in cases where we allocate revenue to software updates, primarily because the updates are provided at no additional charge, revenue is recognized as the updates are provided, which is generally ratably over the estimated life of the related device or license. certain volume licensing programs, including enterprise agreements, include on-premises licenses combined with software assurance (\u201csa\u201d). sa conveys rights to new software and upgrades released over the contract period and provides support, tools, and training to help customers deploy and use products more efficiently. on-premises licenses are considered distinct performance obligations when sold with sa. revenue allocated to sa is generally recognized ratably over the contract period as customers simultaneously consume and receive benefits, given that sa comprises distinct performance obligations that are satisfied over time.  cloud services, which allow customers to use hosted software over the contract period without taking possession of the software, are provided on either a subscription or consumption basis. revenue related to cloud services provided on a subscription basis is recognized ratably over the contract period. revenue related to cloud services provided on a consumption basis, such as the amount of storage used in a period, is recognized based on the customer utilization of such resources. when cloud services require a significant level of integration and interdependency with software and the individual components are not considered distinct, all revenue is recognized over the period in which the cloud services are provided.  revenue from search advertising is recognized when the advertisement appears in the search results or when the action necessary to earn the revenue has been completed. revenue from consulting services is recognized as services are provided.  our hardware is generally highly dependent on, and interrelated with, the underlying operating system and cannot function without the operating system. in these cases, the hardware and software license are accounted for as a single performance obligation and revenue is recognized at the point in time when ownership is transferred to resellers or directly to end customers through retail stores and online marketplaces.  refer to note 19 \u2013 segment information and geographic data for further information, including revenue by significant product and service offering. significant judgments our contracts with customers often include promises to transfer multiple products and services to a customer. determining whether products and services are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately versus together may require significant judgment. when a cloud-based service includes both on-premises software licenses and cloud services, judgment is required to determine whether the software license is considered distinct and accounted for separately, or not distinct and accounted for together with the cloud service and recognized over time. certain cloud services, primarily office 365, depend on a significant level of integration, interdependency, and interrelation between the desktop applications and cloud services, and are accounted for together as one performance obligation. revenue from office 365 is recognized ratably over the period in which the cloud services are provided. 63part ii item 8 \u00a0 judgment is required to determine the ssp for each distinct performance obligation. we use a single amount to estimate ssp for items that are not sold separately, including on-premises licenses sold with sa or software updates provided at no additional charge. we use a range of amounts to estimate ssp when we sell each of the products and services separately and need to determine whether there is a discount to be allocated based on the relative ssp of the various products and services.  in instances where ssp is not directly observable, such as when we do not sell the product or service separately, we determine the ssp using information that may include market conditions and other observable inputs. we typically have more than one ssp for individual products and services due to the stratification of those products and services by customers and circumstances. in these instances, we may use information such as the size of the customer and geographic region in determining the ssp.  due to the various benefits from and the nature of our sa program, judgment is required to assess the pattern of delivery, including the exercise pattern of certain benefits across our portfolio of customers.  our products are generally sold with a right of return, we may provide other credits or incentives, and in certain instances we estimate customer usage of our products and services, which are accounted for as variable consideration when determining the amount of revenue to recognize. returns and credits are estimated at contract inception and updated at the end of each reporting period if additional information becomes available. changes to our estimated variable consideration were not material for the periods presented. contract balances and other receivables  timing of revenue recognition may differ from the timing of invoicing to customers. we record a receivable when revenue is recognized prior to invoicing, or unearned revenue when revenue is recognized subsequent to invoicing. for multi-year agreements, we generally invoice customers annually at the beginning of each annual coverage period. we record a receivable related to revenue recognized for multi-year on-premises licenses as we have an unconditional right to invoice and receive payment in the future related to those licenses.  unearned revenue comprises mainly unearned revenue related to volume licensing programs, which may include sa and cloud services. unearned revenue is generally invoiced annually at the beginning of each contract period for multi-year agreements and recognized ratably over the coverage period. unearned revenue also includes payments for consulting services to be performed in the future, linkedin subscriptions, office 365 subscriptions, xbox subscriptions, windows post-delivery support, dynamics business solutions, and other offerings for which we have been paid in advance and earn the revenue when we transfer control of the product or service.  refer to note 13 \u2013 unearned revenue for further information, including unearned revenue by segment and changes in unearned revenue during the period. payment terms and conditions vary by contract type, although terms generally include a requirement of payment within 30 to 60 days. in instances where the timing of revenue recognition differs from the timing of invoicing, we have determined our contracts generally do not include a significant financing component. the primary purpose of our invoicing terms is to provide customers with simplified and predictable ways of purchasing our products and services, not to receive financing from our customers or to provide customers with financing. examples include invoicing at the beginning of a subscription term with revenue recognized ratably over the contract period, and multi-year on-premises licenses that are invoiced annually with revenue recognized upfront. as of june 30, 2022 and 2021, other receivables due from suppliers were $1.0 billion and $965 million, respectively, and are included in accounts receivable, net in our consolidated balance sheets. as of june 30, 2022 and 2021, long-term accounts receivable, net of allowance for doubtful accounts, was $3.8 billion and $3.4 billion, respectively, and is included in other long-term assets in our consolidated balance sheets. the allowance for doubtful accounts reflects our best estimate of probable losses inherent in the accounts receivable balance. we determine the allowance based on known troubled accounts, historical experience, and other currently available evidence.  64part ii item 8 \u00a0 activity in the allowance for doubtful accounts was as follows:\u00a0 \u00a0   \u00a0 allowance for doubtful accounts included in our consolidated balance sheets: \u00a0   \u00a0 we record financing receivables when we offer certain of our customers the option to acquire our software products and services offerings through a financing program in a limited number of countries. as of june 30, 2022 and 2021, our financing receivables, net were $4.1 billion and $4.4 billion, respectively, for short-term and long-term financing receivables, which are included in other current assets and other long-term assets in our consolidated balance sheets. we record an allowance to cover expected losses based on troubled accounts, historical experience, and other currently available evidence. assets recognized from costs to obtain a contract with a customer we recognize an asset for the incremental costs of obtaining a contract with a customer if we expect the benefit of those costs to be longer than one year. we have determined that certain sales incentive programs meet the requirements to be capitalized. total capitalized costs to obtain a contract were immaterial during the periods presented and are included in other current and long-term assets in our consolidated balance sheets.  we apply a practical expedient to expense costs as incurred for costs to obtain a contract with a customer when the amortization period would have been one year or less. these costs include our internal sales force compensation program and certain partner sales incentive programs as we have determined annual compensation is commensurate with annual sales activities. cost of revenue  cost of revenue includes: manufacturing and distribution costs for products sold and programs licensed; operating costs related to product support service centers and product distribution centers; costs incurred to include software on pcs sold by original equipment manufacturers (\u201coem\u201d), to drive traffic to our websites, and to acquire online advertising space; costs incurred to support and maintain online products and services, including datacenter costs and royalties; warranty costs; inventory valuation adjustments; costs associated with the delivery of consulting services; and the amortization of capitalized software development costs. capitalized software development costs are amortized over the estimated lives of the products.  product warranty  we provide for the estimated costs of fulfilling our obligations under hardware and software warranties at the time the related revenue is recognized. for hardware warranties, we estimate the costs based on historical and projected product failure rates, historical and projected repair costs, and knowledge of specific product failures (if any). the specific hardware warranty terms and conditions vary depending upon the product sold and the country in which we do business, but generally include parts and labor over a period generally ranging from 90\u00a0days to three years. for software warranties, we estimate the costs to provide bug fixes, such as security patches, over the estimated life of the software. we regularly reevaluate our estimates to assess the adequacy of the recorded warranty liabilities and adjust the amounts as necessary.  65part ii item 8 \u00a0 research and development  research and development expenses include payroll, employee benefits, stock-based compensation expense, and other headcount-related expenses associated with product development. research and development expenses also include third-party development and programming costs, localization costs incurred to translate software for international markets, and the amortization of purchased software code and services content. such costs related to software development are included in research and development expense until the point that technological feasibility is reached, which for our software products, is generally shortly before the products are released to production. once technological feasibility is reached, such costs are capitalized and amortized to cost of revenue over the estimated lives of the products.  sales and marketing  sales and marketing expenses include payroll, employee benefits, stock-based compensation expense, and other headcount-related expenses associated with sales and marketing personnel, and the costs of advertising, promotions, trade shows, seminars, and other programs. advertising costs are expensed as incurred. advertising expense was $1.5 billion, $1.5 billion, and $1.6 billion in fiscal years 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively.  stock-based compensation  compensation cost for stock awards, which include restricted stock units (\u201crsus\u201d) and performance stock units (\u201cpsus\u201d), is measured at the fair value on the grant date and recognized as expense, net of estimated forfeitures, over the related service or performance period. the fair value of stock awards is based on the quoted price of our common stock on the grant date less the present value of expected dividends not received during the vesting period. we measure the fair value of psus using a monte carlo valuation model. compensation cost for rsus is recognized using the straight-line method and for psus is recognized using the accelerated method. compensation expense for the employee stock purchase plan (\u201cespp\u201d) is measured as the discount the employee is entitled to upon purchase and is recognized in the period of purchase. income taxes  income tax expense includes u.s. and international income taxes, and interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions. certain income and expenses are not reported in tax returns and financial statements in the same year. the tax effect of such temporary differences is reported as deferred income taxes. deferred tax assets are reported net of a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized. all deferred income taxes are classified as long-term in our consolidated balance sheets.  financial instruments investments we consider all highly liquid interest-earning investments with a maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase to be cash equivalents. the fair values of these investments approximate their carrying values. in general, investments with original maturities of greater than three months and remaining maturities of less than one year are classified as short-term investments. investments with maturities beyond one year may be classified as short-term based on their highly liquid nature and because such marketable securities represent the investment of cash that is available for current operations.  66part ii item 8 \u00a0 debt investments are classified as available-for-sale and realized gains and losses are recorded using the specific identification method. changes in fair value, excluding credit losses and impairments, are recorded in other comprehensive income. fair value is calculated based on publicly available market information or other estimates determined by management. if the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value, we evaluate, among other factors, general market conditions, credit quality of debt instrument issuers, and the extent to which the fair value is less than cost. to determine credit losses, we employ a systematic methodology that considers available quantitative and qualitative evidence. in addition, we consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of, and business outlook for, the investee. if we have plans to sell the security or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery, then a decline in fair value below cost is recorded as an impairment charge in other income (expense), net and a new cost basis in the investment is established. if market, industry, and/or investee conditions deteriorate, we may incur future impairments. equity investments with readily determinable fair values are measured at fair value. equity investments without readily determinable fair values are measured using the equity method or measured at cost with adjustments for observable changes in price or impairments (referred to as the measurement alternative). we perform a qualitative assessment on a periodic basis and recognize an impairment if there are sufficient indicators that the fair value of the investment is less than carrying value. changes in value are recorded in other income (expense), net.  derivatives derivative instruments are recognized as either assets or liabilities and measured at fair value. the accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation.  for derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges, gains and losses are recognized in other income (expense), net with offsetting gains and losses on the hedged items. gains and losses representing hedge components excluded from the assessment of effectiveness are recognized in other income (expense), net. for derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges, gains and losses are initially reported as a component of other comprehensive income and subsequently recognized in other income (expense), net with the corresponding hedged item. gains and losses representing hedge components excluded from the assessment of effectiveness are recognized in other income (expense), net.  for derivative instruments that are not designated as hedges, gains and losses from changes in fair values are primarily recognized in other income (expense), net. fair value measurements we account for certain assets and liabilities at fair value. the hierarchy below lists three levels of fair value based on the extent to which inputs used in measuring fair value are observable in the market.\u00a0we categorize each of our fair value measurements in one of these three levels based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. these levels are:      67part ii item 8 \u00a0   we measure equity investments without readily determinable fair values on a nonrecurring basis. the fair values of these investments are determined based on valuation techniques using the best information available, and may include quoted market prices, market comparables, and discounted cash flow projections.  our other current financial assets and current financial liabilities have fair values that approximate their carrying values. inventories  inventories are stated at average cost, subject to the lower of cost or net realizable value. cost includes materials, labor, and manufacturing overhead related to the purchase and production of inventories. net realizable value is the estimated selling price less estimated costs of completion, disposal, and transportation. we regularly review inventory quantities on hand, future purchase commitments with our suppliers, and the estimated utility of our inventory. if our review indicates a reduction in utility below carrying value, we reduce our inventory to a new cost basis through a charge to cost of revenue.  property and equipment  property and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation, and depreciated using the straight-line method over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the asset or the lease term. the estimated useful lives of our property and equipment are generally as follows: computer software developed or acquired for internal use, three to seven years; computer equipment, two to four years; buildings and improvements, five to 15 years; leasehold improvements, three to 20 years; and furniture and equipment, one to 10 years. land is not depreciated.  leases we determine if an arrangement is a lease at inception. operating leases are included in operating lease right-of-use (\u201crou\u201d) assets, other current liabilities, and operating lease liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets. finance leases are included in property and equipment, other current liabilities, and other long-term liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets.  rou assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. operating lease rou assets and liabilities are recognized at commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. as most of our leases do not provide an implicit rate, we generally use our incremental borrowing rate based on the estimated rate of interest for collateralized borrowing over a similar term of the lease payments at commencement date. the operating lease rou asset also includes any lease payments made and excludes lease incentives. our lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. lease expense for lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.  we have lease agreements with lease and non-lease components, which are generally accounted for separately. for certain equipment leases, such as vehicles, we account for the lease and non-lease components as a single lease component. additionally, for certain equipment leases, we apply a portfolio approach to effectively account for the operating lease rou assets and liabilities.  goodwill  goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level (operating segment or one level below an operating segment) on an annual basis (may 1 for us) and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value.  68part ii item 8 \u00a0 intangible assets  our intangible assets are subject to amortization and are amortized using the straight-line method over their estimated period of benefit, ranging from one to 20 years. we evaluate the recoverability of intangible assets periodically by taking into account events or circumstances that may warrant revised estimates of useful lives or that indicate the asset may be impaired.  recent accounting guidance  accounting for income taxes in december 2019, the financial accounting standards board issued a new standard to simplify the accounting for income taxes. the guidance eliminates certain exceptions related to the approach for intraperiod tax allocation, the methodology for calculating income taxes in an interim period, and the recognition of deferred tax liabilities for outside basis differences related to changes in ownership of equity method investments and foreign subsidiaries. the guidance also simplifies aspects of accounting for franchise taxes and enacted changes in tax laws or rates and clarifies the accounting for transactions that result in a step-up in the tax basis of goodwill. we adopted the standard effective july 1, 2021. adoption of the standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. note 2 \u2014 earnings per share basic earnings per share (\u201ceps\u201d) is computed based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. diluted eps is computed based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock plus the effect of dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period using the treasury stock method. dilutive potential common shares include outstanding stock options and stock awards.  the components of basic and diluted eps were as follows:  \u00a0   \u00a0 anti-dilutive stock-based awards excluded from the calculations of diluted eps were immaterial during the periods presented. note 3 \u2014 other income (expense), net  the components of other income (expense), net were as follows:  \u00a0   69part ii item 8 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 net recognized gains (losses) on investments  net recognized gains (losses) on debt investments were as follows:  \u00a0   \u00a0 net recognized gains (losses) on equity investments were as follows: \u00a0   \u00a0 70part ii item 8 \u00a0 \u00a0 note 4\u00a0\u2014\u00a0investments investment components  the components of investments were as follows:  \u00a0   71part ii item 8 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0   \u00a0   \u00a0 equity investments presented as \u201cother\u201d in the tables above include investments without readily determinable fair values measured using the equity method or measured at cost with adjustments for observable changes in price or impairments, and investments measured at fair value using net asset value as a practical expedient which are not categorized in the fair value hierarchy. as of june 30, 2022 and 2021, equity investments without readily determinable fair values measured at cost with adjustments for observable changes in price or impairments were $3.8 billion and $3.3 billion, respectively.  unrealized losses on debt investments  debt investments with continuous unrealized losses for less than 12 months and 12 months or greater and their related fair values were as follows:  \u00a0   72part ii item 8 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0   \u00a0 unrealized losses from fixed-income securities are primarily attributable to changes in interest rates. management does not believe any remaining unrealized losses represent impairments based on our evaluation of available evidence.  debt investment maturities  \u00a0   \u00a0 note 5 \u2014 derivatives  we use derivative instruments to manage risks related to foreign currencies, interest rates, equity prices, and credit; to enhance investment returns; and to facilitate portfolio diversification. our objectives for holding derivatives include reducing, eliminating, and efficiently managing the economic impact of these exposures as effectively as possible. our derivative programs include strategies that both qualify and do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment.  foreign currencies  certain forecasted transactions, assets, and liabilities are exposed to foreign currency risk. we monitor our foreign currency exposures daily to maximize the economic effectiveness of our foreign currency hedge positions.  foreign currency risks related to certain non-u.s. dollar-denominated investments are hedged using foreign exchange forward contracts that are designated as fair value hedging instruments. foreign currency risks related to certain euro-denominated debt are hedged using foreign exchange forward contracts that are designated as cash flow hedging instruments. certain options and forwards not designated as hedging instruments are also used to manage the variability in foreign exchange rates on certain balance sheet amounts and to manage other foreign currency exposures.  interest rate  interest rate risks related to certain fixed-rate debt are hedged using interest rate swaps that are designated as fair value hedging instruments to effectively convert the fixed interest rates to floating interest rates. 73part ii item 8 \u00a0 securities held in our fixed-income portfolio are subject to different interest rate risks based on their maturities. we manage the average maturity of our fixed-income portfolio to achieve economic returns that correlate to certain broad-based fixed-income indices using exchange-traded option and futures contracts and over-the-counter swap and option contracts. these contracts are not designated as hedging instruments and are included in \u201cother contracts\u201d in the tables below. equity  securities held in our equity investments portfolio are subject to market price risk.\u00a0at times, we may hold options, futures, and swap contracts. these contracts are not designated as hedging instruments and are included in \u201cother contracts\u201d in the tables below. credit  our fixed-income portfolio is diversified and consists primarily of investment-grade securities. we use credit default swap contracts to manage credit exposures relative to broad-based indices and to facilitate portfolio diversification. these contracts are not designated as hedging instruments and are included in \u201cother contracts\u201d in the tables below. credit-risk-related contingent features  certain of our counterparty agreements for derivative instruments contain provisions that require our issued and outstanding long-term unsecured debt to maintain an investment grade credit rating and require us to maintain minimum liquidity of $1.0 billion. to the extent we fail to meet these requirements, we will be required to post collateral, similar to the standard convention related to over-the-counter derivatives. as of june 30, 2022, our long-term unsecured debt rating was aaa, and cash investments were in excess of $1.0 billion. as a result, no collateral was required to be posted.  the following table presents the notional amounts of our outstanding derivative instruments measured in u.s. dollar equivalents: \u00a0   \u00a0 74part ii item 8 \u00a0 \u00a0 fair values of derivative instruments  the following table presents our derivative instruments:  \u00a0   gross derivative assets and liabilities subject to legally enforceable master netting agreements for which we have elected to offset were $343 million and $550 million, respectively, as of june 30, 2022, and $395 million and $335 million, respectively, as of june 30, 2021.\u00a0 the following table presents the fair value of our derivatives instruments on a gross basis: \u00a0   \u00a0 75part ii item 8 \u00a0 \u00a0 gains (losses) on derivative instruments recognized in other income (expense), net were as follows: \u00a0   \u00a0 gains (losses), net of tax, on derivative instruments recognized in our consolidated comprehensive income statements were as follows: \u00a0   \u00a0 note 6\u00a0\u2014\u00a0inventories the components of inventories were as follows: \u00a0   \u00a0 76part ii item 8 \u00a0 \u00a0 note 7 \u2014 property and equipment  the components of property and equipment were as follows:  \u00a0   \u00a0 during fiscal years 2022, 2021, and 2020, depreciation expense was $12.6 billion, $9.3 billion, and $10.7 billion, respectively. we have committed $8.5 billion, primarily related to datacenters, for the construction of new buildings, building improvements, and leasehold improvements as of june 30, 2022.  note 8 \u2014 business combinations  nuance communications, inc.  on march 4, 2022, we completed our acquisition of nuance communications, inc. (\u201cnuance\u201d) for a total purchase price of $18.8 billion, consisting primarily of cash. nuance is a cloud and artificial intelligence (\u201cai\u201d) software provider with healthcare and enterprise ai experience, and the acquisition will build on our industry-specific cloud offerings. the financial results of nuance have been included in our consolidated financial statements since the date of the acquisition. nuance is reported as part of our intelligent cloud segment. the purchase price allocation as of the date of acquisition was based on a preliminary valuation and is subject to revision as more detailed analyses are completed and additional information about the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed becomes available. the major classes of assets and liabilities to which we have preliminarily allocated the purchase price were as follows: \u00a0   \u00a0     77part ii item 8 \u00a0 following are the details of the purchase price allocated to the intangible assets acquired: \u00a0   \u00a0 zenimax media inc. on march 9, 2021, we completed our acquisition of zenimax media inc. (\u201czenimax\u201d), the parent company of bethesda softworks llc (\u201cbethesda\u201d), for a total purchase price of $8.1 billion, consisting primarily of cash. the purchase price included $766 million of cash and cash equivalents acquired. bethesda is one of the largest, privately held game developers and publishers in the world, and brings a broad portfolio of games, technology, and talent to xbox. the financial results of zenimax have been included in our consolidated financial statements since the date of the acquisition. zenimax is reported as part of our more personal computing segment. the allocation of the purchase price to goodwill was completed as of december 31, 2021. the major classes of assets and liabilities to which we have allocated the purchase price were as follows: \u00a0   \u00a0 goodwill was assigned to our more personal computing segment. the goodwill was primarily attributed to increased synergies that are expected to be achieved from the integration of zenimax. none of the goodwill is expected to be deductible for income tax purposes. following are details of the purchase price allocated to the intangible assets acquired: \u00a0   \u00a0 activision blizzard, inc. on january 18, 2022, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire activision blizzard, inc. (\u201cactivision blizzard\u201d) for $95.00 per share in an all-cash transaction valued at $68.7 billion, inclusive of activision blizzard\u2019s net cash. activision blizzard is a leader in game development and an interactive entertainment content publisher. the acquisition will accelerate the growth in our gaming business across mobile, pc, console, and cloud and will provide building blocks for the metaverse. the acquisition has been approved by activision blizzard\u2019s shareholders, and we expect it to close in fiscal year 2023, subject to the satisfaction of certain regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions. 78part ii item 8 \u00a0 note 9 \u2014 goodwill  changes in the carrying amount of goodwill were as follows: \u00a0   \u00a0     the measurement periods for the valuation of assets acquired and liabilities assumed end as soon as information on the facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition dates becomes available, but do not exceed 12 months. adjustments in purchase price allocations may require a change in the amounts allocated to goodwill during the periods in which the adjustments are determined.  any change in the goodwill amounts resulting from foreign currency translations and purchase accounting adjustments are presented as \u201cother\u201d in the table above. also included in \u201cother\u201d are business dispositions and transfers between segments due to reorganizations, as applicable.  goodwill impairment we test goodwill for impairment annually on may\u00a01 at the reporting unit level, primarily using a discounted cash flow methodology with a peer-based, risk-adjusted weighted average cost of capital. we believe use of a discounted cash flow approach is the most reliable indicator of the fair values of the businesses.  no instances of impairment were identified in our may 1, 2022, may 1, 2021, or may 1, 2020 tests. as of june 30, 2022 and 2021, accumulated goodwill impairment was $11.3 billion. note 10\u00a0\u2014\u00a0intangible assets  the components of intangible assets, all of which are finite-lived, were as follows:  \u00a0   \u00a0     no material impairments of intangible assets were identified during fiscal years 2022, 2021, or 2020. we estimate that we have no significant residual value related to our intangible assets. 79part ii item 8 \u00a0 the components of intangible assets acquired during the periods presented were as follows:  \u00a0   \u00a0 intangible assets amortization expense was $2.0 billion, $1.6 billion, and $1.6 billion for fiscal years 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively.  the following table outlines the estimated future amortization expense related to intangible assets held as of june 30, 2022: \u00a0   \u00a0 80part ii item 8 \u00a0 \u00a0 note 11\u00a0\u2014\u00a0debt  the components of debt were as follows:  \u00a0   \u00a0     as of june 30, 2022 and 2021, the estimated fair value of long-term debt, including the current portion, was $50.9 billion and $70.0 billion, respectively. the estimated fair values are based on level 2 inputs.  debt in the table above is comprised of senior unsecured obligations and ranks equally with our other outstanding obligations. interest is paid semi-annually, except for the euro-denominated debt, which is paid annually. cash paid for interest on our debt for fiscal years 2022, 2021, and 2020 was $1.9 billion, $2.0 billion, and $2.4 billion, respectively.\u00a0 the following table outlines maturities of our long-term debt, including the current portion, as of june 30, 2022:  \u00a0   \u00a0 81part ii item 8 \u00a0 \u00a0 note 12\u00a0\u2014\u00a0income taxes provision for income taxes\u00a0\u00a0 the components of the provision for income taxes were as follows:  \u00a0   \u00a0 u.s. and foreign components of income before income taxes were as follows:  \u00a0   \u00a0 effective tax rate the items accounting for the difference between income taxes computed at the u.s. federal statutory rate and our effective rate were as follows:  \u00a0   \u00a0 in the first quarter of fiscal year 2022, we transferred certain intangible properties from our puerto rico subsidiary to the u.s. the transfer of intangible properties resulted in a $3.3 billion net income tax benefit in the first quarter of fiscal year 2022, as the value of future u.s. tax deductions exceeds the current tax liability from the u.s. global intangible low-taxed income (\u201cgilti\u201d) tax. \u00a0 82part ii item 8 \u00a0 \u00a0 we have historically paid india withholding taxes on software sales through distributor withholding and tax audit assessments in india. in march 2021, the india supreme court ruled favorably in the case of engineering analysis centre of excellence private limited vs the commissioner of income tax for companies in 86 separate appeals, some dating back to 2012, holding that software sales are not subject to india withholding taxes. although we were not a party to the appeals, our software sales in india were determined to be not subject to withholding taxes. therefore, we recorded a net income tax benefit of $620\u00a0million in the third quarter of fiscal year 2021 to reflect the results of the india supreme court decision impacting fiscal year\u00a01996\u00a0through fiscal year\u00a02016. \u00a0 the decrease from the federal statutory rate in fiscal year 2022 is primarily due to the net income tax benefit related to the transfer of intangible properties, earnings taxed at lower rates in foreign jurisdictions resulting from producing and distributing our products and services through our foreign regional operations center in ireland, and tax benefits relating to stock-based compensation. the decrease from the federal statutory rate in fiscal year 2021 is primarily due to earnings taxed at lower rates in foreign jurisdictions resulting from producing and distributing our products and services through our foreign regional operations centers in ireland and puerto rico, tax benefits relating to stock-based compensation, and tax benefits from the india supreme court decision on withholding taxes. the decrease from the federal statutory rate in fiscal year 2020 is primarily due to earnings taxed at lower rates in foreign jurisdictions resulting from producing and distributing our products and services through our foreign regional operations centers in ireland and puerto rico, and tax benefits relating to stock-based compensation. in fiscal years 2022, 2021, and 2020, our foreign regional operating centers in ireland and puerto rico, which are taxed at rates lower than the u.s. rate, generated 71%, 82%, and 86% of our foreign income before tax. other reconciling items, net consists primarily of tax credits and gilti tax, and in fiscal year 2021, includes tax benefits from the india supreme court decision on withholding taxes. in fiscal years 2022, 2021, and 2020, there were no individually significant other reconciling items. the decrease in our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2022 compared to fiscal year 2021 was primarily due to a $3.3 billion net income tax benefit in the first quarter of fiscal year 2022 related to the transfer of intangible properties, offset in part by changes in the mix of our income before income taxes between the u.s. and foreign countries, as well as tax benefits in the prior year from the india supreme court decision on withholding taxes, an agreement between the u.s. and india tax authorities related to transfer pricing, and final tax cuts and jobs act (\u201ctcja\u201d) regulations. the decrease in our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2021 compared to fiscal year 2020 was primarily due to tax benefits from the india supreme court decision on withholding taxes, an agreement between the u.s. and india tax authorities related to transfer pricing, final tcja regulations, and an increase in tax benefits relating to stock-based compensation. 83part ii item 8 \u00a0 the components of the deferred income tax assets and liabilities were as follows: \u00a0 \u00a0   \u00a0 \u00a0 deferred income tax balances reflect the effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases and are stated at enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when the taxes are paid or recovered.  as of june 30, 2022, we had federal, state, and foreign net operating loss carryforwards of $318 million, $1.3 billion, and $2.1 billion, respectively. the federal and state net operating loss carryforwards will expire in various years from fiscal 2023 through 2042, if not utilized. the majority of our foreign net operating loss carryforwards do not expire. certain acquired net operating loss carryforwards are subject to an annual limitation but are expected to be realized with the exception of those which have a valuation allowance. as of june 30, 2022, we had $1.3 billion federal capital loss carryforwards for u.s. tax purposes from our acquisition of nuance. the federal capital loss carryforwards are subject to an annual limitation and will expire in various years from fiscal 2023 through 2025. the valuation allowance disclosed in the table above relates to the foreign net operating loss carryforwards, federal capital loss carryforwards, and other net deferred tax assets that may not be realized.  income taxes paid, net of refunds, were $16.0 billion, $13.4 billion, and $12.5 billion in fiscal years 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively.  uncertain tax positions gross unrecognized tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions as of june 30, 2022, 2021, and 2020, were $15.6 billion, $14.6 billion, and $13.8 billion, respectively, which were primarily included in long-term income taxes in our consolidated balance sheets. if recognized, the resulting tax benefit would affect our effective tax rates for fiscal years 2022, 2021, and 2020 by $13.3 billion, $12.5 billion, and $12.1 billion, respectively. 84part ii item 8 \u00a0 as of june 30, 2022, 2021, and 2020, we had accrued interest expense related to uncertain tax positions of $4.3 billion, $4.3 billion, and $4.0 billion, respectively, net of income tax benefits. the provision for income taxes for fiscal years 2022, 2021, and 2020 included interest expense related to uncertain tax positions of $36 million, $274 million, and $579 million, respectively, net of income tax benefits. the aggregate changes in the gross unrecognized tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions were as follows:  \u00a0   \u00a0 we settled a portion of the internal revenue service (\u201cirs\u201d) audit for tax years 2004 to 2006 in fiscal year 2011. in february 2012, the irs withdrew its 2011 revenue agents report related to unresolved issues for tax years 2004 to 2006 and reopened the audit phase of the examination. we also settled a portion of the irs audit for tax years 2007 to 2009 in fiscal year 2016, and a portion of the irs audit for tax years 2010 to 2013 in fiscal year 2018. in the second quarter of fiscal year 2021, we settled an additional portion of the irs audits for tax years 2004 to 2013 and made a payment of $1.7 billion, including tax and interest. we remain under audit for tax years 2004 to 2017. as of june 30, 2022, the primary unresolved issues for the irs audits relate to transfer pricing, which could have a material impact in our consolidated financial statements when the matters are resolved. we believe our allowances for income tax contingencies are adequate. we have not received a proposed assessment for the unresolved key transfer pricing issues and do not expect a final resolution of these issues in the next 12 months.\u00a0based on the information currently available, we do not anticipate a significant increase or decrease to our tax contingencies for these issues within the next 12 months. we are subject to income tax in many jurisdictions outside the u.s. our operations in certain jurisdictions remain subject to examination for tax years 1996 to 2021, some of which are currently under audit by local tax authorities. the resolution of each of these audits is not expected to be material to our consolidated financial statements.\u00a0 \u00a0 note 13 \u2014 unearned revenue  unearned revenue by segment was as follows:  \u00a0   \u00a0 changes in unearned revenue were as follows:  \u00a0   \u00a0 85part ii item 8 \u00a0 \u00a0 revenue allocated to remaining performance obligations, which includes unearned revenue and amounts that will be invoiced and recognized as revenue in future periods, was $193 billion as of june 30, 2022, of which $189 billion is related to the commercial portion of revenue. we expect to recognize approximately 45% of this revenue over the next 12 months and the remainder thereafter. note 14\u00a0\u2014\u00a0leases  we have operating and finance leases for datacenters, corporate offices, research and development facilities, microsoft experience centers, and certain equipment. our leases have remaining lease terms of 1 year to 19 years, some of which include options to extend the leases for up to 5 years, and some of which include options to terminate the leases within 1 year.  the components of lease expense were as follows:  \u00a0   \u00a0 \u00a0 supplemental cash flow information related to leases was as follows: \u00a0   \u00a0 86part ii item 8 \u00a0 \u00a0 supplemental balance sheet information related to leases was as follows: \u00a0   \u00a0 the following table outlines maturities of our lease liabilities as of june 30, 2022: \u00a0   \u00a0 as of june 30, 2022, we have additional operating and finance leases, primarily for datacenters, that have not yet commenced of $7.2 billion and $8.8 billion, respectively. these operating and finance leases will commence between fiscal year 2023 and fiscal year 2028 with lease terms of 1 year to 18 years. \u00a0 87part ii item 8 \u00a0 \u00a0 note 15 \u2014 contingencies antitrust litigation and claims  china state administration for market regulation investigation  in 2014, microsoft was informed that china\u2019s state agency for market regulation (\u201csamr\u201d) (formerly state administration for industry and commerce) had begun a formal investigation relating to china\u2019s anti-monopoly law, and the samr conducted onsite inspections of microsoft offices in beijing, shanghai, guangzhou, and chengdu. in 2019, the samr presented preliminary views as to certain possible violations of china\u2019s anti-monopoly law. product-related litigation   u.s. cell phone litigation  microsoft mobile oy, a subsidiary of microsoft, along with other handset manufacturers and network operators, is a defendant in 46 lawsuits, including 45 lawsuits filed in the superior court for the district of columbia by individual plaintiffs who allege that radio emissions from cellular handsets caused their brain tumors and other adverse health effects. we assumed responsibility for these claims in our agreement to acquire nokia\u2019s devices and services business and have been substituted for the nokia defendants. nine of these cases were filed in 2002 and are consolidated for certain pre-trial proceedings; the remaining cases are stayed. in a separate 2009 decision, the court of appeals for the district of columbia held that adverse health effect claims arising from the use of cellular handsets that operate within the u.s. federal communications commission radio frequency emission guidelines (\u201cfcc guidelines\u201d) are pre-empted by federal law. the plaintiffs allege that their handsets either operated outside the fcc guidelines or were manufactured before the fcc guidelines went into effect. the lawsuits also allege an industry-wide conspiracy to manipulate the science and testing around emission guidelines.  in 2013, the defendants in the consolidated cases moved to exclude the plaintiffs\u2019 expert evidence of general causation on the basis of flawed scientific methodologies. in 2014, the trial court granted in part and denied in part the defendants\u2019 motion to exclude the plaintiffs\u2019 general causation experts. the defendants filed an interlocutory appeal to the district of columbia court of appeals challenging the standard for evaluating expert scientific evidence. in october 2016, the court of appeals issued its decision adopting the standard advocated by the defendants and remanding the cases to the trial court for further proceedings under that standard. the plaintiffs have filed supplemental expert evidence, portions of which the defendants have moved to strike. in august 2018, the trial court issued an order striking portions of the plaintiffs\u2019 expert reports. a hearing on general causation is scheduled for september of 2022. other contingencies  we also are subject to a variety of other claims and suits that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of our business. although management currently believes that resolving claims against us, individually or in aggregate, will not have a material adverse impact in our consolidated financial statements, these matters are subject to inherent uncertainties and management\u2019s view of these matters may change in the future.  as of june 30, 2022, we accrued aggregate legal liabilities of $364 million. while we intend to defend these matters vigorously, adverse outcomes that we estimate could reach approximately $600 million in aggregate beyond recorded amounts are reasonably possible. were unfavorable final outcomes to occur, there exists the possibility of a material adverse impact in our consolidated financial statements for the period in which the effects become reasonably estimable.  88part ii item 8 \u00a0 note 16\u00a0\u2014\u00a0stockholders\u2019 equity  shares outstanding  shares of common stock outstanding were as follows:  \u00a0

segments. however, due to the integrated structure of our business, certain revenue recognized and costs incurred by one segment may benefit other segments. revenue from certain contracts is allocated among the segments based on the relative value of the underlying products and services, which can include allocation based on actual prices charged, prices when sold separately, or estimated costs plus a profit margin. cost of revenue is allocated in certain cases based on a relative revenue methodology. operating expenses that are allocated primarily include those relating to marketing of products and services from which multiple segments benefit and are generally allocated based on relative gross margin.  in addition, certain costs incurred at a corporate level that are identifiable and that benefit our segments are allocated to them. these allocated costs include legal, including settlements and fines, information technology, human resources, finance, excise taxes, field

(pcaob), the company's internal control over financial reporting as of june 30, 2022, based on criteria established in internal control \u2014 integrated framework (2013) issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission and our report dated july 28, 2022, expressed an unqualified opinion on the company's internal control over financial reporting. basis for opinion these financial statements are the responsibility of the company's management. our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company's financial statements based on our audits. we are a public accounting firm registered with the pcaob and are required to be independent with respect to the company in accordance with the u.s. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the securities and exchange commission and the pcaob. we conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the pcaob. those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. we believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. critical audit matters the critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. the communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.  96part ii item 8 \u00a0 \u00a0 revenue recognition \u2013 refer to note 1 to the financial statements critical audit matter description the company recognizes revenue upon transfer of control of promised products or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration the company expects to receive in exchange for those products or services. the company offers customers the ability to acquire multiple licenses of software products and services, including cloud-based services, in its customer agreements through its volume licensing programs. significant judgment is exercised by the company in determining revenue recognition for these customer agreements, and includes the following:         given these factors and due to the volume of transactions, the related audit effort in evaluating management's judgments in determining revenue recognition for these customer agreements was extensive and required a high degree of auditor judgment. how the critical audit matter was addressed in the audit our principal audit procedures related to the company's revenue recognition for these customer agreements included the following:                  97part ii item 8 \u00a0 \u00a0 income taxes \u2013 uncertain tax positions \u2013 refer to note 12 to the financial statements critical audit matter description the company's long-term income taxes liability includes uncertain tax positions related to transfer pricing issues that remain unresolved with the internal revenue service (\"irs\"). the company remains under irs audit, or subject to irs audit, for tax years subsequent to 2003. while the company has settled a portion of the irs audits, resolution of the remaining matters could have a material impact on the company's financial statements.  conclusions on recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions involve significant estimates and management judgment and include complex considerations of the internal revenue code, related regulations, tax case laws, and prior-year audit settlements. given the complexity and the subjective nature of the transfer pricing issues that remain unresolved with the irs, evaluating management's estimates relating to their determination of uncertain tax positions required extensive audit effort and a high degree of auditor judgment, including involvement of our tax specialists. how the critical audit matter was addressed in the audit our principal audit procedures to evaluate management's estimates of uncertain tax positions related to unresolved transfer pricing issues included the following:           \u00a0 /s/ deloitte\u00a0& touche llp \u00a0 seattle, washington july 28, 2022 \u00a0 we have served as the company's auditor since 1983.

have concluded that these disclosure controls and procedures are effective.  report of management on internal control over financial reporting  our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for the company. internal control over financial reporting is a process to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america. internal control over financial reporting includes maintaining records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect our transactions; providing reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary for preparation of our consolidated financial statements; providing reasonable assurance that receipts and expenditures of company assets are made in accordance with management authorization; and providing reasonable assurance that

over financial reporting a company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. a company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. \u00a0 /s/ deloitte\u00a0& touche llp \u00a0 seattle, washington july 28, 2022

platform-based ecosystems on which many participants can build diverse solutions. a well-established ecosystem creates beneficial network effects among users, application developers, and the platform provider that can accelerate growth. establishing significant scale in the marketplace is necessary to achieve and maintain attractive margins. the strategic importance of developing and maintaining a vibrant ecosystem increased with the launch of the windows 8 operating system, surface, windows phone, xbox one, and associated cloud-based services. we face significant competition from firms that provide competing platforms, applications, and services.  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 business model competition  companies compete with us based on a growing variety of business models.  \u00a0 \u00a0 16  table of contents  \u00a0 part i  item 1a  \u00a0 \u00a0 the competitive pressures described above may cause decreased sales volumes, price reductions, and/or increased operating costs, such as for research and development, marketing, and sales incentives. this may lead to lower revenue, gross margins, and operating income.  our increasing focus on services presents execution and competitive risks.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0a growing part of our business involves cloud-based services available across the spectrum of computing devices. in july 2014, our leadership announced its strategic vision to compete and grow as a productivity and platform company for the mobile-first and cloud-first world. at the same time, our competitors are rapidly developing and deploying cloud-based services for consumers and business customers. pricing and delivery models are evolving. devices and form factors influence how users access services in the cloud and sometimes the user\u0092s choice of which suite of cloud-based services to use. we are devoting significant resources to develop and deploy our cloud-based strategies. the windows ecosystem must continue to evolve with this changing environment. we are embracing cultural and organizational changes to drive accountability and eliminate obstacles to innovation. besides software development costs, we are incurring costs to build and maintain infrastructure to support cloud computing services. these costs will reduce the operating margins we have previously achieved. whether we succeed in cloud-based services depends on our execution in several areas, including:  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 it is uncertain whether our strategies will attract the users or generate the revenue required to succeed. if we are not effective in executing organizational changes to increase efficiency and accelerate innovation, or if we fail to generate sufficient usage of our new products and services, we may not grow revenues in line with the infrastructure and development investments described above. this may negatively impact gross margins and operating income.  we make significant investments in new products and services that may not be profitable.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0we will continue to make significant investments in research, development, and marketing for existing products, services, and technologies, including the windows operating system, the microsoft office system, bing, windows phone, windows server, the windows store, the microsoft azure services platform, office 365, other cloud-based services offerings, and the xbox entertainment platform. we also invest in the development and acquisition of a variety of hardware for productivity, communication and entertainment including pcs, tablets, phones, and gaming devices. investments in new technology are speculative. commercial success depends on many factors, including innovativeness, developer support, and effective distribution and marketing. if customers do not perceive our latest offerings as providing significant new functionality or other value, they may reduce their purchases of new software and hardware products or upgrades, unfavorably affecting revenue. we may not achieve significant revenue from new product, service, and  \u00a0 17  table of contents  \u00a0 part i  item 1a  \u00a0  distribution channel investments for several years, if at all. new products and services may not be profitable, and even if they are profitable, operating margins for some new products and businesses will not be as high as the margins we have experienced historically.  developing new technologies is complex and time-consuming. it can require long development and testing periods. significant delays in new releases or significant problems in creating new products or services could adversely affect our revenue.  acquisitions, joint ventures, and strategic alliances may have an adverse effect on our business.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0we expect to continue making acquisitions or entering into joint ventures and strategic alliances as part of our long-term business strategy. these transactions involve significant challenges and risks including that the transaction does not advance our business strategy, that we get no satisfactory return on our investment, that we have difficulty integrating new employees, business systems, and technology, or that the transaction distracts management from our other businesses. the success of these transactions will depend in part on our ability to leverage them enhance our existing products and services or develop compelling new ones. it may take longer than expected to realize the full benefits from these transactions, such as increased revenue, enhanced efficiencies, or increased market share, or the benefits may ultimately be smaller than we expected. these events could adversely affect our operating results or financial condition.  in april 2014, we acquired from nokia substantially all of its nds business to accelerate our growth in phones and support the entire windows ecosystem. we may not realize all of the anticipated financial and other benefits from this transaction including operating efficiencies and cost savings. we may not be successful in developing a vibrant and competitive ecosystem for windows-based phones that combines differentiated hardware, software, services, and third-party applications. we may not achieve mobile phone market share targets. we may see lower than expected growth rates for the phone markets. the mix of premium and lower-cost devices we sell may put downward pressure on prices or margins. we may not be effective in executing the restructuring we announced in july 2014 or otherwise integrating the nds business with microsoft\u0092s ongoing operations, including matching manufacturing capacity to demand. existing microsoft smart device original equipment manufacturers may respond negatively to the changes in our business or the new competitive environment.  if our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets become impaired we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0we acquire other companies and intangible assets and may not realize all the economic benefit from those acquisitions, which could cause an impairment of goodwill or intangibles. we review our amortizable intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. we test goodwill for impairment at least annually. factors that may be a change in circumstances, indicating that the carrying value of our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets may not be recoverable, include a decline in our stock price and market capitalization, reduced future cash flow estimates, and slower growth rates in industry segments in which we participate. we may be required to record a significant charge in our consolidated financial statements during the period in which any impairment of our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets is determined, negatively affecting our results of operations. for example, in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2012, we recorded a $6.2 billion charge for the impairment of goodwill in our previous online services division business (devices and consumer other under our current segment structure).  the valuation of acquired assets and liabilities, including goodwill, resulting from the acquisition of nds, is reflective of the enterprise value based on the long-term financial forecast for the business.\u00a0in this highly competitive and volatile market, we may not realize our forecasts. as a result, we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings in our consolidated financial statements due to an impairment of our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets.  we may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property rights.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0protecting our global intellectual property rights and combating unlicensed copying and use of our software and other intellectual property is difficult. while piracy adversely affects u.s. revenue, the impact on revenue from outside the u.s. is more significant, particularly in countries where laws are less protective of intellectual property rights. our revenue in these markets may grow slower than the underlying device market. similarly, the absence of harmonized patent laws makes it more difficult to ensure consistent respect for patent rights. throughout the world, we educate consumers about the  \u00a0 18  table of contents  \u00a0 part i  item 1a  \u00a0  benefits of licensing genuine products and obtaining indemnification benefits for intellectual property risks, and we educate lawmakers about the advantages of a business climate where intellectual property rights are protected. reductions in the legal protection for software intellectual property rights could adversely affect revenue.  third parties may claim we infringe their intellectual property rights.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0from time to time, others claim we infringe their intellectual property rights. the number of these claims may grow because of constant technological change in the markets in which we compete, the extensive patent coverage of existing technologies, the rapid rate of issuance of new patents, and our offering of first-party devices, such as surface and lumia phones. to resolve these claims we may enter into royalty and licensing agreements on terms that are less favorable than currently available, stop selling or redesign affected products or services, or pay damages to satisfy indemnification commitments with our customers. these outcomes may cause operating margins to decline. besides money damages, in some jurisdictions plaintiffs can seek injunctive relief that may limit or prevent importing, marketing, and selling our products or services that have infringing technologies. in some countries, such as germany, an injunction can be issued before the parties have fully litigated the validity of the underlying patents. we have paid significant amounts to settle claims related to the use of technology and intellectual property rights and to procure intellectual property rights as part of our strategy to manage this risk, and may continue to do so.  we may not be able to protect our source code from copying if there is an unauthorized disclosure of source code.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0source code, the detailed program commands for our operating systems and other software programs, is critical to our business. although we license portions of our application and operating system source code to several licensees, we take significant measures to protect the secrecy of large portions of our source code. if a significant portion of our source code leaks, we might lose future trade secret protection for that source code. it may become easier for third parties to compete with our products by copying functionality, which could adversely affect our revenue and operating margins. unauthorized disclosure of source code also could increase the security risks described in the next paragraph.  cyber-attacks and security vulnerabilities could lead to reduced revenue, increased costs, liability claims, or harm to our competitive position.  security of microsoft\u0092s information technology  threats to information technology (\u0093it\u0094) security can take a variety of forms. individual and groups of hackers, and sophisticated organizations including state-sponsored organizations, may take steps that pose threats to our customers and our it.\u00a0they may develop and deploy malicious software to attack our products and services and gain access to our networks and datacenters, or act in a coordinated manner to launch distributed denial of service or other coordinated attacks. cyber threats are constantly evolving, thereby increasing the difficulty of detecting and successfully defending against them. cyber threats can have cascading impacts that unfold with increasing speed across our internal networks and systems and those of our partners and customers. breaches of our network or data security could disrupt the security of our internal systems and business applications, impair our ability to provide services to our customers and protect the privacy of their data, result in product development delays, compromise confidential or technical business information harming our competitive position, result in theft or misuse of our intellectual property or other assets, require us to allocate more resources to improved technologies, or otherwise adversely affect our business.  in addition, our internal it environment continues to evolve. often we are early adopters of new devices and technologies. we embrace new ways of sharing data and communicating internally and with partners and customers using methods such as social networking and other consumer-oriented technologies. our business policies and internal security controls may not keep pace with the speed of these changes as new threats emerge.  security of our product, services, devices and customers\u0092 data  security threats are a particular challenge to companies like us whose business is technology products and services. threats to our own it infrastructure can also affect our customers. customers using our cloud-based services rely on the security of our infrastructure to ensure the reliability of our services and the protection of their data. hackers  \u00a0 19  table of contents  \u00a0 part i  item 1a  \u00a0  tend to focus their efforts on the most popular operating systems, programs, and services, including many of ours, and we expect that to continue. the security of our products and services is important in our customers\u0092 purchasing decisions.  to defend against security threats, both to our internal it systems and those of our customers, we must continuously engineer more secure products and services, enhance security and reliability features, improve the deployment of software updates to address security vulnerabilities, develop mitigation technologies that help to secure customers from attacks even when software updates are not deployed, maintain the digital security infrastructure that protects the integrity of our network, products and services, and provide customers security tools such as firewalls and anti-virus software.  the cost of these steps could reduce our operating margins. if we fail to do these things well, actual or perceived security vulnerabilities in our products and services could harm our reputation and lead customers to reduce or delay future purchases of products or subscriptions to services, or to use competing products or services. customers may also spend more on protecting their existing computer systems from attack, which could delay adoption of additional products or services. customers may fail to update their systems, continue to run software or operating systems we no longer support, or may fail timely to install security patches. any of these actions by customers could adversely affect our revenue. actual or perceived vulnerabilities may lead to claims against us. although our license agreements typically contain provisions that eliminate or limit our exposure to liability, there is no assurance these provisions will withstand legal challenges. legislative or regulatory action in these areas may increase the costs to develop, implement or secure our products and services.  disclosure of personal data could cause liability and harm our reputation.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0as we continue to grow the number and scale of our cloud-based offerings, we store and process increasingly large amounts of personally identifiable information of our customers. the continued occurrence of high-profile data breaches provides evidence of an external environment increasingly hostile to information security. despite our efforts to improve the security controls across our business groups and geographies, it is possible our security controls over personal data, our training of employees and vendors on data security, and other practices we follow may not prevent the improper disclosure of customer data we or our vendors store and manage. improper disclosure could harm our reputation, lead to legal exposure to customers, or subject us to liability under laws that protect personal data, resulting in increased costs or loss of revenue. our software products and services also enable our customers to store and process personal data on-premises or, increasingly, in a cloud-based environment we host. like all providers of communications services, government authorities can sometimes require us to produce customer data in response to valid legal orders. in the u.s. and elsewhere, we advocate for transparency concerning these requests and appropriate limitations on government authority to compel disclosure. despite our efforts to protect customer data, perceptions that the privacy of personal information is not satisfactorily protected could inhibit sales of our products or services, and could limit adoption of our cloud-based solutions by consumers, businesses, and government entities. additional security measures we may take to address customer concerns, or constraints on our flexibility to determine where and how to operate datacenters in response to customer expectations or governmental rules or actions, may cause higher operating expenses.  we may have outages, data losses, and disruptions of our online services if we fail to maintain an adequate operations infrastructure.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0our increasing user traffic, growth in services and the complexity of our products and services demand more computing power. we spend substantial amounts to build, purchase or lease datacenters and equipment and to upgrade our technology and network infrastructure to handle more traffic on our websites and in our datacenters. these demands continue to increase as we introduce new products and services and support the growth of existing services such as bing, exchange online, office 365, sharepoint online, onedrive, skype, xbox live, microsoft azure, outlook.com, microsoft office web apps, windows stores and microsoft account services. we are rapidly growing our business of providing a platform and back-end hosting for services provided by third-parties to their end users. maintaining, securing and expanding this infrastructure is expensive and complex. inefficiencies or operational failures, including temporary or permanent loss of customer data, could diminish the quality of our products, services, and user experience resulting in contractual liability, claims by customers and other third parties, damage to our reputation and loss of current and potential users, subscribers, and advertisers, each of which may harm our operating results and financial condition.  \u00a0 20  table of contents  \u00a0 part i  item 1a  \u00a0 government litigation and regulatory activity relating to competition rules may limit how we design and market our products.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0as a leading global software and device maker, we are closely scrutinized by government agencies under u.s. and foreign competition laws. an increasing number of governments are regulating competition law activities and this includes increased scrutiny in potentially large markets such as china. some jurisdictions also allow competitors or consumers to assert claims of anti-competitive conduct. u.s. federal and state antitrust authorities have previously brought enforcement actions and continue to scrutinize our business.  the european commission closely scrutinizes the design of high-volume microsoft products and the terms on which we make certain technologies used in these products, such as file formats, programming interfaces, and protocols, available to other companies. in 2004, the commission ordered us to create new versions of windows that do not include certain multimedia technologies and to provide our competitors with specifications for how to implement certain proprietary windows communications protocols in their own products. in 2009, the commission accepted a set of commitments offered by microsoft to address the commission\u0092s concerns relating to competition in web browsing software, including an undertaking to address commission concerns relating to interoperability. these obligations may limit our ability to innovate in windows or other products in the future, diminish the developer appeal of the windows platform, and increase our product development costs. the availability of licenses related to protocols and file formats may enable competitors to develop software products that better mimic the functionality of our products, which could hamper sales of our\u00a0products.  our portfolio of first-party devices continues to grow; at the same time our oem partners offer a large variety of devices on our platforms. as a result, increasingly we both cooperate and compete with our oem partners, creating a risk that we fail to do so in compliance with competition rules. regulatory scrutiny in this area may increase. certain foreign governments, particularly in china and other countries in asia, have advanced arguments under their competition laws that exert downward pressure on royalties for our intellectual property. because these jurisdictions only recently implemented competition laws, their enforcement activities are unpredictable.  government regulatory actions and court decisions such as these may hinder our ability to provide the benefits of our software to consumers and businesses, reducing the attractiveness of our products and the revenue that come from them. new competition law actions could be initiated. the outcome of such actions, or steps taken to avoid them, could adversely affect us in a variety of ways, including:  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 our international operations subject us to potential liability under anti-corruption, trade protection, and other laws and regulations.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0the foreign corrupt practices act and other anti-corruption laws and regulations (\u0093anti-corruption laws\u0094) prohibit corrupt payments by our employees, vendors, or agents. from time to time, we receive inquiries from authorities in the u.s. and elsewhere about our business activities outside the u.s. and our compliance with anti-corruption laws. while we devote substantial resources to our global compliance programs and have implemented policies, training, and internal controls designed to reduce the risk of corrupt payments, our employees, vendors, or agents may violate our policies. our failure to comply with anti-corruption laws could result in significant fines and penalties, criminal sanctions against us, our officers or our employees, prohibitions on the conduct of our business, and damage to our reputation. operations outside the u.s. may be affected by changes in trade protection laws, policies and measures, and other regulatory requirements affecting trade and investment. we may be subject to legal liability and reputational damage if we sell goods or services in violation of u.s. trade sanctions on countries such as iran, north korea, cuba, sudan, and syria.  \u00a0 21  table of contents  \u00a0 part i  item 1a  \u00a0 other regulatory areas that may apply to our products and online services offerings include user privacy, telecommunications, data protection, and online content. for example, regulators may take the position that our offerings such as skype are covered by laws regulating telecommunications services. applying these laws and regulations to our business is often unclear, subject to change over time, and sometimes may conflict from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. additionally, these laws and governments\u0092 approach to their enforcement, and our products and services, are continuing to evolve. some governments are expressing increasing concern about government surveillance practices around the world and this may lead to increased regulation requiring local hosting obligations or the use of domestic hosting providers. compliance with these types of regulation may involve significant costs or require changes in products or business practices that result in reduced revenue. noncompliance could result in the imposition of penalties or orders we stop the alleged noncompliant activity.  our business depends on our ability to attract and retain talented employees.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0our business is based on successfully attracting and retaining talented employees. the market for highly skilled workers and leaders in our industry is extremely competitive. we are limited in our ability to recruit internationally by restrictive domestic immigration laws. if we are less successful in our recruiting efforts, or if we cannot retain key employees, including key employees of the nds business acquired in april\u00a02014, our ability to develop and deliver successful products and services may be adversely affected. effective succession planning is also important to our long-term success. failure to ensure effective transfer of knowledge and smooth transitions involving key employees could hinder our strategic planning and execution.  we have claims and lawsuits against us that may result in adverse outcomes.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0we are subject to a variety of claims and lawsuits. adverse outcomes in some or all of these claims may result in significant monetary damages or injunctive relief that could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business. the litigation and other claims are subject to inherent uncertainties and management\u0092s view of these matters may change in the future. a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements could occur for the period in which the effect of an unfavorable final outcome becomes probable and reasonably estimable.  we may have additional tax liabilities.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0we are subject to income taxes in the u.s. and many foreign jurisdictions. significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes. in the ordinary course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. we regularly are under audit by tax authorities. economic\u00a0and political\u00a0pressures to increase tax revenues in various jurisdictions may make resolving tax disputes more difficult. although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals. the results of an audit or litigation could have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements in the period or periods for which that determination is made.  we earn a significant amount of our operating income from outside the u.s., and any repatriation of funds currently held in foreign jurisdictions to the u.s. may result in higher effective tax rates for the company. in addition, there have been proposals from congress to change u.s. tax laws that would significantly impact how u.s. multinational corporations are taxed on foreign earnings. although we cannot predict whether or in what form any proposed legislation may pass, if enacted it could have a material adverse impact on our tax expense and cash flows.  our hardware and software products may experience quality or supply problems.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0our vertically-integrated hardware products such as xbox consoles, surface devices, lumia smartphones, and other devices we design and market are highly complex and can have defects in design, manufacture, or associated software. we could incur significant expenses, lost revenue, and reputational harm if we fail to detect or address such issues through design, testing, or warranty repairs. we get some device components from sole suppliers. our competitors use some of the same suppliers and their demand for hardware components can affect the capacity available to us. if a component from a sole-source supplier is delayed or becomes unavailable, whether because of supplier capacity constraint or industry shortages, we may not obtain timely replacement supplies, resulting in reduced sales. component shortages, excess or obsolete inventory, or price reductions resulting in inventory adjustments may increase our cost of revenue. xbox consoles and surface devices and lumia phones are assembled in asia and other geographies that may be subject to disruptions in the supply chain, resulting in shortages that would affect our revenue and operating margins. these same risks would apply to any other vertically-integrated hardware and software products we may offer.  \u00a0 22  table of contents  \u00a0 part i  item 1a  \u00a0 our software products also may experience quality or reliability problems. the highly sophisticated software products we develop may contain bugs and other defects that interfere with their intended operation. any defects we do not detect and fix in pre-release testing could cause reduced sales and revenue, damage to our reputation, repair or remediation costs, delays in the release of new products or versions, or legal liability. although our license agreements typically contain provisions that eliminate or limit our exposure to liability, there is no assurance these provisions will withstand legal challenge.  our global business exposes us to operational and economic risks.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0we operate in over 100 countries and a significant part of our revenue comes from international sales. the global nature of our business creates operational and economic risks. emerging markets are a significant focus of our international growth strategy. the developing nature of these markets presents several risks, including deterioration of social, political, labor, or economic conditions in a country or region, and difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations. although we hedge a portion of our international currency exposure, significant fluctuations in exchange rates between the u.s. dollar and foreign currencies may adversely affect our revenue. competitive or regulatory pressure to make our pricing structure uniform might require that we reduce the sales price of our software in the u.s. and other countries.  catastrophic events or geo-political conditions may disrupt our business.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0a disruption or failure of our systems or operations because of a major earthquake, weather event, cyber-attack, terrorist attack, or other catastrophic event could cause delays in completing sales, providing services, or performing other critical functions. our corporate headquarters, a significant portion of our research and development activities, and certain other essential business operations are in the seattle, washington area, and we have other business operations in the silicon valley area of california, both of which are near major earthquake faults. a catastrophic event that results in the destruction or disruption of any of our critical business or it systems could harm our ability to conduct normal business operations. providing our customers with more services and solutions in the cloud puts a premium on the resilience of our systems and strength of our business continuity management plans, and magnifies the potential impact of prolonged service outages on our operating results.  abrupt political change, terrorist activity, and armed conflict pose a risk of general economic disruption in affected countries, which may increase our operating costs. these conditions also may add uncertainty to the timing and budget for technology investment decisions by our customers, and may cause supply chain disruptions for hardware manufacturers, either of which may adversely affect our revenue. the long-term effects of climate change on the global economy or the it industry in particular are unclear. environmental regulations or changes in the supply, demand or available sources of energy may affect the availability or cost of goods and services, including natural resources, necessary to run our business. changes in weather where we operate may increase the costs of powering and cooling computer hardware we use to develop software and provide cloud-based services.  adverse economic or market conditions may harm our business.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0worsening economic conditions, including inflation, recession, or other changes in economic conditions, may cause lower it spending and adversely affect our revenue. if demand for pcs, servers, and other computing devices declines, or consumer or business spending for those products declines, our revenue will be adversely affected. substantial revenue comes from our u.s. government contracts. an extended federal government shutdown resulting from failing to pass budget appropriations, adopt continuing funding resolutions or raise the debt ceiling, and other budgetary decisions limiting or delaying federal government spending, could reduce government it spending on our products and services and adversely affect our revenues. our product distribution system also relies on an extensive partner and retail network. oems building devices that run our software have also been a significant means of distribution. the impact of economic conditions on our partners, such as the bankruptcy of a major distributor, oem, or retailer, could cause sales channel disruption. challenging economic conditions also may impair the ability of our customers to pay for products and services they have purchased. as a result, allowances for doubtful accounts and write-offs of accounts receivable may increase. we maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings, types, and maturities. these investments are subject to general credit, liquidity, market, and interest rate risks, which may be exacerbated by unusual events that affect global financial markets. a significant part of our investment portfolio comprises u.s. government securities. if global credit and equity markets decline for long periods, or if there is a downgrade of the u.s. government credit rating due to an actual or threatened default on government debt, our investment portfolio may be adversely affected and we could determine that more of our investments have experienced an other-than-temporary decline in fair value, requiring impairment charges that could adversely affect our financial results.  \u00a0 23  table of contents  \u00a0 part ii  item 7  \u00a0 with investments in these areas, we work to fulfill the evolving needs of our customers in a mobile-first and cloud-first world. we view mobility broadly \u0096 not just by devices, but by experiences. today, people move just as quickly into new contexts as to new locations. mobility goes beyond devices users carry with them as they move from place to place, to encompass the rich collection of data, applications, and services that accompany them as they move from setting to setting in their lives. many of our customers are \u0093dual users,\u0094 employing technology for work or school and also deeply in their personal lives.  digital work and life experiences  we believe we can significantly enhance the digital lives of our customers using our broad portfolio of communication, productivity, and information services. we work to deliver digital work and life experiences that are reinvented for the mobile-first and cloud-first world. productivity will be the first and foremost objective, to enable people to meet and collaborate more easily, and to effectively express ideas in new ways. we will design applications as dual use with the intelligence to partition data between work and life while respecting each person\u0092s privacy choices. the foundation for these efforts will rest on advancing our leading productivity, collaboration, and business process tools including skype, onedrive, onenote, outlook, word, excel, powerpoint, bing, and dynamics.  we see opportunity in combining these services in new ways that are more contextual and personal, while ensuring people, rather than their devices, remain at the center of the digital experience. we will offer our services across ecosystems and devices outside our own. as people move from device to device, so will their content and the richness of their services. we will engineer applications so users can find, try, and buy them in friction-free ways.  cloud operating system  today, businesses face important opportunities and challenges. enterprises are asked to deploy technology that advances business strategy. they decide what solutions will make employees more productive, collaborative, and satisfied, or connect with customers in new and compelling ways. they work to unlock business insights from a world of data. they rely on our technology to manage employee corporate identity, and to manage and secure corporate information accessed and stored across a growing number of devices. to achieve these objectives increasingly businesses look to leverage the benefits of the cloud. helping businesses move to the cloud is one of our largest opportunities, and we believe we work from a position of strength.  the shift to the cloud is driven by three important economies of scale: larger datacenters can deploy computational resources at significantly lower cost per unit than smaller ones; larger datacenters can coordinate and aggregate diverse customer, geographic, and application demand patterns improving the utilization of computing, storage, and network resources; and multi-tenancy lowers application maintenance labor costs for large public clouds. the cloud creates the opportunity for businesses to focus on innovation while leaving non-differentiating activities to reliable and cost-effective providers.  with azure, we are one of very few cloud vendors that run at a scale that meets the needs of businesses of all sizes and complexities. we believe the combination of azure and windows server makes us the only company with a public, private, and hybrid cloud platform that can power modern business. we are working to enhance the return on it investment by enabling enterprises to combine their existing datacenters and our public cloud into a single cohesive infrastructure. businesses can deploy applications in their own datacenter, a partner\u0092s datacenter, or in our datacenters with common security, management, and administration across all environments, with the flexibility and scale they desire.  our cloud will also enable richer employee experiences. we enable organizations to securely adopt software-as-a-service applications (both our own and third-party) and integrate them with their existing security and management infrastructure. we will continue to innovate with higher level services including identity and directory services, rich data storage and analytics services, machine learning services, media services, web, and mobile backend services, and developer productivity services. to foster a rich developer ecosystem, our digital work  \u00a0 27  table of contents  \u00a0 part ii  item 7  \u00a0  and life experiences will also be extensible, enabling customers and partners to further customize and enhance our solutions, achieving even more value. our strategy requires continuing investment in datacenters and other infrastructure to support our devices and services, and will bring continued competition with google, amazon, and other well-established and emerging competitors.  device operating system and hardware  with our windows device operating system and first-party hardware, we strive to set the standard for productivity experiences. we aim to deliver the richest and most consistent user experience for digital work and life scenarios on screens of all sizes \u0096 from phones, tablets, and laptops to tvs and large, multi-touch displays. we are investing to make windows the most secure, manageable, and capable operating system for the needs of a modern workforce. we are working to create a broad developer opportunity by enabling universal windows applications to run across all device targets. we are developing new input/output methods like speech, pen, and gesture to power more personal computing experiences.  we work with an ecosystem of partners to deliver a broad spectrum of windows devices. we also build first-party hardware to set the standard for productivity experiences and stimulate more demand for the entire windows ecosystem, as we do with surface, and with the acquisition of substantially all nokia corporation\u0092s (\u0093nokia\u0094) devices and services business (\u0093nds\u0094) on april\u00a025, 2014, phones. as consumer services and hardware advance, we expect they will continue to better complement one another, connecting the devices people use daily to unique communications, productivity, and entertainment services from microsoft and our partners and developers. we anticipate many new mobile device categories and we anticipate experiences to emerge that span a variety of devices of all screen sizes. we will invest to be on the forefront of this innovation focusing on dual users and their needs across work and life. with the acquisition of nds, we expect our effective tax rate to increase as our business mix changes.  our future opportunity  there are several distinct areas of technology that we aim to drive forward. our goal is to lead the industry in these areas over the long term, which we expect will translate to sustained growth. we are investing significant resources in:  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 we believe the breadth of our products and services portfolio, our large, global partner and customer base, our growing ecosystem, and our ongoing investment in innovation position us to be a leader in these areas.  economic conditions, challenges, and risks  the market for software, devices, and cloud-based services is dynamic and highly competitive. our competitors are developing new software and devices, while also deploying competing cloud-based services for consumers and businesses. the devices and form factors customers prefer evolve rapidly, and influence how users access services in the cloud and in some cases the user\u0092s choice of which suite of cloud-based services to use. we must continue to evolve and adapt over an extended time in pace with this changing environment. to support our strategy of  \u00a0 28  table of contents  \u00a0 part ii  item 7  \u00a0  reinventing productivity to empower every person and every organization to do more and achieve more, we announced a restructuring plan in july 2014. through this restructuring, we strive to increase agility, streamline engineering processes, move faster and more efficiently, and simplify our organization. even if we achieve these goals, the investments we are making in devices and infrastructure will increase our operating costs and may decrease our operating margins.  we prioritize our investments among the highest long-term growth opportunities. these investments require significant resources and are multi-year in nature. the products and services we bring to market may be developed internally, as part of a partnership or alliance, or through acquisition.  our success is highly dependent on our ability to attract and retain qualified employees. we hire a mix of university and industry talent worldwide. microsoft competes for talented individuals globally by offering an exceptional working environment, broad customer reach, scale in resources, the ability to grow one\u0092s career across many different products and businesses, and competitive compensation and benefits. aggregate demand for our software, services, and devices is correlated to global macroeconomic and geopolitical factors, which remain dynamic. see a discussion of these factors and other risks under risk factors (part i, item\u00a01a of this form 10-k).  unearned revenue  quarterly and annual revenue may be impacted by the deferral of revenue. see the discussions below regarding:  \u00a0 \u00a0 if our customers choose to license cloud-based versions of our products and services rather than licensing transaction-based products and services, the associated revenue will shift from being recognized at the time of the transaction to being recognized over the subscription period or upon consumption, as applicable.  reportable segments  the segment amounts included in md&a are presented on a basis consistent with our internal management reporting. segment information appearing in note 21 \u0096 segment information and geographic data of the notes to financial statements (part ii, item\u00a08 of this form

effective tax rate was lower than the u.s. federal statutory rate primarily due to earnings taxed at lower rates in foreign jurisdictions resulting from producing and distributing our products and services through our foreign regional operations centers in ireland, singapore, and puerto rico.  our fiscal year 2014 effective rate increased by 2% from fiscal year 2013 mainly due to adjustments of $458 million to prior years\u0092 liabilities for intercompany transfer pricing that increased taxable income in more highly taxed jurisdictions, as well as losses incurred by nds and changes in the geographic mix of our business. this was offset in part by favorable transfer pricing developments in certain foreign tax jurisdictions, primarily denmark.  changes in the mix of income before income taxes between the u.s. and foreign countries also impacted our effective tax rates and resulted primarily from changes in the geographic distribution of and changes in consumer demand for our products and services. we supply our windows pc operating system to customers through our u.s. regional operating center, while we supply the microsoft office system and our server products and tools to

2013, respectively, and are included in other long-term liabilities. this increase relates primarily to adjustments to prior years\u0092 liabilities for intercompany transfer pricing and adjustments related to our irs audits. while we settled a portion of the i.r.s. audit for tax years 2004 to 2006 during the third quarter of fiscal year 2011, we remain under audit for those years. in february 2012, the i.r.s. withdrew its 2011 revenue agents report and reopened the audit phase of the examination. as of june\u00a030, 2014, the primary unresolved issue relates to transfer pricing which could have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements if not resolved favorably. we have not received a proposed assessment for the unresolved issues and do not expect a final resolution of these issues in the next 12 months.\u00a0based on the information currently available, we do not anticipate a significant increase or decrease to our tax contingencies for these issues. we also continue to be subject to examination by the i.r.s. for tax years 2007 to 2013.  we are subject to income tax in many jurisdictions outside the u.s. our operations in certain jurisdictions remain subject to examination for tax years 1996 to 2013, some of which are currently under audit by local tax authorities. the resolutions of these audits are not expected to be material to our consolidated financial statements.  \u00a0 39  table of contents  \u00a0 part ii  item 7  \u00a0 fiscal year 2013 compared with fiscal year 2012  our effective tax rate for fiscal years 2013 and 2012 was approximately 19% and 24%, respectively. our effective tax rate was lower than the u.s. federal statutory rate primarily due to earnings taxed at lower rates in foreign jurisdictions resulting from producing and distributing our products and services through our foreign regional operations centers in ireland, singapore, and puerto rico.  our fiscal year 2013 effective rate decreased by 5% from fiscal year 2012 mainly due to a nonrecurring $6.2 billion non-tax deductible goodwill impairment charge that was recorded in fiscal year 2012. the goodwill impairment charge increased our effective tax rate by 10% in fiscal year 2012. in addition, in fiscal years 2013 and 2012, we recognized a reduction of 18% and 21%, respectively, to the effective tax rate due to foreign earnings taxed at lower rates. the decrease in our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2013 was primarily offset by a 1% increase related to the eu fine, which is not tax deductible.  changes in the mix of income before income taxes between the u.s. and foreign countries also impacted our effective tax rates and resulted primarily from changes in the geographic distribution of and changes in consumer demand for our products and services. we supply our windows pc operating system to customers through our u.s. regional operating center, while we supply the microsoft office system and our server products and tools to customers through our foreign regional operations centers. windows pc operating system revenue increased $209 million in fiscal year 2013, while microsoft office system and server products and tools revenue increased $696 million and $1.2 billion, respectively, during this same period. in fiscal years 2013 and 2012, our u.s. income before income taxes was $6.7 billion and $1.6 billion, respectively, and comprised 25% and 7%, respectively, of our income before income taxes. in fiscal years 2013 and 2012, the foreign income before income taxes was $20.4 billion and $20.7 billion, respectively, and comprised 75% and 93%, respectively, of our income before income taxes. the primary driver for the increase in the u.s. income before income tax in fiscal year 2013 was the goodwill impairment charge recorded during the prior year.  tax contingencies and other tax liabilities were $9.4 billion and $7.6 billion as of june\u00a030, 2013 and 2012, respectively, and are included in other long-term liabilities. this increase relates primarily to transfer pricing, including transfer pricing developments in certain foreign tax jurisdictions, primarily denmark. while we settled a portion of the i.r.s. audit for tax years 2004 to 2006 during the third quarter of fiscal year 2011, we remain under audit for those years. in february 2012, the i.r.s. withdrew its 2011 revenue agents report and reopened the audit phase of the examination. as of june\u00a030, 2013, the primary unresolved issue relates to transfer pricing which could have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements if not resolved favorably. we do not believe it is reasonably possible that the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits will significantly increase or decrease within the next 12 months because we do not believe the remaining open issues will be resolved within the next 12 months. we also continue to be subject to examination by the i.r.s. for tax years 2007 to 2012.  we are subject to income tax in many jurisdictions outside the u.s. our operations in certain jurisdictions remain subject to examination for tax years 1996 to 2012, some of which are currently under audit by local tax authorities. the resolutions of these audits are not expected to be material to our consolidated financial statements.  financial condition  cash, cash equivalents, and investments  cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments totaled $85.7 billion as of june\u00a030, 2014, compared with $77.0 billion as of june\u00a030, 2013. equity and other investments were $14.6 billion as of june\u00a030, 2014, compared with $10.8 billion as of june\u00a030, 2013. our short-term investments are primarily to facilitate liquidity and for capital preservation. they consist predominantly of highly liquid investment-grade fixed-income securities, diversified among industries and individual issuers. the investments are predominantly u.s. dollar-denominated securities, but also include foreign currency-denominated securities in order to diversify risk. our fixed-income investments are exposed to interest rate risk and credit risk. the credit risk and average maturity of our fixed-income portfolio are  \u00a0 40  table of contents  \u00a0 part ii  item 7  \u00a0  managed to achieve economic returns that correlate to certain fixed-income indices. the settlement risk related to these investments is insignificant given that the short-term investments held are primarily highly liquid investment-grade fixed-income securities.  of the cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments at june\u00a030, 2014, $77.1 billion was held by our foreign subsidiaries and would be subject to material repatriation tax effects. the amount of cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments held by foreign subsidiaries subject to other restrictions on the free flow of funds (primarily currency and other local regulatory) was $2.6 billion. as of june\u00a030, 2014, approximately 84% of the cash equivalents and short-term investments held by our foreign subsidiaries were invested in u.s. government and agency securities, approximately 5% were invested in corporate notes and bonds of u.s. companies, and approximately 1% were invested in u.s. mortgage-backed securities, all of which are denominated in u.s. dollars.  securities lending  we lend certain fixed-income and equity securities to increase investment returns. the loaned securities continue to be carried as investments on our balance sheet. cash and/or security interests are received as collateral for the loaned securities with the amount determined based upon the underlying security lent and the creditworthiness of the borrower. cash received is recorded as an asset with a corresponding liability. our securities lending payable balance was $558 million as of june\u00a030, 2014. our average and maximum securities lending payable balances for the fiscal year were $619 million and $1.3 billion, respectively. intra-year variances in the amount of securities loaned are mainly due to fluctuations in the demand for the securities.  valuation  in general, and where applicable, we use quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities to determine the fair value of our financial instruments. this pricing methodology applies to our level 1 investments, such as exchange-traded mutual funds, domestic and international equities, and u.s. government securities. if quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities are not available to determine fair value, then we use quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities or inputs other than the quoted prices that are observable either directly or indirectly. this pricing methodology applies to our level 2 investments such as corporate notes and bonds, common and preferred stock, foreign government bonds, mortgage-backed securities, and certificates of deposit. level 3 investments are valued using internally developed models with unobservable inputs. assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis using unobservable inputs are an immaterial portion of our portfolio.  a majority of our investments are priced by pricing vendors and are generally level 1 or level 2 investments as these vendors either provide a quoted market price in an active market or use observable inputs for their pricing without applying significant adjustments. broker pricing is used mainly when a quoted price is not available, the investment is not priced by our pricing vendors, or when a broker price is more reflective of fair values in the market in which the investment trades. our broker-priced investments are generally classified as level 2 investments because the broker prices these investments based on similar assets without applying significant adjustments. in addition, all of our broker-priced investments have a sufficient level of trading volume to demonstrate that the fair values used are appropriate for these investments. our fair value processes include controls that are designed to ensure appropriate fair values are recorded. these controls include model validation, review of key model inputs, analysis of period-over-period fluctuations, and independent recalculation of prices where appropriate.  cash flows  fiscal year 2014 compared with fiscal year 2013  cash flows from operations increased $3.4 billion during the current fiscal year to $32.2 billion, due mainly to increases in cash received from customers. cash used in financing increased $246 million to $8.4 billion, due mainly to a $2.0 billion increase in cash used for common stock repurchases, a $1.4 billion increase in dividends paid, and a $324 million decrease in proceeds from the issuance of common stock, offset in part by a $3.4 billion increase in  \u00a0 41  table of contents  \u00a0 part ii  item 7  \u00a0  proceeds from issuances of debt, net of repayments. cash used in investing decreased $5.0 billion to $18.8 billion, due mainly to a $10.5 billion decrease in cash used for net investment purchases, sales, and maturities, offset in part by a $4.4 billion increase in cash used for acquisition of companies and purchases of intangible and other assets, and a $1.2 billion increase in capital expenditures for property and equipment.  fiscal year 2013 compared with fiscal year 2012  cash flows from operations decreased $2.8 billion during the current fiscal year to $28.8 billion, due mainly to changes in working capital, including increases in inventory and other current assets. cash used for financing decreased $1.3 billion to $8.1 billion, due mainly to a $3.5 billion increase in proceeds from issuances of debt, net of repayments, offset in part by a $1.1 billion increase in dividends paid and a $982 million decrease in proceeds from the issuance of common stock. cash used in investing decreased $975 million to $23.8 billion, due mainly to an $8.5 billion decrease in cash used for acquisitions of companies and purchases of intangible and other assets, offset in part by a $5.8 billion increase in cash used for net investment purchases, maturities, and sales, and a $2.0 billion increase in cash used for additions to property and equipment.  debt  we issued debt to take advantage of favorable pricing and liquidity in the debt markets, reflecting our credit rating and the low interest rate environment. the proceeds of these issuances were or will be used for general corporate purposes, which may include, among other things, funding for working capital, capital expenditures, repurchases of capital stock, acquisitions, and repayment of existing debt.  as of june\u00a030, 2014, we had $22.6 billion of issued and outstanding debt, comprising $2.0 billion of short-term debt and $20.6 billion of long-term debt.  short-term debt  as of june\u00a030, 2014, we had $2.0 billion of commercial paper issued and outstanding, with a weighted-average interest rate of 0.12% and maturities ranging from 86 days to 91 days. the estimated fair value of this commercial paper approximates its carrying value.  we have a $5.0 billion credit facility that expires on november\u00a014, 2018, which serves as a back-up for our commercial paper program. as of june\u00a030, 2014, we were in compliance with the only financial covenant in the credit agreement, which requires us to maintain a coverage ratio of at least three times earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization to interest expense, as defined in the credit agreement. no amounts were drawn against the credit facility during any of the periods presented.  long-term debt  as of june\u00a030, 2014, the total carrying value and estimated fair value of our long-term debt were $20.6 billion and $21.5 billion, respectively. these estimated fair values are based on level\u00a02 inputs.  \u00a0 42  table of contents  \u00a0 part ii  item 7  \u00a0 the components of our long-term debt and the associated interest rates were as follows as of june\u00a030, 2014:  \u00a0 \u00a0 the notes in this table are senior unsecured obligations and rank equally with our other senior unsecured debt outstanding. interest on these notes is paid semi-annually, except for the euro-denominated debt securities on which interest is paid annually. as of june\u00a030, 2014, the aggregate unamortized discount for our long-term debt was $100 million.  unearned revenue  unearned revenue at june\u00a030, 2014 was comprised mainly of unearned revenue from volume licensing programs. unearned revenue from volume licensing programs represents customer billings for multi-year licensing arrangements paid for either at inception of the agreement or annually at the beginning of each coverage period and accounted for as subscriptions with revenue recognized ratably over the coverage period. unearned revenue at june\u00a030, 2014 also included payments for: post-delivery support and consulting services to be performed in the future; xbox live subscriptions and prepaid points; microsoft dynamics business solutions products; office 365 subscriptions; bundled offerings; skype prepaid credits and subscriptions; and other offerings for which we have been paid in advance and earn the revenue when we provide the service or software, or otherwise meet the revenue recognition criteria.  \u00a0 43  table of contents  \u00a0 part ii  item 7  \u00a0 the following table outlines the expected future recognition of unearned revenue as of june\u00a030, 2014:  \u00a0 share repurchases  on september\u00a016, 2013, our board of directors approved a new share repurchase program authorizing up to $40.0 billion in share repurchases. the share repurchase program became effective on october\u00a01, 2013, has no expiration date, and may be suspended or discontinued at any time without notice. as of june\u00a030, 2014, $35.1 billion remained of the $40.0 billion share repurchase program.  during fiscal year 2014, we repurchased 175\u00a0million shares of microsoft common stock for $6.4 billion; 128\u00a0million shares were repurchased for $4.9 billion under the share repurchase program approved by our board of directors on september\u00a016, 2013 and 47\u00a0million shares were repurchased for $1.5 billion under the share repurchase program that was announced on september\u00a022, 2008 and expired september\u00a030, 2013. during fiscal years 2013 and 2012, we repurchased 158\u00a0million shares for $4.6 billion and 142\u00a0million shares for $4.0 billion, respectively, under the share repurchase program announced on september\u00a022, 2008. all repurchases were made using cash resources.  dividends  during fiscal years 2014 and 2013, our board of directors declared the following dividends:  \u00a0 off-balance sheet arrangements  we provide indemnifications of varying scope and size to certain customers against claims of intellectual property infringement made by third parties arising from the use of our products and certain other matters. in evaluating estimated losses on these indemnifications, we consider factors such as the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and our ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss. these obligations did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements during the periods presented.  \u00a0 44  table of contents  \u00a0 part ii  item 7  \u00a0 contractual obligations  the following table summarizes the payments due by fiscal year for our outstanding contractual obligations as of june\u00a030, 2014:  \u00a0 \u00a0 other planned uses of capital  we will continue to invest in sales, marketing, product support infrastructure, and existing and advanced areas of technology. additions to property and equipment will continue, including new facilities, data centers, and computer systems for research and development, sales and marketing, support, and administrative staff. we expect capital expenditures to increase in coming years in support of our cloud and devices strategy. we have operating leases for most u.s. and international sales and support offices and certain equipment. we have not engaged in any related party transactions or arrangements with unconsolidated entities or other persons that are reasonably likely to materially affect liquidity or the availability of capital resources.  liquidity  we earn a significant amount of our operating income outside the u.s., which is deemed to be permanently reinvested in foreign jurisdictions. as a result, as discussed above under cash, cash equivalents, and investments, the majority of our cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments are held by foreign subsidiaries. we currently do not intend nor foresee a need to repatriate these funds. we expect existing domestic cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, and cash flows from operations to continue to be sufficient to fund our domestic operating activities and cash commitments for investing and financing activities, such as regular quarterly dividends, debt repayment schedules, and material capital expenditures, for at least the next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future. in addition, we expect existing foreign cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, and cash flows from operations to continue to be sufficient to fund our foreign operating activities and cash commitments for investing activities, such as material capital expenditures, for at least the next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future.  should we require more capital in the u.s. than is generated by our operations domestically, for example to fund significant discretionary activities, such as business acquisitions and share repurchases, we could elect to repatriate future earnings from foreign jurisdictions or raise capital in the u.s. through debt or equity issuances. these alternatives could result in higher effective tax rates, increased interest expense, or dilution of our earnings. we have borrowed funds domestically and continue to believe we have the ability to do so at reasonable interest rates.  \u00a0 45  table of contents  \u00a0 part ii  item 7  \u00a0 recent accounting guidance  recently adopted accounting guidance  in december 2011, the financial accounting standards board (\u0093fasb\u0094) issued guidance enhancing disclosure requirements about the nature of an entity\u0092s right to offset and related arrangements associated with its financial instruments. the new guidance requires the disclosure of the gross amounts subject to rights of set-off, amounts offset in accordance with the accounting standards followed, and the related net exposure. in january 2013, the fasb clarified that the scope of this guidance applies to derivatives, repurchase agreements, and securities lending arrangements that are either offset or subject to an enforceable master netting arrangement, or similar agreements. we adopted this new guidance beginning july\u00a01, 2013. adoption of this new guidance resulted only in changes to the presentation of note 5 \u0096 derivatives of the notes to financial statements.  in february 2013, the fasb issued guidance on disclosure requirements for items reclassified out of aoci. this new guidance requires entities to present (either on the face of the income statement or in the notes to financial statements) the effects on the line items of the income statement for amounts reclassified out of aoci. we adopted this new guidance beginning july\u00a01, 2013. adoption of this new guidance resulted only in changes to the presentation of note 19 \u0096 accumulated other comprehensive income of the notes to financial statements.  recent accounting guidance not yet adopted  in march 2013, the fasb issued guidance on a parent\u0092s accounting for the cumulative translation adjustment upon derecognition of a subsidiary or group of assets within a foreign entity. this new guidance requires that the parent release any related cumulative translation adjustment into net income only if the sale or transfer results in the complete or substantially complete liquidation of the foreign entity in which the subsidiary or group of assets had resided. the new guidance will be effective for us beginning july\u00a01, 2014. we do not anticipate material impacts on our consolidated financial statements upon adoption.  in may 2014, as part of its ongoing efforts to assist in the convergence of u.s. gaap and international financial reporting standards, the fasb issued a new standard related to revenue recognition. under the new standard, recognition of revenue occurs when a customer obtains control of promised goods or services in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. in addition, the standard requires disclosure of the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. the new standard will be effective for us beginning july\u00a01, 2017 and early adoption is not permitted. we anticipate this standard will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements, and we are currently evaluating its impact.  application of critical accounting policies  our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with u.s. gaap. preparing consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. these estimates and assumptions are affected by management\u0092s application of accounting policies. critical accounting policies for us include revenue recognition, impairment of investment securities, goodwill, research and development costs, contingencies, income taxes, and inventories.  revenue recognition  revenue recognition for multiple-element arrangements requires judgment to determine if multiple elements exist, whether elements can be accounted for as separate units of accounting, and if so, the fair value for each of the elements.  judgment is also required to assess whether future releases of certain software represent new products or upgrades and enhancements to existing products. certain volume licensing arrangements include a perpetual license for  \u00a0 46  table of contents  \u00a0 part ii  item 7  \u00a0  current products combined with rights to receive unspecified future versions of software products (\u0093software assurance\u0094) and are accounted for as subscriptions, with billings recorded as unearned revenue and recognized as revenue ratably over the coverage period.  software updates are evaluated on a case-by-case basis to determine whether they meet the definition of an upgrade, which may require revenue to be deferred and recognized when the upgrade is delivered. if it is determined that implied post-contract customer support (\u0093pcs\u0094) is being provided, revenue from the arrangement is deferred and recognized over the implied pcs term. if updates are determined to not meet the definition of an upgrade, revenue is generally recognized as products are shipped or made available.  microsoft enters into arrangements that can include various combinations of software, services, and hardware. where elements are delivered over different periods of time, and when allowed under u.s. gaap, revenue is allocated to the respective elements based on their relative selling prices at the inception of the arrangement, and revenue is recognized as each element is delivered. we use a hierarchy to determine the fair value to be used for allocating revenue to elements: (i)\u00a0vendor-specific objective evidence of fair value (\u0093vsoe\u0094), (ii)\u00a0third-party evidence, and (iii)\u00a0best estimate of selling price (\u0093esp\u0094). for software elements, we follow the industry specific software guidance which only allows for the use of vsoe in establishing fair value. generally, vsoe is the price charged when the deliverable is sold separately or the price established by management for a product that is not yet sold if it is probable that the price will not change before introduction into the marketplace. esps are established as best estimates of what the selling prices would be if the deliverables were sold regularly on a stand-alone basis. our process for determining esps requires judgment and considers multiple factors that may vary over time depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each deliverable.  windows 7 revenue was subject to deferral as a result of the windows upgrade offer, which started june\u00a02, 2012. the offer provided significantly discounted rights to purchase windows 8 pro to qualifying end-users that purchased windows 7 pcs during the eligibility period. microsoft was responsible for delivering windows 8 pro to the end customer. accordingly, revenue related to the allocated discount for undelivered windows 8 was deferred until it was delivered or the redemption period expired.  impairment of investment securities  we review investments quarterly for indicators of other-than-temporary impairment. this determination requires significant judgment. in making this judgment, we employ a systematic methodology quarterly that considers available quantitative and qualitative evidence in evaluating potential impairment of our investments. if the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value, we evaluate, among other factors, general market conditions, credit quality of debt instrument issuers, the duration and extent to which the fair value is less than cost, and for equity securities, our intent and ability to hold, or plans to sell, the investment. for fixed-income securities, we also evaluate whether we have plans to sell the security or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery. we also consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of and business outlook for the investee, including industry and sector performance, changes in technology, and operational and financing cash flow factors. once a decline in fair value is determined to be other-than-temporary, an impairment charge is recorded to other income (expense) and a new cost basis in the investment is established. if market, industry, and/or investee conditions deteriorate, we may incur future impairments.  goodwill  we allocate goodwill to reporting units based on the reporting unit expected to benefit from the business combination. we evaluate our reporting units on an annual basis and, if necessary, reassign goodwill using a relative fair value allocation approach. goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level (operating segment or one level below an operating segment) on an annual basis (may 1 for us) and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. these events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate, legal factors, operating performance indicators, competition, or sale or disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit.  \u00a0 47  table of contents  \u00a0 part ii  item 7  \u00a0 application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment, including the identification of reporting units, assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units, assignment of goodwill to reporting units, and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit. the fair value of each reporting unit is estimated primarily through the use of a discounted cash flow methodology. this analysis requires significant judgments, including estimation of future cash flows, which is dependent on internal forecasts, estimation of the long-term rate of growth for our business, estimation of the useful life over which cash flows will occur, and determination of our weighted average cost of capital.  the estimates used to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit change from year to year based on operating results, market conditions, and other factors. changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and goodwill impairment for each reporting unit.  the valuation of acquired assets and liabilities, including goodwill, resulting from the acquisition of nds, is reflective of the enterprise value based on the long-term financial forecast for the business.\u00a0in this highly competitive and volatile market, it is possible that we may not realize our forecasts. given the value assigned to goodwill in the purchase price allocation, we will closely monitor the performance of the business versus the long-term forecast to determine if any impairments arise.  research and development costs  costs incurred internally in researching and developing a computer software product are charged to expense until technological feasibility has been established for the product. once technological feasibility is established, all software costs are capitalized until the product is available for general release to customers. judgment is required in determining when technological feasibility of a product is established. we have determined that technological feasibility for our software products is reached after all high-risk development issues have been resolved through coding and testing. generally, this occurs shortly before the products are released to manufacturing. the amortization of these costs is included in cost of revenue over the estimated life of the products.  legal and other contingencies  the outcomes of legal proceedings and claims brought against us are subject to significant uncertainty. an estimated loss from a loss contingency such as a legal proceeding or claim is accrued by a charge to income if it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. in determining whether a loss should be accrued we evaluate, among other factors, the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss. changes in these factors could materially impact our consolidated financial statements.  income taxes  the objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entity\u0092s financial statements or tax returns. we recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. accounting literature also provides guidance on derecognition of income tax assets and liabilities, classification of current and deferred income tax assets and liabilities, accounting for interest and penalties associated with tax positions, and income tax disclosures. judgment is required in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements or tax returns. variations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could materially impact our consolidated financial statements.  inventories  inventories are stated at average cost, subject to the lower of cost or market. cost includes materials, labor, and manufacturing overhead related to the purchase and production of inventories. we regularly review inventory  \u00a0 48  table of contents  \u00a0 part ii  item 7  \u00a0  quantities on hand, future purchase commitments with our suppliers, and the estimated utility of our inventory. these reviews include analysis of demand forecasts, product life cycle status, product development plans, current sales levels, pricing strategy, and component cost trends. if our review indicates a reduction in utility below carrying value, we reduce our inventory to a new cost basis through a charge to cost of revenue. the determination of market value and the estimated volume of demand used in the lower of cost or market analysis require significant judgment.  \u00a0 49  table of contents  \u00a0 part ii  item 7  \u00a0 statement of management\u0092s responsibility for financial statements  management is responsible for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements and related information that are presented in this report. the consolidated financial statements, which include amounts based on management\u0092s estimates and judgments, have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america.  the company designs and maintains accounting and internal control systems to provide reasonable assurance at reasonable cost that assets are safeguarded against loss from unauthorized use or disposition, and that the financial records are reliable for preparing consolidated financial statements and maintaining accountability for assets. these systems are augmented by written policies, an organizational structure providing division of responsibilities, careful selection and training of qualified personnel, and a program of internal audits.  the company engaged deloitte\u00a0& touche llp, an independent registered public accounting firm, to audit and render an opinion on the consolidated financial statements and internal control over financial reporting in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board (united states).  the board of directors, through its audit committee, consisting solely of independent directors of the company, meets periodically with management, internal auditors, and our independent registered public accounting firm to ensure that each is meeting its responsibilities and to discuss matters concerning internal controls and financial reporting. deloitte\u00a0& touche llp and the internal auditors each have full and free access to the audit committee.  \u00a0 \u00a0 50  table of contents  \u00a0 part ii  item 7a  \u00a0 item\u00a07a.\u00a0quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk  risks  we are exposed to economic risk from foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, credit risk, equity prices, and commodity prices. a portion of these risks is hedged, but they may impact our consolidated financial statements.  foreign currency  certain forecasted transactions, assets, and liabilities are exposed to foreign currency risk. we monitor our foreign currency exposures daily and use hedges where practicable to offset the risks and maximize the economic effectiveness of our foreign currency positions. principal currencies hedged include the euro, japanese yen, british pound, and canadian dollar.  interest rate  our fixed-income portfolio is diversified across credit sectors and maturities, consisting primarily of investment-grade securities. the credit risk and average maturity of the fixed-income portfolio is managed to achieve economic returns that correlate to certain global and domestic fixed-income indices. in addition, we use \u0093to be announced\u0094 forward purchase commitments of mortgage-backed assets to gain exposure to agency and mortgage-backed securities.  equity  our equity portfolio consists of global, developed, and emerging market securities that are subject to market price risk.\u00a0we manage the securities relative to certain global and domestic indices and expect their economic risk and return to correlate with these indices.  commodity  we use broad-based commodity exposures to enhance portfolio returns and facilitate portfolio diversification. our investment portfolio has exposure to a variety of commodities, including precious metals, energy, and grain. we manage these exposures relative to global commodity indices and expect their economic risk and return to correlate with these indices.  value-at-risk  we use a value-at-risk (\u0093var\u0094) model to estimate and quantify our market risks. var is the expected loss, for a given confidence level, in the fair value of our portfolio due to adverse market movements over a defined time horizon. the var model is not intended to represent actual losses in fair value, including determinations of other-than-temporary losses in fair value in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states (\u0093u.s. gaap\u0094), but is used as a risk estimation and management tool. the distribution of the potential changes in total market value of all holdings is computed based on the historical volatilities and correlations among foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, equity prices, and commodity prices, assuming normal market conditions.  the var is calculated as the total loss that will not be exceeded at the 97.5 percentile confidence level or, alternatively stated, the losses could exceed the var in 25 out of 1,000 cases. several risk factors are not captured in the model, including liquidity risk, operational risk, and legal risk.  \u00a0 51  table of contents  \u00a0 part ii  item 7a  \u00a0 the following table sets forth the one-day var for substantially all of our positions as of june\u00a030, 2014 and 2013 and for the year ended june\u00a030, 2014:  \u00a0 total one-day var for the combined risk categories was $333 million at june\u00a030, 2014 and $350 million at june\u00a030, 2013. the total var is 25% less at june\u00a030, 2014, and 28% less at june\u00a030, 2013, than the sum of the separate risk categories in the table above due to the diversification benefit of the combination of risks.  \u00a0 52  table of contents  \u00a0 part ii  item 8  \u00a0 comprehensive income statements  \u00a0 see accompanying notes.  \u00a0 54  table of contents  \u00a0 part ii  item 8  \u00a0 stockholders\u0092 equity statements  \u00a0 see accompanying notes.  \u00a0 57  table of contents  \u00a0 part ii  item 8  \u00a0 notes to financial statements  note 1 - accounting policies  accounting principles  the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america (\u0093u.s. gaap\u0094).  principles of consolidation  the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of microsoft corporation and its subsidiaries. intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated. equity investments through which we are able to exercise significant influence over but do not control the investee and are not the primary beneficiary of the investee\u0092s activities are accounted for using the equity method. investments through which we are not able to exercise significant influence over the investee and which do not have readily determinable fair values are accounted for under the cost method.  estimates and assumptions  preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. examples of estimates include: loss contingencies; product warranties; the fair value of, and/or potential goodwill impairment for, our reporting units; product life cycles; useful lives of our tangible and intangible assets; allowances for doubtful accounts; allowances for product returns; the market value of our inventory; and stock-based compensation forfeiture rates. examples of assumptions include: the elements comprising a software arrangement, including the distinction between upgrades or enhancements and new products; when technological feasibility is achieved for our products; the potential outcome of future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements or tax returns; and determining when investment impairments are other-than-temporary. actual results and outcomes may differ from management\u0092s estimates and assumptions.  recasting of certain prior period information  during the first quarter of fiscal year 2014, we changed our organizational structure as part of our transformation to a devices and services company. as a result, information that our chief operating decision maker regularly reviews for purposes of allocating resources and assessing performance changed. therefore, beginning in fiscal year 2014, we reported our financial performance based on our new segments described in note 21 \u0096 segment information and geographic data. we have recast certain prior period amounts to conform to the way we internally managed and monitored segment performance during fiscal year 2014. this change impacted note 10 \u0096 goodwill, note 14 \u0096 unearned revenue, and note 21 \u0096 segment information and geographic data, with no impact on our consolidated financial statements.  foreign currencies  assets and liabilities recorded in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rate on the balance sheet date. revenue and expenses are translated at average rates of exchange prevailing during the year. translation adjustments resulting from this process are recorded to other comprehensive income (\u0093oci\u0094).  revenue recognition  revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the fee is fixed or determinable, and collectability is probable. revenue generally is recognized net of allowances for returns and any taxes collected from customers and subsequently remitted to governmental authorities.  \u00a0 58  table of contents  \u00a0 part ii  item 8  \u00a0 revenue recognition for multiple-element arrangements requires judgment to determine if multiple elements exist, whether elements can be accounted for as separate units of accounting, and if so, the fair value for each of the elements.  microsoft enters into arrangements that can include various combinations of software, services, and hardware. where elements are delivered over different periods of time, and when allowed under u.s. gaap, revenue is allocated to the respective elements based on their relative selling prices at the inception of the arrangement, and revenue is recognized as each element is delivered. we use a hierarchy to determine the fair value to be used for allocating revenue to elements: (i)\u00a0vendor-specific objective evidence of fair value (\u0093vsoe\u0094), (ii)\u00a0third-party evidence, and (iii)\u00a0best estimate of selling price (\u0093esp\u0094). for software elements, we follow the industry specific software guidance which only allows for the use of vsoe in establishing fair value. generally, vsoe is the price charged when the deliverable is sold separately or the price established by management for a product that is not yet sold if it is probable that the price will not change before introduction into the marketplace. esps are established as best estimates of what the selling prices would be if the deliverables were sold regularly on a stand-alone basis. our process for determining esps requires judgment and considers multiple factors that may vary over time depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each deliverable.  revenue for retail packaged products, products licensed to original equipment manufacturers (\u0093oems\u0094), and perpetual licenses under certain volume licensing programs generally is recognized as products are shipped or made available.  technology guarantee programs are accounted for as multiple-element arrangements as customers receive free or significantly discounted rights to use upcoming new versions of a software product if they license existing versions of the product during the eligibility period. revenue is allocated between the existing product and the new product, and revenue allocated to the new product is deferred until that version is delivered. the revenue allocation is based on the vsoe of fair value of the products. the vsoe of fair value for upcoming new products are based on the price determined by management having the relevant authority when the element is not yet sold separately, but is expected to be sold in the near future at the price set by management.  software updates that will be provided free of charge are evaluated on a case-by-case basis to determine whether they meet the definition of an upgrade and create a multiple-element arrangement, which may require revenue to be deferred and recognized when the upgrade is delivered, or if it is determined that implied post-contract customer support (\u0093pcs\u0094) is being provided, the arrangement is accounted for as a multiple-element arrangement and all revenue from the arrangement is deferred and recognized over the implied pcs term when the vsoe of fair value does not exist. if updates are determined to not meet the definition of an upgrade, revenue is generally recognized as products are shipped or made available.  certain volume licensing arrangements include a perpetual license for current products combined with rights to receive unspecified future versions of software products (\u0093software assurance\u0094), which we have determined are additional software products and are therefore accounted for as subscriptions, with billings recorded as unearned revenue and recognized as revenue ratably over the coverage period. arrangements that include term-based licenses for current products with the right to use unspecified future versions of the software during the coverage period, are also accounted for as subscriptions, with revenue recognized ratably over the coverage period.  revenue from cloud-based services arrangements that allow for the use of a hosted software product or service over a contractually determined period of time without taking possession of software are accounted for as subscriptions with billings recorded as unearned revenue and recognized as revenue ratably over the coverage period beginning on the date the service is made available to customers. revenue from cloud-based services arrangements that are provided on a consumption basis (for example, the amount of storage used in a particular period) is recognized commensurate with the customer utilization of such resources.  some volume licensing arrangements include time-based subscriptions for cloud-based services and software offerings that are accounted for as subscriptions. these arrangements are considered multiple-element arrangements. however, because all elements are accounted for as subscriptions and have the same coverage period and delivery pattern, they have the same revenue recognition timing.  \u00a0 59  table of contents  \u00a0 part ii  item 8  \u00a0 revenue related to phones, surface, xbox consoles, games published by us, and other hardware components is generally recognized when ownership is transferred to the resellers or to end customers when selling directly through microsoft retail stores and online marketplaces. a portion of revenue may be deferred when these products are combined with software elements, and/or services. revenue related to licensing for games published by third parties for use on the xbox consoles is recognized when games are manufactured by the game publishers.  display advertising revenue is recognized as advertisements are displayed. search advertising revenue is recognized when the ad appears in the search results or when the action necessary to earn the revenue has been completed. consulting services revenue is recognized as services are rendered, generally based on the negotiated hourly rate in the consulting arrangement and the number of hours worked during the period. consulting revenue for fixed-price services arrangements is recognized as services are provided. revenue from prepaid points redeemable for the purchase of software or services is recognized upon redemption of the points and delivery of the software or services.  cost of revenue  cost of revenue includes: manufacturing and distribution costs for products sold and programs licensed; operating costs related to product support service centers and product distribution centers; costs incurred to include software on pcs sold by oems, to drive traffic to our websites, and to acquire online advertising space (\u0093traffic acquisition costs\u0094); costs incurred to support and maintain internet-based products and services, including datacenter costs and royalties; warranty costs; inventory valuation adjustments; costs associated with the delivery of consulting services; and the amortization of capitalized research and development costs. capitalized research and development costs are amortized over the estimated lives of the products.  product warranty  we provide for the estimated costs of fulfilling our obligations under hardware and software warranties at the time the related revenue is recognized. for hardware warranties, we estimate the costs based on historical and projected product failure rates, historical and projected repair costs, and knowledge of specific product failures (if any). the specific hardware warranty terms and conditions vary depending upon the product sold and the country in which we do business, but generally include parts and labor over a period generally ranging from 90\u00a0days to three years. for software warranties, we estimate the costs to provide bug fixes, such as security patches, over the estimated life of the software. we regularly reevaluate our estimates to assess the adequacy of the recorded warranty liabilities and adjust the amounts as necessary.  research and development  research and development expenses include payroll, employee benefits, stock-based compensation expense, and other headcount-related expenses associated with product development. research and development expenses also include third-party development and programming costs, localization costs incurred to translate software for international markets, and the amortization of purchased software code and services content. such costs related to software development are included in research and development expense until the point that technological feasibility is reached, which for our software products, is generally shortly before the products are released to manufacturing. once technological feasibility is reached, such costs are capitalized and amortized to cost of revenue over the estimated lives of the products.  sales and marketing  sales and marketing expenses include payroll, employee benefits, stock-based compensation expense, and other headcount-related expenses associated with sales and marketing personnel, and the costs of advertising, promotions, trade shows, seminars, and other programs. advertising costs are expensed as incurred. advertising expense was $2.3 billion, $2.6 billion, and $1.6 billion in fiscal years 2014, 2013, and 2012, respectively.  \u00a0 60  table of contents  \u00a0 part ii  item 8  \u00a0 stock-based compensation  we measure stock-based compensation cost at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and recognize it as expense, net of estimated forfeitures, over the vesting or service period, as applicable, of the stock award (generally four to five years) using the straight-line method.  employee stock purchase plan  shares of our common stock may be purchased by employees at three-month intervals at 90% of the fair market value of the stock on the last day of each three-month period. compensation expense for the employee stock purchase plan is measured as the discount the employee is entitled to upon purchase and is recognized in the period of purchase.  income taxes  income tax expense includes u.s. and international income taxes, the provision for u.s. taxes on undistributed earnings of international subsidiaries not deemed to be permanently invested, and interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions. certain income and expenses are not reported in tax returns and financial statements in the same year. the tax effect of such temporary differences is reported as deferred income taxes. deferred tax assets are reported net of a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized. the deferred income taxes are classified as current or long-term based on the classification of the related asset or liability.  fair value measurements  we account for certain assets and liabilities at fair value. the hierarchy below lists three levels of fair value based on the extent to which inputs used in measuring fair value are observable in the market.\u00a0we categorize each of our fair value measurements in one of these three levels based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. these levels are:  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 we measure certain assets, including our cost and equity method investments, at fair value on a nonrecurring basis when they are deemed to be other-than-temporarily impaired. the fair values of these investments are determined  \u00a0 61  table of contents  \u00a0 part ii  item 8  \u00a0  based on valuation techniques using the best information available, and may include quoted market prices, market comparables, and discounted cash flow projections. an impairment charge is recorded when the cost of the investment exceeds its fair value and this condition is determined to be other-than-temporary.  our other current financial assets and our current financial liabilities have fair values that approximate their carrying values.  financial instruments  we consider all highly liquid interest-earning investments with a maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase to be cash equivalents. the fair values of these investments approximate their carrying values. in general, investments with original maturities of greater than three months and remaining maturities of less than one year are classified as short-term investments. investments with maturities beyond one year may be classified as short-term based on their highly liquid nature and because such marketable securities represent the investment of cash that is available for current operations. all cash equivalents and short-term investments are classified as available-for-sale and realized gains and losses are recorded using the specific identification method. changes in market value, excluding other-than-temporary impairments, are reflected in oci.  equity and other investments classified as long-term include both debt and equity instruments. with the exception of certain corporate notes that are classified as held-to-maturity, debt and publicly-traded equity securities are classified as available-for-sale and realized gains and losses are recorded using the specific identification method. changes in the market value of available-for-sale securities, excluding other-than-temporary impairments, are reflected in oci. held-to-maturity investments are recorded and held at amortized cost. common and preferred stock and other investments that are restricted for more than one year or are not publicly traded are recorded at cost or using the equity method.  we lend certain fixed-income and equity securities to increase investment returns. the loaned securities continue to be carried as investments on our balance sheet. cash and/or security interests are received as collateral for the loaned securities with the amount determined based upon the underlying security lent and the creditworthiness of the borrower. cash received is recorded as an asset with a corresponding liability.  investments are considered to be impaired when a decline in fair value is judged to be other-than-temporary. fair value is calculated based on publicly available market information or other estimates determined by management. we employ a systematic methodology on a quarterly basis that considers available quantitative and qualitative evidence in evaluating potential impairment of our investments. if the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value, we evaluate, among other factors, general market conditions, credit quality of debt instrument issuers, the duration and extent to which the fair value is less than cost, and for equity securities, our intent and ability to hold, or plans to sell, the investment. for fixed-income securities, we also evaluate whether we have plans to sell the security or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery. we also consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of and business outlook for the investee, including industry and sector performance, changes in technology, and operational and financing cash flow factors. once a decline in fair value is determined to be other-than-temporary, an impairment charge is recorded to other income (expense) and a new cost basis in the investment is established.  derivative instruments are recognized as either assets or liabilities and are measured at fair value. the accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation.  for derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges, the gains (losses) are recognized in earnings in the periods of change together with the offsetting losses (gains) on the hedged items attributed to the risk being hedged. for options designated as fair value hedges, changes in the time value are excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and are recognized in earnings.  for derivative instruments designated as cash-flow hedges, the effective portion of the gains (losses) on the derivatives is initially reported as a component of oci and is subsequently recognized in earnings when the hedged  \u00a0 62  table of contents  \u00a0 part ii  item 8  \u00a0  exposure is recognized in earnings. for options designated as cash-flow hedges, changes in the time value are excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and are recognized in earnings. gains (losses) on derivatives representing either hedge components excluded from the assessment of effectiveness or hedge ineffectiveness are recognized in earnings.  for derivative instruments that are not designated as hedges, gains (losses) from changes in fair values are primarily recognized in other income (expense). other than those derivatives entered into for investment purposes, such as commodity contracts, the gains (losses) are generally economically offset by unrealized gains (losses) in the underlying available-for-sale securities, which are recorded as a component of oci until the securities are sold or other-than-temporarily impaired, at which time the amounts are reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income (\u0093aoci\u0094) into other income (expense).  allowance for doubtful accounts  the allowance for doubtful accounts reflects our best estimate of probable losses inherent in the accounts receivable balance. we determine the allowance based on known troubled accounts, historical experience, and other currently available evidence. activity in the allowance for doubtful accounts was as follows:  \u00a0 inventories  inventories are stated at average cost, subject to the lower of cost or market. cost includes materials, labor, and manufacturing overhead related to the purchase and production of inventories. we regularly review inventory quantities on hand, future purchase commitments with our suppliers, and the estimated utility of our inventory. if our review indicates a reduction in utility below carrying value, we reduce our inventory to a new cost basis through a charge to cost of revenue. the determination of market value and the estimated volume of demand used in the lower of cost or market analysis require significant judgment.  property and equipment  property and equipment is stated at cost and depreciated using the straight-line method over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the asset or the lease term. the estimated useful lives of our property and equipment are generally as follows: computer software developed or acquired for internal use, three to seven years; computer equipment, two to three years; buildings and improvements, five to 15 years; leasehold improvements, two to 20 years; and furniture and equipment, one to 10 years. land is not depreciated.  goodwill  goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level (operating segment or one level below an operating segment) on an annual basis (may 1 for us) and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value.  intangible assets  all of our intangible assets are subject to amortization and are amortized using the straight-line method over their estimated period of benefit, ranging from one to 15 years. we evaluate the recoverability of intangible assets periodically by taking into account events or circumstances that may warrant revised estimates of useful lives or that indicate the asset may be impaired.  \u00a0 63  table of contents  \u00a0 part ii  item 8  \u00a0 recent accounting guidance  recently adopted accounting guidance  in december 2011, the financial accounting standards board (\u0093fasb\u0094) issued guidance enhancing disclosure requirements about the nature of an entity\u0092s right to offset and related arrangements associated with its financial instruments. the new guidance requires the disclosure of the gross amounts subject to rights of set-off, amounts offset in accordance with the accounting standards followed, and the related net exposure. in january 2013, the fasb clarified that the scope of this guidance applies to derivatives, repurchase agreements, and securities lending arrangements that are either offset or subject to an enforceable master netting arrangement, or similar agreements. we adopted this new guidance beginning july\u00a01, 2013. adoption of this new guidance resulted only in changes to the presentation of note 5 \u0096 derivatives.  in february 2013, the fasb issued guidance on disclosure requirements for items reclassified out of aoci. this new guidance requires entities to present (either on the face of the income statement or in the notes to financial statements) the effects on the line items of the income statement for amounts reclassified out of aoci. we adopted this new guidance beginning july\u00a01, 2013. adoption of this new guidance resulted only in changes to the presentation of note 19 \u0096 accumulated other comprehensive income.  recent accounting guidance not yet adopted  in march 2013, the fasb issued guidance on a parent\u0092s accounting for the cumulative translation adjustment upon derecognition of a subsidiary or group of assets within a foreign entity. this new guidance requires that the parent release any related cumulative translation adjustment into net income only if the sale or transfer results in the complete or substantially complete liquidation of the foreign entity in which the subsidiary or group of assets had resided. the new guidance will be effective for us beginning july\u00a01, 2014. we do not anticipate material impacts on our consolidated financial statements upon adoption.  in may 2014, as part of its ongoing efforts to assist in the convergence of u.s. gaap and international financial reporting standards, the fasb issued a new standard related to revenue recognition. under the new standard, recognition of revenue occurs when a customer obtains control of promised goods or services in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. in addition, the standard requires disclosure of the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. the new standard will be effective for us beginning july\u00a01, 2017 and early adoption is not permitted. we anticipate this standard will have a material impact, and we are currently evaluating the impact this standard will have on our consolidated financial statements.  note 2 - earnings per share  basic earnings per share (\u0093eps\u0094) is computed based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. diluted eps is computed based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock plus the effect of dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period using the treasury stock method. dilutive potential common shares include outstanding stock options and stock awards.  \u00a0 64  table of contents  \u00a0 part ii  item 8  \u00a0 the components of basic and diluted eps are as follows:  \u00a0 anti-dilutive stock-based awards excluded from the calculations of diluted eps were immaterial during the periods presented.  note 3 - other income (expense)  the components of other income (expense) were as follows:  \u00a0 following are details of net recognized gains (losses) on investments during the periods reported:  \u00a0 \u00a0 65  table of contents  \u00a0 part ii  item 8  \u00a0 note 4 - investments  investment components  the components of investments, including associated derivatives, but excluding held-to-maturity investments, were as follows:  \u00a0 \u00a0 in addition to the investments in the table above, we also own corporate notes that were purchased in connection with our agreement to lend $2.0 billion to the group that completed their acquisition of dell on october\u00a029, 2013. these corporate notes are classified as held-to-maturity investments and are included in equity and other investments on the balance sheet.\u00a0as of june\u00a030, 2014, the amortized cost, recorded basis, and estimated fair value of these corporate notes was $1.5 billion, $1.5 billion, and $1.7 billion, respectively, while their associated gross unrecognized holding gains were $164 million.  as of june\u00a030, 2014 and 2013, the recorded bases of common and preferred stock that are restricted for more than one year or are not publicly traded were $520 million and $395 million, respectively. these investments are carried at cost and are reviewed quarterly for indicators of other-than-temporary impairment. it is not practicable for us to reliably estimate the fair value of these investments.  \u00a0 66  table of contents  \u00a0 part ii  item 8  \u00a0 unrealized losses on investments  investments, excluding those held-to-maturity, with continuous unrealized losses for less than 12 months and 12 months or greater and their related fair values were as follows:  \u00a0 \u00a0 as of june\u00a030, 2014, we did not hold any held-to-maturity investments that are in an unrealized loss position.  unrealized losses from fixed-income securities are primarily attributable to changes in interest rates. unrealized losses from domestic and international equities are due to market price movements. management does not believe any remaining unrealized losses represent other-than-temporary impairments based on our evaluation of available evidence as of june\u00a030, 2014.  debt investment maturities  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 67  table of contents  \u00a0 part ii  item 8  \u00a0 note 5 - derivatives  we use derivative instruments to manage risks related to foreign currencies, equity prices, interest rates, and credit; to enhance investment returns; and to facilitate portfolio diversification. our objectives for holding derivatives include reducing, eliminating, and efficiently managing the economic impact of these exposures as effectively as possible. our derivative programs include strategies that both qualify and do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment. all notional amounts presented below are measured in u.s. dollar equivalents.  foreign currency  certain forecasted transactions, assets, and liabilities are exposed to foreign currency risk. we monitor our foreign currency exposures daily to maximize the economic effectiveness of our foreign currency hedge positions. option and forward contracts are used to hedge a portion of forecasted international revenue for up to three years in the future and are designated as cash flow hedging instruments. principal currencies hedged include the euro, japanese yen, british pound, and canadian dollar. as of june\u00a030, 2014 and june\u00a030, 2013, the total notional amounts of these foreign exchange contracts sold were $4.9 billion and $5.1 billion, respectively.  foreign currency risks related to certain non-u.s. dollar denominated securities are hedged using foreign exchange forward contracts that are designated as fair value hedging instruments. as of june\u00a030, 2014 and june\u00a030, 2013, the total notional amounts of these foreign exchange contracts sold were $3.1 billion and $407 million, respectively.  certain options and forwards not designated as hedging instruments are also used to manage the variability in exchange rates on accounts receivable, cash, and intercompany positions, and to manage other foreign currency exposures.\u00a0as of june\u00a030, 2014, the total notional amounts of these foreign exchange contracts purchased and sold were $6.2 billion and $8.5 billion, respectively. as of june\u00a030, 2013, the total notional amounts of these foreign exchange contracts purchased and sold were $5.0 billion and $7.9 billion, respectively.  equity  securities held in our equity and other investments portfolio are subject to market price risk.\u00a0market price risk is managed relative to broad-based global and domestic equity indices using certain convertible preferred investments, options, futures, and swap contracts not designated as hedging instruments. from time to time, to hedge our price risk, we may use and designate equity derivatives as hedging instruments, including puts, calls, swaps, and forwards.\u00a0as of june\u00a030, 2014, the total notional amounts of equity contracts purchased and sold for managing market price risk were $3.1 billion and $2.1 billion, respectively, of which $362 million and $420 million, respectively, were designated as hedging instruments. as of june\u00a030, 2013, the total notional amounts of equity contracts purchased and sold for managing market price risk were $898 million and $1.0 billion, respectively, none of which were designated as hedging instruments.  interest rate  securities held in our fixed-income portfolio are subject to different interest rate risks based on their maturities. we manage the average maturity of our fixed-income portfolio to achieve economic returns that correlate to certain broad-based fixed-income indices using exchange-traded option and futures contracts and over-the-counter swap and option contracts, none of which are designated as hedging instruments. as of june\u00a030, 2014, the total notional amounts of fixed-interest rate contracts purchased and sold were $503 million and $741 million, respectively. as of june\u00a030, 2013, the total notional amounts of fixed-interest rate contracts purchased and sold were $1.1 billion and $809 million, respectively.  in addition, we use \u0093to be announced\u0094 forward purchase commitments of mortgage-backed assets to gain exposure to agency mortgage-backed securities.\u00a0these meet the definition of a derivative instrument in cases where physical delivery of the assets is not taken at the earliest available delivery date. as of june\u00a030, 2014 and 2013, the total notional derivative amounts of mortgage contracts purchased were $1.1 billion and $1.2 billion, respectively.  \u00a0 68  table of contents  \u00a0 part ii  item 8  \u00a0 credit  our fixed-income portfolio is diversified and consists primarily of investment-grade securities. we use credit default swap contracts, not designated as hedging instruments, to manage credit exposures relative to broad-based indices and to facilitate portfolio diversification. we use credit default swaps as they are a low cost method of managing exposure to individual credit risks or groups of credit risks. as of june\u00a030, 2014, the total notional amounts of credit contracts purchased and sold were $412 million and $440 million, respectively. as of june\u00a030, 2013, the total notional amounts of credit contracts purchased and sold were $377 million and $501 million, respectively.  commodity  we use broad-based commodity exposures to enhance portfolio returns and to facilitate portfolio diversification. we use swaps, futures, and option contracts, not designated as hedging instruments, to generate and manage exposures to broad-based commodity indices. we use derivatives on commodities as they can be low-cost alternatives to the purchase and storage of a variety of commodities, including, but not limited to, precious metals, energy, and grain. as of june\u00a030, 2014, the total notional amounts of commodity contracts purchased and sold were $1.4 billion and $408 million, respectively. as of june\u00a030, 2013, the total notional amounts of commodity contracts purchased and sold were $1.2 billion and $249 million, respectively.  credit-risk-related contingent features  certain of our counterparty agreements for derivative instruments contain provisions that require our issued and outstanding long-term unsecured debt to maintain an investment grade credit rating and require us to maintain minimum liquidity of $1.0 billion. to the extent we fail to meet these requirements, we will be required to post collateral, similar to the standard convention related to over-the-counter derivatives. as of june\u00a030, 2014, our long-term unsecured debt rating was aaa, and cash investments were in excess of $1.0 billion. as a result, no collateral was required to be posted.  \u00a0 69  table of contents  \u00a0 part ii  item 8  \u00a0 fair values of derivative instruments  the following tables present the fair values of derivative instruments designated as hedging instruments (\u0093designated hedge derivatives\u0094) and not designated as hedging instruments (\u0093non-designated hedge derivatives\u0094). the fair values exclude the impact of netting derivative assets and liabilities when a legally enforceable master netting agreement exists and fair value adjustments related to our own credit risk and counterparty credit risk:  \u00a0 see also note 4 \u0096 investments and note\u00a06\u00a0\u0096 fair value measurements.  \u00a0 70  table of contents  \u00a0 part ii  item 8  \u00a0 fair value hedge gains (losses)  we recognized in other income (expense) the following gains (losses) on contracts designated as fair value hedges and their related hedged items:  \u00a0 cash flow hedge gains (losses)  we recognized the following gains (losses) on foreign exchange contracts designated as cash flow hedges (our only cash flow hedges during the periods presented):  \u00a0 we estimate that $32 million of net derivative gains included in aoci at june\u00a030, 2014 will be reclassified into earnings within the following 12 months. no significant amounts of gains (losses) were reclassified from aoci into earnings as a result of forecasted transactions that failed to occur during fiscal year 2014.  non-designated derivative gains (losses)  gains (losses) from changes in fair values of derivatives that are not designated as hedges are primarily recognized in other income (expense). these amounts are shown in the table below, with the exception of gains (losses) on derivatives presented in income statement line items other than other income (expense), which were immaterial for the periods presented. other than those derivatives entered into for investment purposes, such as commodity contracts, the gains (losses) below are generally economically offset by unrealized gains (losses) in the underlying available-for-sale securities.  \u00a0 \u00a0 71  table of contents  \u00a0 part ii  item 8  \u00a0 note 6 - fair value measurements  assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis  the following tables present the fair value of our financial instruments that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis:  \u00a0 \u00a0 in connection with the transaction to acquire substantially all of nokia corporation\u0092s (\u0093nokia\u0094) devices and services business (\u0093nds\u0094), on september\u00a023, 2013 we provided nokia \u00801.5 billion ($2.1 billion) principal of convertible notes classified as level 3 financial instruments. upon closing of the acquisition, nokia repurchased these notes at their principal amount plus accrued interest. all other changes in our level 3 financial instruments that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis were immaterial during the periods presented.  \u00a0 72  table of contents  \u00a0 part ii  item 8  \u00a0 the following table reconciles the total net fair value of assets above to the balance sheet presentation of these same assets in note 4 \u0096 investments.  \u00a0 \u00a0 financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis  during fiscal year 2014 and 2013, we did not record any material other-than-temporary impairments on financial assets required to be measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis.  note 7 - inventories  the components of inventories were as follows:  \u00a0 note 8 - property and equipment  the components of property and equipment were as follows:  \u00a0 during fiscal years 2014, 2013, and 2012, depreciation expense was $3.4 billion, $2.6 billion, and $2.2 billion, respectively.  \u00a0 73  table of contents  \u00a0 part ii  item 8  \u00a0 note 9 - business combinations  nokia\u0092s devices and services business  on april\u00a025, 2014, we completed the transaction to acquire substantially all of nds for a total purchase price of $9.5 billion, including cash acquired of $1.5 billion (\u0093the acquisition\u0094). the purchase price consisted primarily of cash of $7.1 billion and nokia\u0092s repurchase of convertible notes of $2.1 billion which was a non-cash transaction. the acquisition is expected to accelerate the growth of our devices and consumer (\u0093d&c\u0094) business through faster innovation, synergies, and unified branding and marketing.  the purchase price allocation as of the date of the acquisition was based on a preliminary valuation and is subject to revision as more detailed analyses are completed and additional information about the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed become available.  the major classes of assets and liabilities to which we have preliminarily allocated the purchase price were as follows:  \u00a0 \u00a0 following are the details of the purchase price allocated to the intangible assets acquired:  \u00a0 our consolidated income statement for fiscal year 2014 includes revenue and operating loss of $2.0 billion and $692 million, respectively, attributable to nds since the acquisition.  \u00a0 74  table of contents  \u00a0 part ii  item 8  \u00a0 following are the supplemental consolidated results of microsoft corporation on an unaudited pro forma basis, as if the acquisition had been consummated on july\u00a01, 2012:  \u00a0 these pro forma results were based on estimates and assumptions, which we believe are reasonable. they are not the results that would have been realized had we been a combined company during the periods presented and are not necessarily indicative of our consolidated results of operations in future periods. the pro forma results include adjustments primarily related to purchase accounting adjustments and the elimination of related party transactions between microsoft and nds. acquisition costs and other non-recurring charges incurred are included in the earliest period presented.  during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2014, we incurred $21 million of acquisition costs associated with the purchase of nds. acquisition costs are primarily comprised of transaction fees and direct acquisition costs, including legal, finance, consulting, and other professional fees. these costs are included in integration and restructuring costs on our consolidated income statement for fiscal year 2014.  certain concurrent transactions were recognized separately from the acquisition. prior to the acquisition, we had joint strategic initiatives with nokia; this contractual relationship was terminated in conjunction with the acquisition. no gain or loss was recorded upon termination of this agreement, as it was determined to be at market value. in addition, we agreed to license nokia\u0092s mapping services and will pay nokia separately for the services provided under a four-year license as they are rendered.  yammer  on july\u00a018, 2012, we acquired yammer, inc. (\u0093yammer\u0094), a leading provider of enterprise social networks, for $1.1 billion in cash. yammer will continue to develop its standalone service and will add an enterprise social networking service to microsoft\u0092s portfolio of complementary cloud-based services. the major classes of assets to which we allocated the purchase price were goodwill of $937 million and identifiable intangible assets of $178 million. we assigned the goodwill to commercial other under our current segment structure. yammer was consolidated into our results of operations starting on the acquisition date.  skype  on october\u00a013, 2011, we acquired skype global s.\u00e1 r.l. (\u0093skype\u0094), a leading global provider of software applications and related internet communications products based in luxembourg, for $8.6 billion, primarily in cash. the major classes of assets and liabilities to which we allocated the purchase price were goodwill of $7.1 billion, identifiable intangible assets of $1.6 billion, and unearned revenue of $222 million. the goodwill recognized in connection with the acquisition is primarily attributable to our expectation of extending skype\u0092s brand and the reach of its networked platform, while enhancing microsoft\u0092s existing portfolio of real-time communications products and services. we assigned the goodwill to the following segments under our current segment structure: $5.6 billion to commercial licensing, $1.4 billion to computing and gaming hardware, and $54 million to d&c other. skype was consolidated into our results of operations starting on the acquisition date.  \u00a0 75  table of contents  \u00a0 part ii  item 8  \u00a0 following are the details of the purchase price allocated to the intangible assets acquired:  \u00a0 other  during fiscal year 2014, we completed five additional acquisitions for total consideration of $140 million, all of which was paid in cash. these entities have been included in our consolidated results of operations since their respective acquisition dates.  with the exception of nds, pro forma results of operations have not been presented because the effects of the business combinations described in this note, individually and in aggregate, were not material to our consolidated results of operations.  note 10 - goodwill  changes in the carrying amount of goodwill were as follows:  \u00a0 \u00a0 the measurement periods for the valuation of assets acquired and liabilities assumed end as soon as information on the facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition dates becomes available, but do not exceed 12 months. adjustments in purchase price allocations may require a recasting of the amounts allocated to goodwill retroactive to the periods in which the acquisitions occurred.  \u00a0 76  table of contents  \u00a0 part ii  item 8  \u00a0 any change in the goodwill amounts resulting from foreign currency translations are presented as \u0093other\u0094 in the above table. also included in \u0093other\u0094 are business dispositions and transfers between business segments due to reorganizations, as applicable.  as discussed in note 21 \u0096 segment information and geographic data, during the first quarter of fiscal year 2014, we changed our organizational structure as part of our transformation to a devices and services company. this resulted in a change in our operating segments and reporting units. we allocated goodwill to our new reporting units using a relative fair value approach. in addition, we completed an assessment of any potential goodwill impairment for all reporting units immediately prior to the reallocation and determined that no impairment existed.  goodwill impairment  we test goodwill for impairment annually on may\u00a01 at the reporting unit level using a discounted cash flow methodology with a peer-based, risk-adjusted weighted average cost of capital. we believe use of a discounted cash flow approach is the most reliable indicator of the fair values of the businesses.  no impairment of goodwill was identified as of may\u00a01, 2014 or may\u00a01, 2013. upon completion of the fiscal year 2012 test, the goodwill of our osd unit (in devices and consumer other under our current segment structure) was determined to be impaired. the impairment was the result of the osd unit experiencing slower than projected growth in search queries and search advertising revenue per query, slower growth in display revenue, and changes in the timing and implementation of certain initiatives designed to drive search and display revenue growth in the future. this goodwill impairment charge of $6.2 billion also represented our accumulated goodwill impairment as of june\u00a030, 2014 and 2013.  note 11 - intangible assets  the components of intangible assets, all of which are finite-lived, were as follows:  \u00a0 \u00a0 we estimate that we have no significant residual value related to our intangible assets. no material impairments of intangible assets were identified during any of the periods presented.  the components of intangible assets acquired during the periods presented were as follows:  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 77  table of contents  \u00a0 part ii  item 8  \u00a0 the table above includes $4.5 billion related to the acquisition of nds during fiscal year 2014. see note 9 \u0096 business combination for additional details.  intangible assets amortization expense was $845 million, $739 million, and $558 million for fiscal years 2014, 2013, and 2012, respectively. amortization of capitalized software was $200 million, $210 million, and $117 million for fiscal years 2014, 2013, and 2012, respectively.  the following table outlines the estimated future amortization expense related to intangible assets held at june\u00a030, 2014:  \u00a0 note 12 - debt  as of june\u00a030, 2014, we had $22.6 billion of issued and outstanding debt, comprising $2.0 billion of short-term debt and $20.6 billion of long-term debt. as of june 30, 2013, we had $15.6 billion of issued and outstanding long-term debt.  short-term debt  as of june\u00a030, 2014, we had $2.0 billion of commercial paper issued and outstanding, with a weighted-average interest rate of 0.12% and maturities ranging from 86 days to 91 days. the estimated fair value of this commercial paper approximates its carrying value.  we have a $5.0 billion credit facility that expires on november\u00a014, 2018, which serves as a back-up for our commercial paper program. as of june\u00a030, 2014, we were in compliance with the only financial covenant in the credit agreement, which requires us to maintain a coverage ratio of at least three times earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization to interest expense, as defined in the credit agreement. no amounts were drawn against the credit facility during any of the periods presented.  long-term debt  as of june\u00a030, 2014, the total carrying value and estimated fair value of our long-term debt were $20.6 billion and $21.5 billion, respectively. this is compared to a carrying value and estimated fair value of our long-term debt, including the current portion, of $15.6 billion and $15.8 billion, respectively, as of june\u00a030, 2013. these estimated fair values are based on level 2 inputs.  \u00a0 78  table of contents  \u00a0 part ii  item 8  \u00a0 the components of our long-term debt and the associated interest rates were as follows as of june\u00a030, 2014 and 2013:  \u00a0 \u00a0 the notes in this table are senior unsecured obligations and rank equally with our other senior unsecured debt outstanding. interest on these notes is paid semi-annually, except for the euro-denominated debt securities on which interest is paid annually. cash paid for interest on our debt for fiscal years 2014, 2013, and 2012 was $509 million, $371 million, and $344 million, respectively. as of june\u00a030, 2014 and 2013, the aggregate unamortized discount for our long-term debt, including the current portion, was $100 million and $65 million, respectively.  \u00a0 79  table of contents  \u00a0 part ii  item 8  \u00a0 debt service  maturities of our long-term debt for each of the next five years and thereafter are as follows:  \u00a0 note 13 - income taxes  the components of the provision for income taxes were as follows:  \u00a0 u.s. and foreign components of income before income taxes were as follows:  \u00a0 the items accounting for the difference between income taxes computed at the u.s. federal statutory rate and our effective rate were as follows:  \u00a0 the reduction from the federal statutory rate from foreign earnings taxed at lower rates results from producing and distributing our products and services through our foreign regional operations centers in ireland, singapore, and  \u00a0 80  table of contents  \u00a0 part ii  item 8  \u00a0  puerto rico. our foreign earnings, which are taxed at rates lower than the u.s. rate and are generated from our regional operating centers, were 81%, 79%, and 79% of our foreign income before tax in fiscal years 2014, 2013, and 2012, respectively. in general, other reconciling items consist of interest, adjustments for intercompany transfer pricing, u.s. state income taxes, domestic production deductions, and credits. in fiscal years 2014, 2013, and 2012, there were no individually significant other reconciling items.  the components of the deferred income tax assets and liabilities were as follows:  \u00a0 as of june\u00a030, 2014, we had net operating loss carryforwards of $3.6 billion, including $2.2 billion of foreign net operating loss carryforwards acquired through our acquisition of skype, and $545 million through our acquisition of nds. the valuation allowance disclosed in the table above relates to the foreign net operating loss carryforwards and other net deferred tax assets that may not be realized.  deferred income tax balances reflect the effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases and are stated at enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when the taxes are actually paid or recovered.  as of june\u00a030, 2014, we have not provided deferred u.s. income taxes or foreign withholding taxes on temporary differences of approximately $92.9 billion resulting from earnings for certain non-u.s. subsidiaries which are permanently reinvested outside the u.s. the unrecognized deferred tax liability associated with these temporary differences was approximately $29.6 billion at june\u00a030, 2014.  income taxes paid were $5.5 billion, $3.9 billion, and $3.5 billion in fiscal years 2014, 2013, and 2012, respectively.  \u00a0 81  table of contents  \u00a0 part ii  item 8  \u00a0 uncertain tax positions  unrecognized tax benefits as of june\u00a030, 2014, 2013, and 2012, were $8.7 billion, $8.6 billion, and $7.2 billion, respectively. if recognized, these tax benefits would affect our effective tax rates for fiscal years 2014, 2013, and 2012, by $7.0 billion, $6.5 billion, and $6.2 billion, respectively.  as of june\u00a030, 2014, 2013, and 2012, we had accrued interest expense related to uncertain tax positions of $1.5 billion, $1.3 billion, and $939 million, respectively, net of federal income tax benefits. interest expense on unrecognized tax benefits was $235 million, $400 million, and $154 million in fiscal years 2014, 2013, and 2012, respectively.  the aggregate changes in the balance of unrecognized tax benefits were as follows:  \u00a0 during the third quarter of fiscal year 2011, we reached a settlement of a portion of an i.r.s. audit of tax years 2004 to 2006, which reduced our income tax expense by $461 million. while we settled a portion of the i.r.s. audit, we remain under audit for these years. in february 2012, the i.r.s. withdrew its 2011 revenue agents report and reopened the audit phase of the examination. as of june\u00a030, 2014, the primary unresolved issue relates to transfer pricing, which could have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements if not resolved favorably. we believe our allowances for income tax contingencies are adequate. we have not received a proposed assessment for the unresolved issues and do not expect a final resolution of these issues in the next 12 months.\u00a0based on the information currently available, we do not anticipate a significant increase or decrease to our tax contingencies for these issues within the next 12 months. we also continue to be subject to examination by the i.r.s. for tax years 2007 to 2013.  we are subject to income tax in many jurisdictions outside the u.s. our operations in certain jurisdictions remain subject to examination for tax years 1996 to 2013, some of which are currently under audit by local tax authorities. the resolutions of these audits are not expected to be material to our consolidated financial statements.  note 14 - unearned revenue  unearned revenue by segment was as follows, with segments with significant balances shown separately:  \u00a0 \u00a0 82  table of contents  \u00a0 part ii  item 8  \u00a0 note 15 - other long-term liabilities  \u00a0 note 16 - commitments and guarantees  construction and operating leases  we have committed $880 million for constructing new buildings, building improvements, and leasehold improvements as of june\u00a030, 2014.  we have operating leases for most u.s. and international sales and support offices, research and development facilities, manufacturing facilities, and certain equipment. rental expense for facilities operating leases was $874 million, $711 million, and $639 million, in fiscal years 2014, 2013, and 2012, respectively. future minimum rental commitments under non-cancellable facilities operating leases in place as of june\u00a030, 2014 are as follows:  \u00a0 indemnifications  we provide indemnifications of varying scope and size to certain customers against claims of intellectual property infringement made by third parties arising from the use of our products and certain other matters. we evaluate estimated losses for these indemnifications, and we consider such factors as the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss. to date, we have not encountered significant costs as a result of these obligations and have not accrued any liabilities related to these indemnifications in our consolidated financial statements.  note 17 - contingencies  antitrust, unfair competition, and overcharge class actions  a large number of antitrust and unfair competition class action lawsuits were filed against us in various state, federal, and canadian courts on behalf of various classes of direct and indirect purchasers of our pc operating system and certain other software products between 1999 and 2005.  we obtained dismissals or reached settlements of all claims made in the united states. under the settlements, generally class members can obtain vouchers that entitle them to be reimbursed for purchases of a wide variety of platform-neutral computer hardware and software. the total value of vouchers that we may issue varies by state. we will make available to certain schools a percentage of those vouchers that are not issued or claimed (one-half to two- \u00a0 83  table of contents  \u00a0 part ii  item 8  \u00a0  thirds depending on the state). the total value of vouchers we ultimately issue will depend on the number of class members who make claims and are issued vouchers. we estimate the total remaining cost of the settlements is approximately $400 million, all of which had been accrued as of june\u00a030, 2014.  three similar cases pending in british columbia, ontario, and quebec, canada have not been settled. in march 2010, the court in the british columbia case certified it as a class action. the plaintiffs successfully appealed a british columbia court of appeal decision reversing class certification and dismissing the case. in october 2013, the canadian supreme court reversed the appellate court and reinstated part of the british columbia case, which is now scheduled for trial in september 2015. the other two cases were inactive pending action by the supreme court on the british columbia case.  other antitrust litigation and claims  novell litigation  in november 2004, novell, inc. (\u0093novell\u0094) filed a complaint in u.s. district court for the district of utah (later transferred to federal court in maryland), asserting antitrust and unfair competition claims against us related to novell\u0092s ownership of wordperfect and other productivity applications during the period between june 1994 and march 1996. after the trial court dismissed or granted summary judgment on a number of novell\u0092s claims, trial of the one remaining claim took place in late 2011 and resulted in a mistrial. in july 2012, the trial court granted microsoft\u0092s motion for judgment as a matter of law. novell appealed this decision to the u.s. court of appeals for the tenth circuit, which affirmed the trial court\u0092s decision in september 2013. the supreme court denied novell\u0092s petition for review in april 2014.  go computer litigation  in june 2005, go computer inc. and co-founder jerry kaplan filed a complaint in california state court asserting antitrust claims under the cartwright act related to the business of the former go corporation in the early 1990s and its successor in interest, lucent corporation in the early 2000s. all claims prior to june 2001 have been dismissed with prejudice as barred by the statute of limitations. after a mini-trial on standing issues, the case is now moving forward with discovery, and a trial is set for september 2015.  china state administration for industry and commerce investigation  on july 28, 2014, microsoft was informed that china\u0092s state administration for industry and commerce (saic) had begun a formal investigation relating to china\u0092s anti-monopoly law, and the saic conducted onsite inspections of microsoft offices in beijing, shanghai, guangzhou, and chengdu. saic has stated the investigation relates to compatibility, bundle sales, and file verification issues related to windows and office software.  patent and intellectual property claims  motorola litigation  in october 2010, microsoft filed patent infringement complaints against motorola mobility (\u0093motorola\u0094) with the international trade commission (\u0093itc\u0094) and in u.s. district court in seattle for infringement of nine microsoft patents by motorola\u0092s android devices. since then, microsoft and motorola have filed additional claims against each other with the itc, in federal district courts in seattle, wisconsin, florida, and california, and in courts in germany and the united kingdom. the nature of the claims asserted and status of individual matters are summarized below.  international trade commission  in may 2012, the itc issued a limited exclusion order against motorola on one microsoft patent, which became effective in july\u00a02012 and was affirmed on appeal in december 2013. in july 2013, microsoft filed an action in u.s. district court in washington, d.c. seeking an order to compel enforcement of the itc\u0092s may 2012 import ban against infringing motorola products by the bureau of customs and border protection (\u0093cbp\u0094), after learning that cbp had failed to fully enforce the order.  \u00a0 84  table of contents  \u00a0 part ii  item 8  \u00a0 in november 2010, motorola filed an action against microsoft with the itc alleging infringement of five motorola patents by xbox consoles and accessories and seeking an exclusion order to prohibit importation of the allegedly infringing xbox products. at motorola\u0092s request, the itc terminated its investigation of four motorola patents. in march 2013, the itc affirmed there was no violation of the remaining motorola patent. motorola appealed the itc\u0092s decision to the u.s. court of appeals for the federal circuit.  u.s. district court  the seattle district court case filed in october 2010 by microsoft as a companion to microsoft\u0092s itc case against motorola was stayed pending the outcome of the itc case.  in november 2010, microsoft sued motorola for breach of contract in u.s. district court in seattle, alleging that motorola breached its commitments to standards-setting organizations to license to microsoft certain patents on reasonable and non-discriminatory (\u0093rand\u0094) terms and conditions. motorola has declared these patents essential to the implementation of the h.264 video standard and the 802.11 wi-fi standard. in the motorola itc case described above and in suits described below, motorola or a motorola affiliate subsequently sued microsoft on those patents in u.s. district courts, in the itc, and in germany. in february 2012, the seattle district court granted a partial summary judgment in favor of microsoft ruling that (1)\u00a0motorola had committed to standards organizations to license its declared-essential patents on rand terms and conditions; and (2)\u00a0microsoft is a third-party beneficiary of those commitments. after trial, the seattle district court set per unit royalties for motorola\u0092s h.264 and 802.11 patents, which resulted in an immaterial microsoft liability. in september 2013, following trial of microsoft\u0092s breach of contract claim, a jury awarded $14.5 million in damages to microsoft. motorola appealed.  cases filed by motorola in wisconsin, california, and florida, with the exception of one currently stayed case in wisconsin (a companion case to motorola\u0092s itc action), have been transferred to the u.s district court in seattle. motorola and microsoft both seek damages as well as injunctive relief. the court has stayed these cases on agreement of the parties.  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 germany  in july 2011, motorola filed patent infringement actions in germany against microsoft and several microsoft subsidiaries.  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 85  table of contents  \u00a0 part ii  item 8  \u00a0 in lawsuits microsoft filed in germany in 2011 and 2012, microsoft asserts that motorola android devices infringe microsoft patents and is seeking damages and injunctions. in 2012, regional courts in germany issued injunctions on three of the microsoft patents, which motorola appealed. one judgment has been affirmed on appeal (and motorola has further appealed), and the other two appeals are pending. in actions filed separately by motorola to invalidate these patents, the federal patent court in 2013 and 2014 held the microsoft patents invalid, and microsoft appealed. for the cases in which microsoft obtained injunctions, if motorola were to prevail following all appeals, motorola could have a claim against microsoft for damages caused by an erroneously granted injunction.  united kingdom  in december 2011, microsoft filed an action against motorola in the high court of justice, chancery division, patents court, in london, england, seeking to revoke the uk part of the european patent asserted by motorola in germany against the activesync protocol. in february 2012, motorola counterclaimed alleging infringement of the patent and seeking damages and an injunction. in december 2012, the court ruled that motorola\u0092s patent is invalid. the court also ruled that the patent, even if valid, would be licensed under the grant-back clause in google\u0092s activesync license. motorola appealed and the appeals court affirmed the lower court\u0092s ruling in microsoft\u0092s favor in november 2013. motorola has exhausted all appeals and the rulings in microsoft\u0092s favor are final.  ipcom patent litigation  ipcom gmbh\u00a0& co. is a german company that holds a large portfolio of mobile technology related patents spanning about 170 patent families and addressing a broad range of cellular technologies. ipcom has asserted 19 of these patents in litigation against nokia and many of the leading cell phone companies and operators. three of the infringement suits against nokia (now assumed by microsoft through the nds acquisition) are still pending in courts in germany, england, and italy. these courts have held a number of ipcom\u0092s patents were invalid or not infringed. we continue to contest the validity or infringement of the patents remaining in dispute.  interdigital patent litigation  interdigital technology corporation and interdigital communications corporation (collectively, \u0093idt\u0094) filed four patent infringement cases against nokia in the itc and in u.s. district court for the district of delaware between 2007 and 2013. we are being substituted for nokia in these cases. each case includes other co-defendants because most of the patents at issue allegedly relate to 3g and 4g wireless communications standards essential functionality. the suite of cases include three itc investigations where idt is seeking an order excluding importation of 3g and 4g phones into the u.s. and one active case in u.s. district court in delaware seeking an injunction and damages.  european copyright levies  we have assumed from nokia all potential liability due to nokia\u0092s alleged failure to pay \u0093private copying levies\u0094 in various european countries based upon sale of memory cards and mobile phones that incorporate blank memory.\u00a0the levies are based upon a 2001 eu directive establishing a right for end users to make copies of copyrighted works for personal or private use, but also allowing the collection of levies based upon sales of blank media or recording devices to compensate copyright holders for private copying.\u00a0various collecting societies in eu countries initiated litigation against nokia, stating that nokia must pay levies not only based upon sales of blank memory cards, but also phones that include blank memory for data storage on the phones, regardless of actual usage of that memory.\u00a0the most significant cases against nokia are pending in germany and austria, due to both high volume of sales and high levy amounts sought in these countries.\u00a0we are litigating against certain collecting societies on the basis that the levy schemes exceed what the eu directive and european court of justice decisions permit.  other patent and intellectual property claims  in addition to these cases, there are approximately 90 other patent infringement cases pending against microsoft.  \u00a0 86  table of contents  \u00a0 part ii  item 8  \u00a0 product-related litigation  u.s. cell phone litigation  nokia, along with other handset manufacturers and network operators, is a defendant in 19 lawsuits filed in the superior court for the district of columbia by individual plaintiffs who allege that radio emissions from cellular handsets caused their brain tumors and other adverse health effects. we have assumed responsibility for these claims as part of the nds acquisition. nine of these cases were filed in 2002 and are consolidated for certain pre-trial proceedings; the remaining ten cases are stayed. in a separate 2009 decision, the court of appeals for the district of columbia held that adverse health effect claims arising from the use of cellular handsets that operate within the u.s. federal communications commission radio frequency emission guidelines (\u0093fcc guidelines\u0094) are pre-empted by federal law. the plaintiffs allege that their handsets either operated outside the fcc guidelines or were manufactured before the fcc guidelines went into effect. the lawsuits also allege an industry-wide conspiracy to manipulate the science and testing around emission guidelines. in september 2013, defendants in the consolidated cases moved to exclude plaintiffs\u0092 expert evidence of general causation on the basis of flawed scientific methodologies. the motion was heard in december 2013 and january 2014. in march 2014, defendants filed a separate motion to preclude plaintiffs\u0092 general causation testimony on the ground that it is pre-empted by federal law because the experts challenge the safety of all cellular handsets, including those that comply with the fcc guidelines. both motions are pending.  canadian cell phone class action  nokia, along with other handset manufacturers and network operators, is a defendant in a 2013 class action lawsuit filed in the supreme court of british columbia by a purported class of canadians who have used cellular phones for at least 1600 hours, including a subclass of users with brain tumors. microsoft was served with the complaint in june 2014. the litigation is not yet active as several defendants remain to be served.  other  we also are subject to a variety of other claims and suits that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of our business. although management currently believes that resolving claims against us, individually or in aggregate, will not have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements, these matters are subject to inherent uncertainties and management\u0092s view of these matters may change in the future.  as of june\u00a030, 2014, we had accrued aggregate liabilities of $780 million in other current liabilities and $81 million in other long-term liabilities for all of our legal matters that were contingencies as of that date. while we intend to defend these matters vigorously, adverse outcomes that we estimate could reach approximately $2.0 billion in aggregate beyond recorded amounts are reasonably possible. were unfavorable final outcomes to occur, there exists the possibility of a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements for the period in which the effects become reasonably estimable. substantially all changes from the prior quarter in these accruals and estimates are attributable to matters involving nokia that we assumed as a result of the nds acquisition.  note 18 - stockholders\u0092 equity  shares outstanding  shares of common stock outstanding were as follows:  \u00a0 \u00a0 87  table of contents  \u00a0 part ii  item 8  \u00a0 share repurchases  on september\u00a016, 2013, our board of

and may be suspended or discontinued at any time without notice. this new share repurchase program replaced the share repurchase program that was announced on september\u00a022, 2008 and expired on september\u00a030, 2013. as of june\u00a030, 2014, $35.1 billion remained of our $40.0 billion share repurchase program. all repurchases were made using cash resources.  we repurchased the following shares of common stock under the above-described repurchase plans:  \u00a0 \u00a0 the above table excludes shares repurchased to settle statutory employee tax withholding related to the vesting of stock awards.  dividends  in fiscal year 2014, our board of directors declared the following dividends:  \u00a0 the dividend declared on june\u00a010, 2014 will be paid after the filing date of this

the following table summarizes the changes in accumulated other comprehensive income by component:  \u00a0 note 20 - employee stock and savings plans  we grant stock-based compensation to directors and employees. at june\u00a030, 2014, an aggregate of 346\u00a0million shares were authorized for future grant under our stock plans, covering stock options, stock awards, and leadership stock awards. awards that expire or are canceled without delivery of shares generally become available for issuance under the plans. we issue new shares of microsoft common stock to satisfy exercises and vesting of awards granted under all of our stock plans.  stock-based compensation expense and related income tax benefits were as follows:  \u00a0 stock plans  stock awards  stock awards (\u0093sas\u0094) are grants that entitle the holder to shares of microsoft common stock as the award vests. sas generally vest over a four or five-year period.  \u00a0 89  table of contents  \u00a0 part ii  item 8  \u00a0 executive incentive plan  under the executive incentive plan (\u0093eip\u0094), the compensation committee awards performance-based compensation comprising both cash and sas to executive officers and certain senior executives. for executive officers, their awards are based on an aggregate incentive pool equal to a percentage of consolidated operating income. for fiscal years 2014, 2013, and 2012, the pool was 0.44%, 0.35%, and 0.30% of operating income, respectively. the sas vest ratably in august of each of the four years following the grant date. the final cash awards will be determined after each performance period based on individual and business performance.  activity for all stock plans  the fair value of each award was estimated on the date of grant using the following assumptions:  \u00a0 during fiscal year 2014, the following activity occurred under our stock plans:  \u00a0 \u00a0 as of june\u00a030, 2014, there was approximately $5.2 billion of total unrecognized compensation costs related to stock awards. these costs are expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 3 years.  during fiscal years 2013 and 2012, the following activity occurred under our stock plans:  \u00a0 total vest-date fair value of stock awards vested was $3.2 billion, $2.8 billion, and $2.4 billion, for fiscal years 2014, 2013, and 2012, respectively.  \u00a0 90  table of contents  \u00a0 part ii  item 8  \u00a0 employee stock purchase plan  we have an employee stock purchase plan (the \u0093plan\u0094) for all eligible employees. shares of our common stock may be purchased by employees at three-month intervals at 90% of the fair market value on the last trading day of each three-month period. employees may purchase shares having a value not exceeding 15% of their gross compensation during an offering period. employees purchased the following shares during the periods presented:  \u00a0 at june\u00a030, 2014, 173\u00a0million shares of our common stock were reserved for future issuance through the plan.  savings plan  we have a savings plan in the u.s. that qualifies under section\u00a0401(k) of the internal revenue code, and a number of savings plans in international locations. participating u.s. employees may contribute up to 75% of their salary, but not more than statutory limits. we contribute fifty cents for each dollar of the first 6% a participant contributes in this plan, with a maximum contribution of the lesser of 3% of a participant\u0092s earnings or 3% of the irs compensation limit for the given year. matching contributions for all plans were $420 million, $393 million, and $373 million in fiscal years 2014, 2013, and 2012, respectively, and were expensed as contributed. matching contributions are invested proportionate to each participant\u0092s voluntary contributions in the investment options provided under the plan. investment options in the u.s. plan include microsoft common stock, but neither participant nor our matching contributions are required to be invested in microsoft common stock.  note 21 - segment information and geographic data  in its operation of the business, management, including our chief operating decision maker, the company\u0092s chief executive officer, reviews certain financial information, including segmented internal profit and loss statements prepared on a basis not consistent with u.s. gaap. the segment information in this note is reported on that basis.  during the first quarter of fiscal year 2014, we changed our organizational structure as part of our transformation to a devices and services company. as a result, information that our chief operating decision maker regularly reviews for purposes of allocating resources and assessing performance changed. therefore, beginning in fiscal year 2014, we reported our financial performance based on our new segments; d&c licensing, d&c hardware, d&c other, commercial licensing, and commercial other. we have recast certain prior period amounts to conform to the way we internally managed and monitored segment performance during fiscal year 2014.  on april\u00a025, 2014, we acquired substantially all of nds. see note 9 \u0096 business combinations for additional details. nds has been included in our consolidated results of operations starting on the acquisition date. we report the financial performance of the acquired business in our new phone hardware segment. prior to the acquisition of nds, financial results associated with our joint strategic initiatives with nokia were reflected in our d&c licensing segment. the contractual relationship with nokia related to those initiatives terminated in conjunction with the acquisition. with the creation of the new phone hardware segment, the d&c hardware segment was renamed computing and gaming hardware in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2014.  our reportable segments are described below.  \u00a0 91  table of contents  \u00a0 part ii  item 8  \u00a0 devices and consumer  our d&c segments develop, manufacture, market, and support products and services designed to entertain and connect people, increase personal productivity, help people simplify tasks and make more informed decisions online, and help advertisers connect with audiences. our d&c segments are:  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 commercial  our commercial segments

operations across the user\u0092s hardware and software. our commercial segments are:  \u00a0 \u00a0 revenue and cost of revenue are generally directly attributed to our segments. certain revenue contracts are allocated among the segments based on the relative value of the underlying products and services. cost of revenue is directly charged to our hardware segments. for the remaining segments, cost of revenue is directly charged in most cases and allocated in certain cases, generally using a relative revenue methodology.  we do not allocate operating expenses to our segments. rather, we allocate them to our two segment groups, devices and consumer and commercial. due to the integrated structure of our business, allocations of expenses are made in certain cases to incent cross-collaboration among our segment groups so that a segment group is not solely burdened by the cost of a mutually beneficial activity as we seek to deliver seamless experiences across devices, whether on-premises or in the cloud.  operating expenses are attributed to our segment groups as follows:  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 92  table of contents  \u00a0 part ii  item 8  \u00a0 certain corporate-level activity is not allocated to our segment groups, including costs of: legal, including expenses, settlements, and fines; information technology; human resources; finance; excise taxes; and integration and restructuring costs.  segment revenue and gross margin were as follows during the periods presented:  \u00a0 \u00a0 following is operating expenses by segment group. as discussed above, we do not allocate operating expenses below cost of revenue to our segments.  \u00a0 \u00a0 93  table of contents  \u00a0 part ii  item 8  \u00a0 following is operating income (loss) by segment group.  \u00a0 corporate and other operating income includes adjustments to conform our internal accounting policies to u.s. gaap and corporate-level activity not specifically attributed to a segment. significant internal accounting policies that differ from u.s. gaap relate to revenue recognition, income statement classification, and depreciation.  corporate and other activity was as follows:  \u00a0 \u00a0 no sales to an individual customer or country other than the united states accounted for more than 10% of fiscal year 2014, 2013, or 2012 revenue. revenue, classified by the major

significant product and service offerings were as follows:  \u00a0 our total commercial cloud revenue was $2.8 billion, $1.3 billion, and $0.7 billion in fiscal years 2014, 2013, and 2012, respectively. these amounts are included in their respective product categories in the table above.  assets are not allocated to segments for internal reporting presentations. a portion of amortization and depreciation is charged to the respective segment. it is impracticable for us to separately identify the amount of amortization and depreciation by segment that is included in the measure of segment profit or loss.  long-lived assets, excluding financial instruments and tax assets, classified by the location of the controlling statutory company and with countries over 10% of the total shown separately, were as follows:  \u00a0 note 22 - quarterly information (unaudited)  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 95  table of contents  \u00a0 part ii  item 8  \u00a0 note 23 - subsequent event  on july\u00a017, 2014, we announced a restructuring plan to simplify our organization and align the recently acquired nds business with our company\u0092s overall strategy. we will eliminate up to 18,000 positions over the next year, including 12,500 professional and factory positions related to the acquisition of nds. we expect to incur pre-tax charges of approximately $1.1 billion to $1.6 billion in fiscal year 2015.  \u00a0 96  table of contents  \u00a0 part ii  item 8  \u00a0 report of independent registered public accounting firm  to the board of directors and stockholders of microsoft corporation  redmond, washington  we have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of microsoft corporation and subsidiaries (the \u0093company\u0094) as of june\u00a030, 2014 and 2013, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, cash flows, and stockholders\u0092 equity for each of the three years in the period ended june\u00a030, 2014.\u00a0these financial statements are the responsibility of the company\u0092s management. our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.  we conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board (united states).\u00a0those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.\u00a0an audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.\u00a0an audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. we believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.  in our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of microsoft corporation and subsidiaries as of june\u00a030, 2014 and 2013, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended june\u00a030, 2014, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america.  we have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board (united states), the company\u0092s internal control over financial reporting as of june\u00a030, 2014, based on the criteria established in internal control \u0096

a growing variety of business models.  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 the competitive pressures described above may result in decreased sales volumes, price reductions, and/or increased operating costs, such as for marketing and sales incentives. this may lead to lower revenue, gross margins, and operating income.  our increasing focus on devices and services presents execution and competitive risks.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0a growing part of our strategy involves cloud-based services used with smart client devices. our competitors are rapidly developing and deploying cloud-based services for consumers and business customers. pricing and delivery models are evolving. devices and form factors influence how users access services in the cloud and in some cases the user\u0092s choice of which suite of cloud-based services to use. we are devoting significant resources to develop and deploy our own competing cloud-based software plus services strategies. while we believe our expertise, investments in infrastructure, and the breadth of our cloud-based services provide us with a strong foundation to compete, it is uncertain whether our strategies will attract the users or generate the revenue required to be successful. in addition to software development costs, we are incurring costs to build and maintain infrastructure to support cloud computing services. these costs may reduce the operating margins we have previously achieved. whether we are successful in this new business model depends on our execution in a number of areas, including:  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 we make significant investments in new products and services that may not be profitable.\u00a0we will continue to make significant investments in research, development, and marketing for existing products, services, and technologies, including the windows operating system, the microsoft office system, bing, windows phone, windows server, the windows store, the windows azure services platform, office 365, other cloud-based services offerings, and the xbox 360 entertainment platform. we will also continue to invest in new software and hardware products, services, and technologies, such as the surface line of microsoft-designed and manufactured devices announced in june 2012. investments in new technology are speculative. commercial success depends on many factors, including innovativeness, developer support, and effective distribution and marketing. if customers do not perceive our latest offerings as providing significant new functionality or other value, they may reduce their purchases of new software products or upgrades, unfavorably impacting revenue. we may not achieve significant revenue from new product and service investments for a number of years, if at all. moreover, new products and services may not be profitable, and even if they are profitable, operating margins for new products and businesses may not be as high as the margins we have experienced historically.  \u00a0 15  table of contents  \u00a0 part i  item 1a  \u00a0 in fall 2012, we are launching windows\u00a08, a major new release of our pc operating system that seeks to deliver a unique user experience through well-integrated software, hardware, and services. its success depends on a number of factors including the extent to which customers embrace its new user interface and functionality, successfully coordinating with our oem partners in releasing a variety of hardware devices that take advantage of its features, and attracting developers at scale to ensure a competitive array of quality applications. we expect to incur substantial marketing costs in launching window 8 and associated services and devices, which may reduce our operating margins.  we may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property rights.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0protecting our global intellectual property rights and combating unlicensed copying and use of software and other intellectual property is difficult. while piracy adversely affects u.s. revenue, the impact on revenue from outside the u.s. is more significant, particularly in countries where laws are less protective of intellectual property rights. as a result, our revenue in these markets may grow slower than the underlying pc market. similarly, the absence of harmonized patent laws makes it more difficult to ensure consistent respect for patent rights. throughout the world, we actively educate consumers about the benefits of licensing genuine products and obtaining indemnification benefits for intellectual property risks, and we educate lawmakers about the advantages of a business climate where intellectual property rights are protected. however, continued educational and enforcement efforts may fail to enhance revenue. reductions in the legal protection for software intellectual property rights could adversely affect revenue.  third parties may claim we infringe their intellectual property rights.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0from time to time, we receive notices from others claiming we infringe their intellectual property rights. the number of these claims may grow because of constant technological change in the segments in which we compete, the extensive patent coverage of existing technologies, and the rapid rate of issuance of new patents. to resolve these claims we may enter into royalty and licensing agreements on terms that are less favorable than currently available, stop selling or redesign affected products, or pay damages to satisfy indemnification commitments with our customers. these outcomes may cause operating margins to decline. in addition to money damages, in some jurisdictions plaintiffs can seek injunctive relief that may limit or prevent importing, marketing, and selling our products that have infringing technologies. in some countries, such as germany, an injunction can be issued before the parties have fully litigated the validity of the underlying patents. we have made and expect to continue making significant expenditures to settle claims related to the use of technology and intellectual property rights and to procure intellectual property rights as part of our strategy to manage this risk.  we may not be able to protect our source code from copying if there is an unauthorized disclosure of source code.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0source code, the detailed program commands for our operating systems and other software programs, is critical to our business. although we license portions of our application and operating system source code to a number of licensees, we take significant measures to protect the secrecy of large portions of our source code. if an unauthorized disclosure of a significant portion of our source code occurs, we could potentially lose future trade secret protection for that source code. this could make it easier for third parties to compete with our products by copying functionality, which could adversely affect our revenue and operating margins. unauthorized disclosure of source code also could increase the security risks described in the next paragraph.  cyber-attacks and security vulnerabilities could lead to reduced revenue, increased costs, liability claims, or harm to our competitive position. security of microsoft\u0092s information technology.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0maintaining the security of computers and computer networks is paramount for us and our customers. threats to information technology (\u0093it\u0094) security can take a variety of forms. hackers develop and deploy viruses, worms, and other malicious software programs that attack our products and services and gain access to our networks and data centers. groups of hackers may also act in a coordinated manner to launch distributed denial of service attacks, or other coordinated attacks. sophisticated organizations or individuals may launch targeted attacks using novel methods to gain access to computers running our software. these threats may result in breaches of our network or data security, disruptions of our internal systems and business applications, impairment of our ability to provide services to our customers, product development delays, harm to our competitive position from the compromise of confidential business information, or other negative impacts on our business.  \u00a0 16  table of contents  \u00a0 part i  item 1a  \u00a0 in addition, our internal it environment continues to evolve. often we are early adopters of new devices and technologies. we embrace new ways of sharing data and communicating internally and with partners and customers using methods such as social networking and other consumer-oriented technologies. these practices can enhance efficiency and business insight, but they also present risks that our business policies and internal security controls may not keep pace with the speed of these changes.  security of our customers\u0092 products and services.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0security threats are a particular challenge to companies like us whose business is technology products and services. the threats to our own it infrastructure also affect our customers. customers using our cloud services rely on the security of our infrastructure to ensure the reliability of our services and the protection of their data. hackers tend to focus their efforts on the most popular operating systems, programs, and services, including many of ours, and we expect them to continue to do so. the security of our products and services is an important consideration in our customers\u0092 purchasing decisions.  we devote significant resources to defend against security threats, both to our internal it systems and those of our customers. these include:  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 the cost of these steps could reduce our operating margins. despite these efforts, actual or perceived security vulnerabilities in our products and services could cause significant reputational harm and lead some customers to reduce or delay future purchases of products or subscriptions to services, or to use competing products. customers may also increase their expenditures on protecting their existing computer systems from attack, which could delay adoption of additional products or services. any of these actions by customers could adversely affect our revenue. actual or perceived vulnerabilities may lead to claims against us. although our license agreements typically contain provisions that eliminate or limit our exposure to such liability, there is no assurance these provisions will withstand all legal challenges. legislative or regulatory action may increase the costs to develop or implement our products and services.  improper disclosure of personal data could result in liability and harm our reputation.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0as we continue to execute our strategy of increasing the number and scale of our cloud-based offerings, we store and process increasingly large amounts of personally identifiable information of our customers. at the same time, the continued occurrence of high-profile data breaches provides evidence of an external environment increasingly hostile to information security. this environment demands that we continuously improve our design and coordination of security controls across our business groups and geographies. despite these efforts, it is possible our security controls over personal data, our training of employees and vendors on data security, and other practices we follow may not prevent the improper disclosure of personally identifiable information that we or our vendors store and manage. improper disclosure of this information could harm our reputation, lead to legal exposure to customers, or subject us to liability under laws that protect personal data, resulting in increased costs or loss of revenue. our software products and services also enable our customers to store and process personal data on premise or, increasingly, in a cloud-based environment we host. we believe consumers using our email, messaging, storage, sharing, and social networking services will increasingly want efficient, centralized methods of choosing their privacy preferences and controlling their data. perceptions that our products or services do not adequately protect the  \u00a0 17  table of contents  \u00a0 part i  item 1a  \u00a0  privacy of personal information could inhibit sales of our products or services, and could constrain consumer and business adoption of our cloud-based solutions.  we may experience outages, data losses, and disruptions of our online services if we fail to maintain an adequate operations infrastructure.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0our increasing user traffic and complexity of our products and services demand more computing power. we have spent and expect to continue to spend substantial amounts to purchase or lease data centers and equipment and to upgrade our technology and network infrastructure to handle increased traffic on our websites and in our data centers, and to introduce new products and services and support existing services such as bing, exchange online, office 365, sharepoint online, skype, xbox live, windows azure, windows live, and microsoft office web apps. we also are growing our business of providing a platform and back-end hosting for services provided by third-party businesses to their end customers. maintaining and expanding this infrastructure is expensive and complex. inefficiencies or operational failures, including temporary or permanent loss of customer data, could diminish the quality of our products, services, and user experience resulting in contractual liability, claims by customers and other third parties, damage to our reputation and loss of current and potential users, subscribers, and advertisers, each of which may harm our operating results and financial condition.  we are subject to government litigation and regulatory activity that affects how we design and market our products.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0as a leading global software maker, we receive close scrutiny from government agencies under u.s. and foreign competition laws. some jurisdictions also provide private rights of action for competitors or consumers to assert claims of anti-competitive conduct. for example, we have been involved in the following actions.  lawsuits brought by the u.s. department of justice, 18 states, and the district of columbia in two separate actions were resolved through a consent decree that took effect in 2001 and a final judgment entered in 2002. these proceedings imposed various constraints on our windows operating system businesses. these constraints included limits on certain contracting practices, mandated disclosure of certain software program interfaces and protocols, and rights for computer manufacturers to limit the visibility of certain windows features in new pcs. although the consent decree and final judgment expired in may 2011, we expect that federal and state antitrust authorities will continue to closely scrutinize our business.  the european commission closely scrutinizes the design of high-volume microsoft products and the terms on which we make certain technologies used in these products, such as file formats, programming interfaces, and protocols, available to other companies. in 2004, the commission ordered us to create new versions of windows that do not include certain multimedia technologies and to provide our competitors with specifications for how to implement certain proprietary windows communications protocols in their own products. in 2009, the commission accepted a set of commitments offered by microsoft to address the commission\u0092s concerns relating to competition in web browsing software. the commission\u0092s impact on product design may limit our ability to innovate in windows or other products in the future, diminish the developer appeal of the windows platform, and increase our product development costs. the availability of licenses related to protocols and file formats may enable competitors to develop software products that better mimic the functionality of our own products which could result in decreased sales of our\u00a0products.  government regulatory actions and court decisions such as these may hinder our ability to provide the benefits of our software to consumers and businesses, thereby reducing the attractiveness of our products and the revenue that come from them. new actions could be initiated at any time, either by these or other governments or private claimants, including with respect to new versions of windows or other microsoft products. the outcome of such actions, or steps taken to avoid them, could adversely affect us in a variety of ways, including:  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 18  table of contents  \u00a0 part i  item 1a  \u00a0 our products and online services offerings, including new technologies we develop or acquire such as skype, are subject to government regulation in some jurisdictions, including in areas of user privacy, telecommunications, data protection, and online content. the application of these laws and regulations to our business is often unclear, subject to change over time, and sometimes may conflict from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. additionally these laws and governments\u0092 approach to their enforcement, as well as our products and services, are continuing to evolve. compliance with these types of regulation may involve significant costs or require changes in products or business practices that result in reduced revenue. noncompliance could result in penalties being imposed on us or orders that we stop the alleged noncompliant activity.  our business depends on our ability to attract and retain talented employees.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0our business is based on successfully attracting and retaining talented employees. the market for highly skilled workers and leaders in our industry is extremely competitive. we are limited in our ability to recruit internationally by restrictive domestic immigration laws. if we are less successful in our recruiting efforts, or if we are unable to retain key employees, our ability to develop and deliver successful products and services may be adversely affected. effective succession planning is also important to our long-term success. failure to ensure effective transfer of knowledge and smooth transitions involving key employees could hinder our strategic planning and execution.  delays in product development schedules may adversely affect our revenue.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0the development of software products is a complex and time-consuming process. new products and enhancements to existing products can require long development and testing periods. our increasing focus on cloud-based software plus services also presents new and complex development issues. significant delays in new product or service releases or significant problems in creating new products or services could adversely affect our revenue.  we make significant investments in new products and services that may not be profitable.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0our growth depends on our ability to create new and higher value product and service offerings. we will continue to make significant investments in research, development, and marketing for existing products, services, and technologies, including the windows pc operating system, the microsoft office system, bing, windows phone, windows server, the windows store, the windows azure services platform, office 365, other cloud-based services offerings, and the xbox 360 entertainment platform. in june 2012, we announced the surface line of microsoft-designed and manufactured devices. we will also continue to invest in new software and hardware products, services, and technologies. investments in new technology are speculative. commercial success depends on many factors, including innovativeness, developer support, and effective distribution and marketing. our degree of success with windows phone, for example, will impact our ability to grow our share of the smartphone operating system market. it will also be an important factor in supporting our strategy of delivering value to end users seamlessly over a variety of form factors including pc, phone, and tv device classes. if customers do not perceive our latest offerings as providing significant new functionality or other value, they may reduce their purchases of new software products or upgrades, unfavorably impacting revenue. we may not achieve significant revenue from new product and service investments for a number of years, if at all. moreover, new products and services may not be profitable, and even if they are profitable, operating margins for new products and businesses may not be as high as the margins we have experienced historically.  adverse economic conditions may harm our business.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0unfavorable changes in economic conditions, including inflation, recession, or other changes in economic conditions, may result in lower information technology spending and adversely affect our revenue. if demand for pcs, servers, and other computing devices declines, or consumer or business spending for those products declines, our revenue will be adversely affected. our product distribution system also relies on an extensive partner and retail network. original equipment manufacturers (\u0093oems\u0094) building devices that run our software have also been a significant means of distribution. the impact of economic conditions on our partners, such as the bankruptcy of a major distributor, oem, or retailer, could result in sales channel disruption. challenging economic conditions also may impair the ability of our customers to pay for products and  \u00a0 19  table of contents  \u00a0 part i  item 1a  \u00a0  services they have purchased. as a result, allowances for doubtful accounts and write-offs of accounts receivable may increase. we maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings, types, and maturities. these investments are subject to general credit, liquidity, market, and interest rate risks, which may be exacerbated by unusual events that have affected global financial markets. a significant part of our investment portfolio consists of u.s. government securities. if global credit and equity markets experience prolonged periods of decline, or if there is a downgrade of u.s. government debt, our investment portfolio may be adversely impacted and we could determine that more of our investments have experienced an other-than-temporary decline in fair value, requiring impairment charges that could adversely affect our financial results.  we have claims and lawsuits against us that may result in adverse outcomes.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0we are subject to a variety of claims and lawsuits. adverse outcomes in some or all of these claims may result in significant monetary damages or injunctive relief that could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business. although management currently believes resolving all of these matters, individually or in the aggregate, will not have a material adverse impact on our financial statements, the litigation and other claims are subject to inherent uncertainties and management\u0092s view of these matters may change in the future. a material adverse impact on our financial statements also could occur for the period in which the effect of an unfavorable final outcome becomes probable and reasonably estimable.  we may have additional tax liabilities.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0we are subject to income taxes in the u.s. and many foreign jurisdictions. significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes. in the ordinary course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. we regularly are under audit by tax authorities. although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals. the results of an audit or litigation could have a material effect on our financial statements in the period or periods for which that determination is made.  we earn a significant amount of our operating income from outside the u.s., and any repatriation of funds currently held in foreign jurisdictions to the u.s. may result in higher effective tax rates for the company. in addition, there have been proposals to change u.s. tax laws that would significantly impact how u.s. multinational corporations are taxed on foreign earnings. although we cannot predict whether or in what form any proposed legislation may pass, if enacted it could have a material adverse impact on our tax expense and cash flow.  our hardware and software products may experience quality or supply problems.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0our vertically-integrated hardware products such as the xbox 360 console, surface devices, and other hardware devices we design and market are highly complex and can have defects in design, manufacture, or associated software. we could incur significant expenses, lost revenue, and reputational harm if we fail to detect or effectively address such issues through design, testing, or warranty repairs. we obtain some components of our hardware devices from sole suppliers. our competitors use some of the same suppliers and their demand for hardware components can affect the amount of capacity available to us. if a component delivery from a sole-source supplier is delayed or becomes unavailable or industry shortages occur, we may be unable to obtain timely replacement supplies, resulting in reduced sales. either component shortages or excess or obsolete inventory may increase our cost of revenue. xbox 360 consoles are assembled in asia; disruptions in the supply chain may result in console shortages that would affect our revenue and operating margins. these same risks would apply to any other vertically-integrated hardware and software products we may offer.  our stand-alone software products may also experience quality or reliability problems. the highly sophisticated software products we develop may contain bugs and other defects that interfere with their intended operation. any defects we do not detect and fix in pre-release testing could result in reduced sales and revenue, damage to our reputation, repair or remediation costs, delays in the release of new products or versions, or legal liability. although our license agreements typically contain provisions that eliminate or limit our exposure to liability, there is no assurance these provisions will withstand legal challenge.  if our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets become impaired we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0we acquire other companies and may not realize all the economic benefit from those acquisitions, which could result in an impairment of goodwill or intangibles. under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states (\u0093u.s. gaap\u0094), we review our amortizable intangible assets for impairment when  \u00a0 20  table of contents  \u00a0 part i  item 1a  \u00a0  events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. we test goodwill for impairment at least annually. factors that may be considered a change in circumstances, indicating that the carrying value of our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets may not be recoverable, include a decline in stock price and market capitalization, reduced future cash flow estimates, and slower growth rates in our industry. we may be required to record a significant charge in our financial statements during the period in which any impairment of our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets is determined, negatively impacting our results of operations. for example, in july 2012, we announced a $6.2 billion charge for the impairment of goodwill in our online services division business segment.  we operate a global business that exposes us to additional risks.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0we operate in over 100 countries and a significant part of our revenue comes from international sales. pressure to make our pricing structure uniform might require that we reduce the sales price of our software in the u.s. and other countries. operations outside the u.s. may be affected by changes in trade protection laws, policies and measures, and other regulatory requirements affecting trade and investment, including the foreign corrupt practices act and local laws prohibiting corrupt payments by our employees, vendors, or agents. emerging markets are a significant focus of our international growth strategy. the developing nature of these markets presents a number of risks. deterioration of social, political, labor, or economic conditions in a specific country or region, such as current uncertainties relating to european sovereign and other debt, and difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations, may also adversely affect our operations or financial results. although we hedge a portion of our international currency exposure, significant fluctuations in exchange rates between the u.s. dollar and foreign currencies may adversely affect our net revenue.  catastrophic events or geo-political conditions may disrupt our business.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0a disruption or failure of our systems or operations because of a major earthquake, weather event, cyber-attack, terrorist attack, or other catastrophic event could cause delays in completing sales, providing services, or performing other mission-critical functions. our corporate headquarters, a significant portion of our research and development activities, and certain other critical business operations are located in the seattle, washington area, and we have other business operations in the silicon valley area of california, both of which are near major earthquake faults. a catastrophic event that results in the destruction or disruption of any of our critical business or information technology systems could harm our ability to conduct normal business operations. our move toward providing our customers with more services and solutions in the cloud puts a premium on the resilience of our systems and strength of our business continuity management plans, and magnifies the potential impact of prolonged service outages on our operating results. abrupt political change, terrorist activity, and armed conflict pose a risk of general economic disruption in affected countries, which may increase our operating costs. these conditions also may add uncertainty to the timing and budget for technology investment decisions by our customers, and may result in supply chain disruptions for hardware manufacturers, either of which may adversely affect our revenue. the long-term effects of climate change on the global economy in general or the information technology industry in particular are unclear. environmental regulations or changes in the supply, demand or available sources of energy may affect the availability or cost of goods and services, including natural resources, necessary to run our business. changes in weather where we operate may increase the costs of powering and cooling computer hardware we use to develop software and provide cloud-based services. new regulations may require us to find alternative compliant and cost-effective methods of distributing our products and services.  acquisitions, joint ventures and strategic alliances may have an adverse effect on our business.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0we expect to continue making acquisitions or entering into joint ventures and strategic alliances as part of our long-term business strategy. these transactions involve significant challenges and risks including that the transaction does not advance our business strategy, that we do not realize a satisfactory return on our investment, or that we experience difficulty integrating new employees, business systems, and technology, or diversion of management\u0092s attention from our other businesses. our recent acquisition of skype, for example, provides opportunities to enhance our existing products. the success of our integration of skype will depend in part on our ability to provide compelling experiences that distinguish us from our competitors in both consumer and business markets. it may take longer than expected to realize the full benefits from these transactions, such as increased revenue, enhanced efficiencies, or market share, or those benefits may ultimately be smaller than anticipated or may not be realized. these events could harm our operating results or financial condition.  \u00a0 21  table of contents  \u00a0 part ii  item 7  \u00a0  devices, our goal is to provide users with a consistent and compelling experience through a common user interface and our services such as skydrive, xbox live, bing, skype, and our windows azure cloud platform.  communications and productivity  the ubiquity of computing and software tools has transformed personal and business productivity. over the last decade, microsoft redefined software productivity beyond the rich office client on the pc. productivity scenarios now encompass unified communications such as instant messaging, voice, and video communications, business intelligence, collaboration, content management, and relationship management, all of which are increasingly available through server-side applications. these server applications can be hosted in the cloud by the customer, a partner, or by microsoft. there are significant opportunities to bring to life productivity and communication scenarios across pcs, mobile, and other devices that connect to services. we invest significant resources in our products and services that make this possible \u0096 dynamics, exchange, lync, skype, office, office 365, sharepoint, windows live, and windows phone.  cloud computing transforming the data center and information technology  cloud-based solutions provide customers with software, services, and content over the internet by way of shared computing resources located in centralized data centers. computing is undergoing a long-term shift from client/server to the cloud, a shift similar in importance and impact to the transition from mainframe to client/server. the shift to the cloud is driven by three important economies of scale: larger data centers can deploy computational resources at significantly lower cost per unit than smaller ones; larger data centers can coordinate and aggregate diverse customer, geographic, and application demand patterns improving the utilization of computing, storage, and network resources; and multi-tenancy lowers application maintenance labor costs for large public clouds. because of the improved economics, the cloud offers unique levels of elasticity and agility that enables new solutions and applications. for businesses of all sizes, the cloud creates the opportunity to focus on innovation while leaving non-differentiating activities to reliable and cost-effective providers. we are devoting significant resources to developing cloud infrastructure, platforms, and applications including offerings such as microsoft dynamics online, microsoft sql azure, office 365, windows azure, windows intune, and windows server.  economic conditions, challenges, and risks  as discussed above, our industry is dynamic and highly competitive. we must anticipate changes in technology and business models. our model for growth is based on our ability to initiate and embrace disruptive technology trends, to enter new markets, both in terms of geographies and product areas, and to drive broad adoption of the products and services we develop and market.  at microsoft, we prioritize our investments among the highest long-term growth opportunities. these investments require significant resources and are multi-year in nature. the products and services we bring to market may be developed internally, brought to market as part of a partnership or alliance, or through acquisition.  our success is highly dependent on our ability to attract and retain qualified employees. we hire a mix of university and industry talent worldwide. microsoft competes for talented individuals worldwide by offering broad customer reach, scale in resources, and competitive compensation.  demand for our software, services, and hardware has a strong correlation to global macroeconomic factors. the current macroeconomic factors remain dynamic. see a discussion of these factors and other risks under risk factors (part ii, item\u00a01a. of this form 10-k).  seasonality  our revenue historically has fluctuated quarterly and has generally been the highest in the second quarter of our fiscal year due to corporate calendar year-end spending trends in our major markets and holiday season spending  \u00a0 25  table of contents  \u00a0 part ii  item 7  \u00a0  by consumers. our entertainment and devices division is particularly seasonal as its products are aimed at the consumer market and are in highest demand during the holiday shopping season. typically, the entertainment and devices division has generated approximately 40% of its yearly segment revenue in our second fiscal quarter.  unearned revenue  quarterly and annual revenue may be impacted by the deferral of revenue. see the discussions below regarding sales of earlier versions of the microsoft office system with a guarantee to be upgraded to the newest version of the microsoft office system at minimal or no cost (the \u0093office deferral\u0094), sales of windows vista with a guarantee to be upgraded to windows 7 at minimal or no cost (the \u0093windows\u00a07 deferral\u0094), and sales of windows 7 with an option to upgrade to windows 8 pro at a discounted price (the \u0093windows upgrade offer\u0094).  results of operations  summary  \u00a0  fiscal year 2012 compared with fiscal year 2011  revenue increased primarily due to strong sales of server and tools products and services and the 2010 microsoft office system, offset in part by the decline in windows operating system revenue primarily due to the deferral of $540 million of revenue relating to the windows upgrade offer. revenue in fiscal year 2012 also included skype revenue from the date of acquisition.  operating income decreased reflecting a goodwill impairment charge of $6.2 billion related to our osd business segment. other key changes in operating expenses were:  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 headcount-related expenses were higher across the company reflecting a 4% increase in headcount from june\u00a030, 2011 and changes in our employee compensation program.  diluted earnings per share were negatively impacted by the non-tax deductible goodwill impairment charge, which decreased diluted earnings per share by $0.73. prior year net income and diluted earnings per share reflected a partial settlement with the u.s. internal revenue service (\u0093i.r.s.\u0094) and higher other income. the partial settlement with the i.r.s. added $461 million to net income and $0.05 to diluted earnings per share in the prior year.  fiscal year 2011 compared with fiscal year 2010  revenue increased primarily due to strong sales of the xbox 360 entertainment platform, the 2010 microsoft office system, and server and tools products, offset in part by lower windows revenue. revenue also increased due to  \u00a0 26  table of contents  \u00a0 part ii  item 7  \u00a0  the $254 million office deferral in fiscal year 2010 and the subsequent recognition of the office deferral during fiscal year 2011. changes in foreign currency exchange rates had an insignificant impact on revenue.  operating income increased reflecting the change in revenue, offset in part by higher operating expenses. key changes in operating expenses were:  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 diluted earnings per share increased, reflecting higher revenue, repurchases of common stock, and lower income tax expense, offset in part by higher operating expenses.  segment product revenue/operating income (loss)  the revenue and operating income (loss) amounts in this section are presented on a basis consistent with accounting principles generally accepted in the u.s. (\u0093u.s. gaap\u0094) and include certain reconciling items attributable to each of the segments. segment information appearing in note 21 \u0096 segment information and geographic data of the notes to financial statements (part ii, item\u00a08 of this form 10-k) is presented on a basis consistent with our current internal management reporting. certain corporate-level activity has been excluded from segment operating results and is analyzed separately. we have recast certain prior period amounts within this md&a to conform to the way we internally managed and monitored segment performance during the current fiscal year, including moving forefront protection for office, an anti-malware solution, from server and tools to the microsoft business division.  windows\u00a0& windows live division  \u00a0  windows\u00a0& windows live division (\u0093windows division\u0094) develops and markets pc operating systems, related software and online services, and pc hardware products. this collection of software, hardware, and services is designed to simplify everyday tasks through seamless operations across the user\u0092s hardware and software and efficient browsing capabilities. windows division offerings consist of the windows operating system, software and services through windows live, and microsoft pc hardware products.  windows division revenue is largely correlated to the pc market worldwide, as approximately 75% of total windows division revenue comes from windows operating system software purchased by original equipment manufacturers (\u0093oems\u0094) which they pre-install on equipment they sell. the remaining approximately 25% of windows division revenue is generated by commercial and retail sales of windows and pc hardware products and online advertising from windows live.  \u00a0 27  table of contents  \u00a0 part ii  item 7  \u00a0 fiscal year 2012 compared with fiscal year 2011  windows division revenue reflected relative performance in pc market segments. we estimate that sales of pcs to businesses grew approximately 4% and sales of pcs to consumers decreased 1%. excluding a decline in sales of netbooks, we estimate that sales of pcs to consumers grew approximately 5%. taken together, the total pc market increased an estimated 0% to 2%. relative to pc market growth, windows division revenue was negatively impacted by higher growth in emerging markets, where average selling prices are lower than developed markets, and the deferral of $540 million of revenue relating to the windows upgrade offer.  windows division operating income decreased, due mainly to lower revenue and a $163 million or 10% increase in research and development expenses, primarily associated with the windows 8 operating system.  fiscal year 2011 compared with fiscal year 2010  windows division revenue reflected relative performance in pc market segments. we estimate that sales of pcs to businesses grew approximately 11% this year and sales of pcs to consumers declined approximately 1%. the decline in consumer pc sales included an approximately 32% decline in the sales of netbooks. taken together, the total pc market increased an estimated 2% to 4%. revenue was negatively impacted by the effect of higher growth in emerging markets, where average selling prices are lower, relative to developed markets, and by lower recognition of previously deferred windows xp revenue. considering the impact of the windows 7 launch in the prior year, including $273 million of revenue recognized related to the windows 7 deferral, we estimate that windows division revenue was in line with the pc market.  windows division operating income decreased as a result of decreased revenue and higher sales and marketing expenses. sales and marketing expenses increased $182 million or 6%, reflecting increased advertising of windows and windows live.  server and tools  \u00a0  server and tools develops and markets technology and related services that enable information technology professionals and their systems to be more productive and efficient. server and tools product and service offerings include windows server, microsoft sql server, windows azure, visual studio, system center products, windows embedded device platforms, and enterprise services. enterprise services comprise premier product support services and microsoft consulting services. we also offer developer tools, training, and certification. approximately 55% of server and tools revenue comes primarily from multi-year volume licensing agreements, approximately 25% is purchased through transactional volume licensing programs, retail packaged product and licenses sold to oems, and the remainder comes from enterprise services.  fiscal year 2012 compared with fiscal year 2011  server and tools revenue increased in both product sales and enterprise services. product revenue increased $1.4 billion or 11%, driven primarily by growth in sql server, windows server, and system center, reflecting continued adoption of the windows platform. enterprise services revenue grew $595 million or 18%, due to growth in both premier product support and consulting services.  server and tools operating income increased primarily due to revenue growth, offset in part by higher costs of providing products and services and increased sales and marketing expenses. cost of revenue increased $682 million or 22%, primarily reflecting higher enterprise services headcount-related costs. sales and marketing expenses grew $155 million or 4%, reflecting increased corporate marketing activities.  \u00a0 28  table of contents  \u00a0 part ii  item 7  \u00a0 fiscal year 2011 compared with fiscal year 2010  server and tools revenue increased in both product sales and enterprise services. product revenue increased $1.2 billion or 10%, driven primarily by growth in windows server, sql server, and system center, reflecting continued adoption of the windows platform. enterprise services revenue grew $353 million or 12%, due to growth in both premier product support and consulting services.  server and tools operating income increased due to revenue growth, offset in part by higher operating expenses. cost of revenue increased $377 million or 13%, primarily reflecting a $323 million increase in expenses from providing enterprise services. sales and marketing expenses increased $270 million or 7%, reflecting increased fees paid to third-party enterprise software advisors and increased corporate marketing activities.  online services division  \u00a0  \u00a0 online services division (\u0093osd\u0094) develops and markets information and content designed to help people simplify tasks and make more informed decisions online, and that help advertisers connect with audiences. osd offerings include bing, msn, adcenter, and advertiser tools. bing and msn generate revenue through the sale of search and display advertising, accounting for nearly all of osd\u0092s annual revenue.  fiscal year 2012 compared with fiscal year 2011  online advertising revenue grew $306 million or 13% to $2.6 billion, reflecting continued growth in search advertising revenue, offset in part by decreased display advertising revenue. search revenue grew due to increased revenue per search, increased volumes reflecting general market growth, and share gains in the u.s. according to third-party sources, bing organic u.s. market share for the month of june 2012 was approximately 16%, and grew 120 basis points year over year. bing-powered u.s. market share, including yahoo! properties, was approximately 26% for the month of june 2012, down 100 basis points year over year.  osd\u0092s fiscal year 2012 operating loss reflects a goodwill impairment charge of $6.2 billion, which we recorded as a result of our annual goodwill impairment test in the fourth quarter. the non-cash, non-tax-deductible charge related mainly to goodwill acquired through our 2007 acquisition of aquantive, inc. while the search business has been improving, our expectations for future growth and profitability for osd are lower than our previous estimates. we do not expect this impairment charge to affect osd\u0092s ongoing business or financial performance.  excluding the $6.2 billion goodwill impairment charge, osd\u0092s operating loss was reduced by higher revenue and lower sales and marketing expenses and cost of revenue. sales and marketing expenses decreased $321 million or 29%, due mainly to lower marketing spend. cost of revenue decreased $213 million, driven by lower yahoo! reimbursement costs, amortization, and online operating costs.  fiscal year 2011 compared with fiscal year 2010  osd revenue increased primarily as a result of growth in online advertising revenue. online advertising revenue grew $351 million or 18% to $2.3 billion, reflecting continued growth in search and display advertising revenue, offset in part by decreased third-party advertising revenue. search revenue grew due to increased volumes reflecting general market growth, share gains in the u.s., and our yahoo! alliance, offset in part by decreased revenue per search primarily related to challenges associated with optimizing the adcenter platform for the new mix and volume  \u00a0 29  table of contents  \u00a0 part ii  item 7  \u00a0  of traffic from the combined yahoo! and bing properties. according to third-party sources, bing organic u.s. market share for the month of june 2011 was approximately 14%, and grew 170 basis points year over year. bing-powered u.s. market share, including yahoo! properties, was approximately 27% for the month of june 2011.  osd operating loss increased due to higher operating expenses, offset in part by increased revenue. cost of revenue grew $647 million driven by costs associated with the yahoo! search agreement and increased traffic acquisition costs. general and administrative expenses decreased $156 million or 58%, due mainly to transition expenses in the prior year associated with the inception of the yahoo! commercial agreement. research and development increased $123 million or 11% due to increased headcount-related costs.  microsoft business division  \u00a0  microsoft business division (\u0093mbd\u0094) develops and markets software and online services designed to increase personal, team, and organization productivity. mbd offerings include the microsoft office system (comprising mainly office, sharepoint, exchange, lync, and office 365), which generates over 90% of mbd revenue, and microsoft dynamics business solutions. we evaluate mbd results based upon the nature of the end user in two primary parts: business revenue, which includes microsoft office system revenue generated through volume licensing agreements and microsoft dynamics revenue; and consumer revenue, which includes revenue from retail packaged product sales and oem revenue.  fiscal year 2012 compared with fiscal year 2011  mbd revenue increased primarily reflecting sales of the 2010 microsoft office system. business revenue increased $1.7\u00a0billion or 9%, primarily reflecting growth in multi-year volume licensing revenue, licensing of the 2010 microsoft office system to transactional business customers, and an 11% increase in microsoft dynamics revenue. consumer revenue decreased $195 million or 4% due to the recognition of $254 million of revenue in the prior year associated with the office deferral. excluding the fiscal year 2011 impact associated with the office deferral, consumer revenue increased $59 million, driven by increased sales of the 2010 microsoft office system.  mbd revenue for the year ended june\u00a030, 2012 included a favorable foreign currency impact of $506 million.  mbd operating income increased, primarily due to revenue growth, offset in part by higher operating expenses. cost of revenue increased $258 million or 16%, primarily due to higher online operation and support costs. research and development expenses increased, due mainly to an increase in headcount-related costs.  fiscal year 2011 compared with fiscal year 2010  mbd revenue increased primarily reflecting sales of the 2010 microsoft office system, the $254 million office deferral during fiscal year 2010, and the subsequent recognition of the office deferral during fiscal year 2011. business revenue increased $2.1\u00a0billion or 14%, reflecting licensing of the 2010 microsoft office system to transactional business customers, growth in multi-year volume licensing revenue, and a 10% increase in microsoft dynamics revenue. consumer revenue increased $1.1 billion or 33%, approximately half of which was attributable to the launch of office 2010 and half of which was attributable to the office deferral during fiscal year 2010 and subsequent recognition of the office deferral during fiscal year 2011. excluding the impact associated with the office deferral, consumer revenue increased $617 million or 17% due to sales of the 2010 microsoft office system.  mbd operating income increased due mainly to revenue growth, offset in part by higher operating expenses. cost of revenue increased $328 million or 25%, primarily driven by higher online operation and support costs. sales and  \u00a0 30  table of contents  \u00a0 part ii  item 7  \u00a0  marketing expenses increased, primarily driven by an increase in corporate and cross-platform marketing activities. research and development costs increased, primarily as a result of capitalization of certain microsoft office system software development costs in the prior year.  entertainment and devices division  \u00a0  entertainment and devices division (\u0093edd\u0094) develops and markets products and services designed to entertain and connect people. edd offerings include the xbox 360 entertainment platform (which includes the xbox 360 gaming and entertainment console, kinect for xbox 360, xbox 360 video games, xbox live, and xbox 360 accessories), mediaroom (our internet protocol television software), skype, and windows phone, including related patent licensing revenue. in november 2010, we released kinect for xbox 360. we acquired skype on october\u00a013, 2011, and its results of operations from that date are reflected in our results discussed below.  fiscal year 2012 compared with fiscal year 2011  edd revenue increased primarily reflecting skype and windows phone revenue, offset in part by lower xbox 360 platform revenue. xbox 360 platform revenue decreased $113 million, due mainly to decreased volumes of kinect for xbox 360 sold and lower video game revenue, offset in part by higher xbox live revenue. we shipped 13.0\u00a0million xbox 360 consoles during fiscal year 2012, compared with 13.7\u00a0million xbox 360 consoles during fiscal year 2011. video game revenue decreased due to strong sales of halo reach in the prior year.  edd operating income decreased reflecting higher operating expenses, offset in part by revenue growth. cost of revenue grew $900 million or 16%, primarily due to changes in the mix of products and services sold and payments made to nokia related to joint strategic initiatives. research and development expenses increased $356 million or 30%, primarily reflecting higher headcount-related expenses. sales and marketing expenses increased $244 million or 28%, primarily reflecting the inclusion of skype expenses.  fiscal year 2011 compared with fiscal year 2010  edd revenue increased primarily reflecting higher xbox 360 platform revenue.

consoles during fiscal year 2011, compared with 10.3\u00a0million xbox 360 consoles during fiscal year 2010.  edd operating income increased primarily reflecting revenue growth, offset in part by higher cost of revenue. cost of revenue increased $1.8 billion or 49%, primarily reflecting higher volumes of xbox 360 consoles and kinect for xbox 360 sold, and increased royalty costs resulting from increased sales of xbox live digital content. research and development expenses increased $160 million or 15%, primarily reflecting higher headcount-related costs. sales and marketing expenses grew $112 million or 15%, primarily reflecting increased xbox 360 platform marketing activities.  corporate-level activity  \u00a0  \u00a0 31  table of contents  \u00a0 part ii  item 7  \u00a0 certain corporate-level activity is not allocated to our segments, including costs of: broad-based sales and marketing; product support services; human resources; legal; finance; information technology; corporate development and procurement activities; research and development; and legal settlements and contingencies.  fiscal year 2012 compared with fiscal year 2011  corporate-level expenses increased due mainly to full year puerto rican excise taxes, higher headcount-related expenses, and changes in foreign currency exchange rates. these increases were offset in part by lower legal charges, which were $56 million in fiscal year 2012 compared with $332 million in fiscal year 2011.  fiscal year 2011 compared with fiscal year 2010  corporate-level expenses increased due mainly to new puerto rican excise taxes, certain revenue related sales and marketing expenses, and increased headcount-related expenses. these increases were offset in part by lower legal charges, which were $332 million in fiscal year 2011 compared with $533 million in fiscal year 2010.  operating expenses  cost of revenue  \u00a0  cost of revenue includes: manufacturing and distribution costs for products sold and programs licensed; operating costs related to product support service centers and product distribution centers; costs incurred to include software on pcs sold by oems, to drive traffic to our websites, and to acquire online advertising space (\u0093traffic acquisition costs\u0094); costs incurred to support and maintain internet-based products and services including royalties; warranty costs; inventory valuation adjustments; costs associated with the delivery of consulting services; and the amortization of capitalized research and development costs.  fiscal year 2012 compared with fiscal year 2011  cost of revenue increased reflecting higher headcount-related costs, payments made to nokia, and changes in the mix of products and services sold. headcount-related expenses increased 20%, primarily related to increased enterprise services headcount.  fiscal year 2011 compared with fiscal year 2010  cost of revenue increased primarily due to increased volumes of xbox 360 consoles and kinect for xbox 360 sold, higher costs associated with our online offerings, including traffic acquisition costs, and higher expenses from providing enterprise services, as well as royalty costs relating to xbox live digital content sold.  research and development  \u00a0  \u00a0 32  table of contents  \u00a0 part ii  item 7  \u00a0 research and development expenses include payroll, employee benefits, stock-based compensation expense, and other headcount-related expenses associated with product development. research and development expenses also include third-party development and programming costs, localization costs incurred to translate software for international markets, and the amortization of purchased software code and services content.  fiscal year 2012 compared with fiscal year 2011  research and development expenses increased, primarily reflecting a 10% increase in headcount-related expenses.  fiscal year 2011 compared with fiscal year 2010  research and development expenses increased primarily due to a 5% increase in headcount-related expenses and the capitalization of certain software development costs in the prior year.  sales and marketing  \u00a0  sales and marketing expenses include payroll, employee benefits, stock-based compensation expense, and other headcount-related expenses associated with sales and marketing personnel and the costs of advertising, promotions, trade shows, seminars, and other programs.  fiscal year 2012 compared with fiscal year 2011  sales and marketing expenses decreased slightly, primarily reflecting decreased advertising and marketing of the xbox 360 platform, windows phone, and bing, offset in part by a 5% increase in headcount-related expenses.  fiscal year 2011 compared with fiscal year 2010  sales and marketing expenses increased, primarily as a result of increased advertising and marketing of the xbox 360 platform, windows phone, and windows and windows live, a 5% increase in headcount-related expenses, and increased fees paid to third-party enterprise software advisors.  general and administrative  \u00a0  general and administrative expenses include payroll, employee benefits, stock-based compensation expense, severance expense, and other headcount-related expenses associated with finance, legal, facilities, certain human resources and other administrative personnel, certain taxes, and legal and other administrative fees.  fiscal year 2012 compared with fiscal year 2011  general and administrative expenses increased, primarily due to a 10% increase in headcount-related expenses and a full year of puerto rican excise taxes, offset in part by a decrease in legal charges.  \u00a0 33  table of contents  \u00a0 part ii  item 7  \u00a0 fiscal year 2011 compared with fiscal year 2010  general and administrative expenses increased, primarily due to a 12% increase in headcount-related expenses and new puerto rican excise taxes, partially offset by prior year transition expenses associated with the inception of the yahoo! commercial agreement.  goodwill impairment  we conducted our annual goodwill impairment test as of may\u00a01, 2012 for all reporting units. this test, which was based on our most recent cash flow forecast, indicated that osd\u0092s carrying value exceeded its estimated fair value. accordingly, we recorded a non-cash, non-tax deductible goodwill impairment charge of $6.2 billion during the three months ended june\u00a030, 2012, reducing osd\u0092s goodwill from $6.4 billion to $223 million.  other income (expense) and income taxes  other income (expense)  the components of other income (expense) were as follows:  \u00a0 we use derivative instruments to manage risks related to foreign currencies, equity prices, interest rates, and credit; to enhance investment returns; and to facilitate portfolio diversification. gains and losses from changes in fair values of derivatives that are not designated as hedges are recognized in other income (expense). these are generally offset by unrealized gains and losses in the underlying securities in the investment portfolio and are recorded as a component of other comprehensive income.  fiscal year 2012 compared with fiscal year 2011  dividends and interest income decreased due to lower yields on our fixed-income investments, offset in part by higher average portfolio investment balances. interest expense increased due to our increased issuance of debt in the prior year. net recognized gains on investments increased, primarily due to higher gains on sales of equity and fixed-income securities and a gain recognized on the partial sale of our facebook holding upon the initial public offering on may\u00a018, 2012, offset in part by higher other-than-temporary impairments. other-than-temporary impairments were $298 million in fiscal year 2012, compared with $80 million in fiscal year 2011. net losses on derivatives increased due to losses on commodity and equity derivatives in the current fiscal year as compared with gains in the prior fiscal year, offset in part by fewer losses on foreign exchange contracts in the current fiscal year as compared to the prior fiscal year. changes in foreign currency remeasurements were primarily due to currency movements net of our hedging activities.  fiscal year 2011 compared with fiscal year 2010  dividends and interest income increased due to higher average portfolio investment balances, offset in part by lower yields on our fixed-income investments. interest expense increased due to our increased issuance of debt. net  \u00a0 34  table of contents  \u00a0 part ii  item 7  \u00a0  recognized gains on investments increased, primarily due to higher gains on sales of equity securities, offset in part by fewer gains on sales of fixed-income securities. derivative losses decreased, primarily due to higher gains on commodity derivatives offset in part by higher losses on currency contracts used to hedge foreign currency revenue.  income taxes  fiscal year 2012 compared with fiscal year 2011  our effective tax rates for fiscal years 2012 and 2011 were approximately 24% and 18%, respectively. our effective tax rates were lower than the u.s. federal statutory rate primarily due to earnings taxed at lower rates in foreign jurisdictions resulting from producing and distributing our products and services through our foreign regional operations centers in ireland, singapore, and puerto rico, which have lower income tax rates.  our fiscal year 2012 effective rate increased by 6% from fiscal year 2011 mainly due to a nonrecurring $6.2 billion non-tax deductible goodwill impairment charge that was recorded in the fourth quarter of 2012. the goodwill impairment charge increased our effective tax rate by 10%. in addition, in fiscal years 2012 and 2011, we recognized a reduction of 21% and 16%, respectively, to the effective tax rate due to foreign earnings taxed at lower rates. in fiscal year 2011, we settled a portion of an i.r.s. audit of tax years 2004 to 2006, which reduced our income tax expense for fiscal year 2011 by $461 million and reduced the effective tax rate by 2%.  changes in the mix of income before income taxes between the u.s. and foreign countries also impacted our effective tax rates and resulted primarily from changes in the geographic distribution of and changes in consumer demand for our products and services. as discussed above, windows division operating income declined $751 million in fiscal year 2012, while mbd and server and tools operating income increased $1.1 billion and $1.1 billion, respectively, during this same period. we supply windows, our primary windows division product, to customers through our u.s. regional operating center, while we supply the microsoft office system, our primary mbd product, and our server and tools products to customers through our foreign regional operations centers. in fiscal years 2012 and 2011, our u.s. income before income taxes was $1.6 billion and $8.9 billion, respectively, and comprised 7% and 32%, respectively, of our income before income taxes. in fiscal years 2012 and 2011, the foreign income before income taxes was $20.7 billion and $19.2 billion, respectively, and comprised 93% and 68%, respectively, of our income before income taxes. the primary driver for the decrease in the u.s. income before income tax in fiscal year 2012 was the goodwill impairment charge.  tax contingencies and other tax liabilities were $7.6 billion and $7.4 billion as of june\u00a030, 2012 and 2011, respectively, and are included in other long-term liabilities. while we settled a portion of the i.r.s. audit for tax years 2004 to 2006 during the third quarter of fiscal year 2011, we remain under audit for these years. in february 2012, the i.r.s. withdrew its 2011 revenue agents report and reopened the audit phase of the examination. as of june\u00a030, 2012, the primary unresolved issue relates to transfer pricing which could have a significant impact on our financial statements if not resolved favorably. we believe our allowances for tax contingencies are appropriate. we do not believe it is reasonably possible that the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits will significantly increase or decrease within the next 12 months, as we do not believe the remaining open issues will be resolved within the next 12 months. we also continue to be subject to examination by the i.r.s. for tax years 2007 to 2011.  fiscal year 2011 compared with fiscal year 2010  our effective tax rates for fiscal years 2011 and 2010 were approximately 18% and 25%, respectively. our effective tax rate was lower than the u.s. federal statutory rate and our prior year effective rate primarily due to a higher mix of earnings taxed at lower rates in foreign jurisdictions resulting from producing and distributing our products and services through our foreign regional operations centers in ireland, singapore, and puerto rico, which have lower income tax rates. in fiscal years 2011 and 2010, our u.s. income before income taxes was $8.9 billion\u00a0and $9.6 billion, respectively, and comprised 32% and 38%, respectively, of our income before income taxes.\u00a0in fiscal years 2011 and 2010, the foreign income before income taxes was $19.2 billion and $15.4 billion, respectively, and comprised 68% and 62%, respectively, of our income before income taxes. in fiscal years 2011 and 2010, the reduction of the u.s. federal statutory rate as a result of foreign earnings taxed at lower rates was 16% and 12%, respectively.  \u00a0 35  table of contents  \u00a0 part ii  item 7  \u00a0 in addition, our effective tax rate was lower than in the prior year due to a partial settlement with the i.r.s. in the third quarter of fiscal year 2011 relating to the audit of tax years 2004 to 2006. this partial settlement reduced our income tax expense for fiscal year 2011 by $461 million.  financial condition  cash, cash equivalents, and investments  cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments totaled $63.0 billion as of june\u00a030, 2012, compared with $52.8 billion as of june\u00a030, 2011. equity and other investments were $9.8 billion as of june\u00a030, 2012, compared with $10.9 billion as of june\u00a030, 2011. our short-term investments are primarily to facilitate liquidity and for capital preservation. they consist predominantly of highly liquid investment-grade fixed-income securities, diversified among industries and individual issuers. the investments are predominantly u.s. dollar-denominated securities, but also include foreign currency-denominated securities in order to diversify risk. our fixed-income investments are exposed to interest rate risk and credit risk. the credit risk and average maturity of our fixed-income portfolio are managed to achieve economic returns that correlate to certain fixed-income indices. the settlement risk related to these investments is insignificant given that the short-term investments held are primarily highly liquid investment-grade fixed-income securities. while we own certain mortgage-backed and asset-backed fixed-income securities, our portfolio as of june\u00a030, 2012 does not contain direct exposure to subprime mortgages or structured vehicles that derive their value from subprime collateral. the majority of our mortgage-backed securities are collateralized by prime residential mortgages and carry a 100% principal and interest guarantee, primarily from federal national mortgage association, federal home loan mortgage corporation, and government national mortgage association.  we routinely monitor our financial exposure to both sovereign and non-sovereign borrowers and counterparties. our gross exposures to our customers and investments in portugal, italy, ireland, greece, and spain are individually and collectively not material.  of the cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments at june\u00a030, 2012, approximately $54 billion was held by our foreign subsidiaries and would be subject to material repatriation tax effects. the amount of cash and investments held by foreign subsidiaries subject to other restrictions on the free flow of funds (primarily currency and other local regulatory) was approximately $660 million. as of june\u00a030, 2012, approximately 77% of the short-term investments held by our foreign subsidiaries were invested in u.s. government and agency securities, approximately 10% were invested in corporate notes and bonds of u.s. companies, and 3% were invested in u.s. mortgage-backed securities, all of which are denominated in u.s. dollars.  securities lending  we lend certain fixed-income and equity securities to increase investment returns. the loaned securities continue to be carried as investments on our balance sheet. cash and/or security interests are received as collateral for the loaned securities with the amount determined based upon the underlying security lent and the creditworthiness of the borrower. cash received is recorded as an asset with a corresponding liability. our securities lending payable balance was $814 million as of june\u00a030, 2012. our average and maximum securities lending payable balances for the fiscal year were $1.2 billion and $1.4 billion, respectively. intra-year variances in the amount of securities loaned are mainly due to fluctuations in the demand for the securities.  valuation  in general, and where applicable, we use quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities to determine the fair value of our financial instruments. this pricing methodology applies to our level 1 investments, such as exchange-traded mutual funds, domestic and international equities, and u.s. treasuries. if quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities are not available to determine fair value, then we use quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities or inputs other than the quoted prices that are observable either directly or indirectly. this pricing methodology applies to our level 2 investments such as corporate notes and bonds, foreign government  \u00a0 36  table of contents  \u00a0 part ii  item 7  \u00a0  bonds, mortgage-backed securities, and agency securities. level 3 investments are valued using internally developed models with unobservable inputs. assets and liabilities measured using unobservable inputs are an immaterial portion of our portfolio.  a majority of our investments are priced by pricing vendors and are generally level 1 or level 2 investments as these vendors either provide a quoted market price in an active market or use observable inputs for their pricing without applying significant adjustments. broker pricing is used mainly when a quoted price is not available, the investment is not priced by our pricing vendors, or when a broker price is more reflective of fair values in the market in which the investment trades. our broker-priced investments are generally labeled as level 2 investments because the broker prices these investments based on similar assets without applying significant adjustments. in addition, all of our broker-priced investments have a sufficient level of trading volume to demonstrate that the fair values used are appropriate for these investments. our fair value processes include controls that are designed to ensure appropriate fair values are recorded. these controls include model validation, review of key model inputs, analysis of period-over-period fluctuations, and independent recalculation of prices where appropriate.  cash flows  fiscal year 2012 compared with fiscal year 2011  cash flows from operations increased $4.6 billion during the current fiscal year to $31.6 billion due mainly to increased revenue and cash collections from customers. cash used for financing increased $1.0 billion to $9.4 billion due mainly to a $6.0 billion net decrease in proceeds from issuances of debt and a $1.2 billion increase in dividends paid, offset in part by a $6.5 billion decrease in cash used for common stock repurchases. cash used in investing increased $10.2 billion to $24.8 billion due mainly to a $10.0 billion increase in acquisitions of businesses and purchases of intangible assets and a $1.4 billion decrease in cash from securities lending activities, partially offset by a $1.2 billion decrease in cash used for net purchases, maturities, and sales of investments.  fiscal year 2011 compared with fiscal year 2010  cash flows from operations increased $2.9 billion during the current fiscal year to $27.0 billion due mainly to increased revenue and cash collections from customers. cash used in financing decreased $4.9 billion to $8.4 billion due mainly to a $5.8 billion increase in proceeds from issuance of debt, net of repayments, offset in part by a $602 million increase in cash paid for dividends. cash used in investing increased $3.3 billion to $14.6 billion due to a $5.8 billion increase in purchases of investments, offset in part by a $2.5 billion increase in cash from securities lending.  debt  we issued debt in prior periods to take advantage of favorable pricing and liquidity in the debt markets, reflecting our credit rating and the low interest rate environment. the proceeds of these issuances were used to partially fund discretionary business acquisitions and share repurchases.  as of june\u00a030, 2012, the total carrying value and estimated fair value of our long-term debt, including the current portion, were $11.9 billion and $13.2 billion, respectively. this is compared with a carrying value and estimated fair value of $11.9 billion and $12.1 billion, respectively, as of june\u00a030, 2011. these estimated fair values are based on level\u00a02 inputs.  \u00a0 37  table of contents  \u00a0 part ii  item 7  \u00a0 the components of our long-term debt, including the current portion, and the associated interest rates and semi-annual interest record and payment dates were as follows as of june\u00a030, 2012:  \u00a0 as of june\u00a030, 2012, the aggregate unamortized discount for our long-term debt, including the current portion, was $56 million.  notes  the notes are senior unsecured obligations and rank equally with our other unsecured and unsubordinated debt outstanding.  convertible debt  in june 2010, we issued $1.25 billion of zero coupon convertible unsecured debt due on june\u00a015, 2013 in a private placement offering. proceeds from the offering were $1.24 billion, net of fees and expenses, which were capitalized. initially, each $1,000 principal amount of notes was convertible into 29.94 shares of microsoft common stock at a conversion price of $33.40 per share. the conversion ratio is adjusted periodically for dividends in excess of the initial dividend threshold as defined in the debt agreement. as of june\u00a030, 2012, the net carrying amount of our convertible debt was $1.2 billion and the unamortized discount was $19 million.  prior to march\u00a015, 2013, the notes will be convertible, only in certain circumstances, into cash and, if applicable, cash, shares of microsoft\u0092s common stock, or a combination thereof, at our election. on or after march\u00a015, 2013, the notes will be convertible at any time. upon conversion, we will pay cash up to the aggregate principal amount of the notes and pay or deliver cash, shares of our common stock, or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock, at our election.  because the convertible debt may be wholly or partially settled in cash, we are required to separately account for the liability and equity components of the notes in a manner that reflects our nonconvertible debt borrowing rate when interest costs are recognized in subsequent periods. the net proceeds of $1.24 billion were allocated between debt for $1.18 billion and stockholders\u0092 equity for $58 million with the portion in stockholders\u0092 equity representing the fair value of the option to convert the debt.  in connection with the issuance of the notes, we entered into capped call transactions with certain option counterparties who are initial purchasers of the notes or their affiliates. the capped call transactions are expected to  \u00a0 38  table of contents  \u00a0 part ii  item 7  \u00a0  reduce potential dilution of earnings per share upon conversion of the notes. under the capped call transactions, we purchased from the option counterparties capped call options that in the aggregate relate to the total number of shares of our common stock underlying the notes, with a strike price equal to the conversion price of the notes and with an initial cap price equal to $37.16, which is adjusted periodically to mirror any adjustments to the conversion price. the purchased capped calls were valued at $40 million and recorded to stockholders\u0092 equity.  unearned revenue  unearned revenue at june\u00a030, 2012 comprised mainly unearned revenue from volume licensing programs. unearned revenue from volume licensing programs represents customer billings for multi-year licensing arrangements paid for either at inception of the agreement or annually at the beginning of each billing coverage period and accounted for as subscriptions with revenue recognized ratably over the billing coverage period. unearned revenue at june\u00a030, 2012 also included payments for: post-delivery support and consulting services to be performed in the future; xbox live subscriptions and prepaid points; the windows upgrade offer; microsoft dynamics business solutions products; skype prepaid credits and subscriptions; oem minimum commitments; and other offerings for which we have been paid in advance and earn the revenue when we provide the service or software, or otherwise meet the revenue recognition criteria.  the following table outlines the expected future recognition of unearned revenue as of june\u00a030, 2012:  \u00a0 share repurchases  on september\u00a022, 2008, we announced that our board of directors approved a new share repurchase program authorizing up to $40.0 billion in share repurchases with an expiration date of september\u00a030, 2013. as of june\u00a030, 2012, approximately $8.2 billion remained of the $40.0 billion approved repurchase amount. the repurchase program may be suspended or discontinued at any time without notice.  during the periods reported, we repurchased with cash resources: 142\u00a0million shares for $4.0 billion during fiscal year 2012; 447\u00a0million shares for $11.5 billion during fiscal year 2011; and 380\u00a0million shares for $10.8 billion during fiscal year 2010.  dividends  during fiscal years 2012 and 2011, our board of directors declared the following dividends:  \u00a0  \u00a0 39  table of contents  \u00a0 part ii  item 7  \u00a0 off-balance sheet arrangements  we provide indemnifications of varying scope and size to certain customers against claims of intellectual property infringement made by third parties arising from the use of our products and certain other matters. in evaluating estimated losses on these indemnifications, we consider factors such as the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and our ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss. to date, we have not encountered significant costs as a result of these obligations and have not accrued in our financial statements any liabilities related to these indemnifications.  contractual obligations  the following table summarizes the payments due by fiscal year for our outstanding contractual obligations as of june\u00a030, 2012:  \u00a0 \u00a0 other planned uses of capital  on july\u00a018, 2012, we acquired yammer, inc. (\u0093yammer\u0094), a leading provider of enterprise social networks, for $1.2 billion in cash. yammer will continue to develop its standalone service and will add an enterprise social networking service to microsoft\u0092s portfolio of complementary cloud-based services.  we will continue to invest in sales, marketing, product support infrastructure, and existing and advanced areas of technology. additions to property and equipment will continue, including new facilities, data centers, and computer systems for research and development, sales and marketing, support, and administrative staff. we have operating leases for most u.s. and international sales and support offices and certain equipment. we have not engaged in any related party transactions or arrangements with unconsolidated entities or other persons that are reasonably likely to materially affect liquidity or the availability of capital resources.  liquidity  we earn a significant amount of our operating income outside the u.s., which is deemed to be permanently reinvested in foreign jurisdictions. as a result, as discussed above under cash, cash equivalents, and investments,  \u00a0 40  table of contents  \u00a0 part ii  item 7  \u00a0  the majority of our cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments are held by foreign subsidiaries. we currently do not intend nor foresee a need to repatriate these funds. we expect existing domestic cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, and cash flows from operations to continue to be sufficient to fund our domestic operating activities and cash commitments for investing and financing activities, such as regular quarterly dividends, debt repayment schedules, and material capital expenditures, for at least the next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future. in addition, we expect existing foreign cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, and cash flows from operations to continue to be sufficient to fund our foreign operating activities and cash commitments for investing activities, such as material capital expenditures, for at least the next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future.  should we require more capital in the u.s. than is generated by our operations domestically, for example to fund significant discretionary activities, such as business acquisitions and share repurchases, we could elect to repatriate future earnings from foreign jurisdictions or raise capital in the u.s. through debt or equity issuances. these alternatives could result in higher effective tax rates, increased interest expense, or dilution of our earnings. we have borrowed funds domestically and continue to believe we have the ability to do so at reasonable interest rates.  recent accounting guidance  recently adopted accounting guidance  on july\u00a01, 2011, we adopted guidance issued by the financial accounting standards board (\u0093fasb\u0094) on disclosure requirements related to fair value measurements.\u00a0the guidance requires the disclosure of roll-forward activities on purchases, sales, issuances, and settlements of the assets and liabilities measured using significant unobservable inputs (level 3 fair value measurements).\u00a0adoption of this new guidance did not have a material impact on our financial statements.  on january\u00a01, 2012, we adopted guidance issued by the fasb on accounting and disclosure requirements related to fair value measurements.\u00a0the guidance limits the highest-and-best-use measure to nonfinancial assets, permits certain financial assets and liabilities with offsetting positions in market or counterparty credit risks to be measured at a net basis, and provides guidance on the applicability of premiums and discounts.\u00a0additionally, the guidance expands the disclosures on level 3 inputs by requiring quantitative disclosure of the unobservable inputs and assumptions, as well as description of the valuation processes and the sensitivity of the fair value to changes in unobservable inputs.\u00a0adoption of this new guidance did not have a material impact on our financial statements.  recent accounting guidance not yet adopted  in december 2011, the fasb issued guidance enhancing disclosure requirements about the nature of an entity\u0092s right to offset and related arrangements associated with its financial instruments and derivative instruments. the new guidance requires the disclosure of the gross amounts subject to rights of set-off, amounts offset in accordance with the accounting standards followed, and the related net exposure. the new guidance will be effective for us beginning july\u00a01, 2013. other than requiring additional disclosures, we do not anticipate material impacts on our financial statements upon adoption.  in september 2011, the fasb issued guidance on testing goodwill for impairment. the new guidance provides an entity the option to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. if an entity determines that this is the case, it is required to perform the currently prescribed two-step goodwill impairment test to identify potential goodwill impairment and measure the amount of goodwill impairment loss to be recognized for that reporting unit (if any). if an entity determines that the fair value of a reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount, the two-step goodwill impairment test is not required. the new guidance will be effective for us beginning july\u00a01, 2012.  in june 2011, the fasb issued guidance on presentation of comprehensive income.\u00a0the new guidance eliminates the current option to report other comprehensive income and its components in the statement of changes in stockholders\u0092 equity.\u00a0instead, an entity will be required to present either a continuous statement of net income and  \u00a0 41  table of contents  \u00a0 part ii  item 7  \u00a0  other comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements.\u00a0this portion of the guidance will be effective for us beginning july\u00a01, 2012 and will require financial statement presentation changes only. the new guidance also required entities to present reclassification adjustments out of accumulated other comprehensive income by component in both the statement in which net income is presented and the statement in which other comprehensive income is presented. however, in december 2011, the fasb issued guidance that indefinitely defers the guidance related to the presentation of reclassification adjustments.  application of critical accounting policies  our financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with u.s. gaap. preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. these estimates and assumptions are affected by management\u0092s application of accounting policies. critical accounting policies for us include revenue recognition, impairment of investment securities, goodwill, research and development costs, contingencies, income taxes, and stock-based compensation.  revenue recognition  software revenue recognition requires judgment, including whether a software arrangement includes multiple elements, and if so, whether vendor-specific objective evidence (\u0093vsoe\u0094) of fair value exists for those elements. a portion of revenue may be recorded as unearned due to undelivered elements. changes to the elements in a software arrangement, the ability to identify vsoe for those elements, and the fair value of the respective elements could materially impact the amount of earned and unearned revenue. judgment is also required to assess whether future releases of certain software represent new products or upgrades and enhancements to existing products.  windows 7 revenue is subject to deferral as a result of the windows upgrade offer, which started june\u00a02, 2012. the offer provides significantly discounted rights to purchase windows 8 pro to qualifying end users that purchase windows 7 pcs during the eligibility period. microsoft is responsible for delivering windows 8 pro to the end customer. accordingly, revenue related to the allocated discount for undelivered windows 8 is deferred until it is delivered or the redemption period expires.  impairment of investment securities  we review investments quarterly for indicators of other-than-temporary impairment. this determination requires significant judgment. in making this judgment, we employ a systematic methodology quarterly that considers available quantitative and qualitative evidence in evaluating potential impairment of our investments. if the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value, we evaluate, among other factors, general market conditions, credit quality of debt instrument issuers, the duration and extent to which the fair value is less than cost, and for equity securities, our intent and ability to hold, or plans to sell, the investment. for fixed-income securities, we also evaluate whether we have plans to sell the security or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery. we also consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of and business outlook for the investee, including industry and sector performance, changes in technology, and operational and financing cash flow factors. once a decline in fair value is determined to be other-than-temporary, an impairment charge is recorded to other income (expense) and a new cost basis in the investment is established. if market, industry, and/or investee conditions deteriorate, we may incur future impairments.  goodwill  we allocate goodwill to reporting units based on the reporting unit expected to benefit from the business combination. we evaluate our reporting units on an annual basis and, if necessary, reassign goodwill using a relative fair value allocation approach. goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level (operating segment or one level below an operating segment) on an annual basis (may 1 for us) and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. these events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate, legal factors, operating performance indicators, competition, or sale or disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit.  \u00a0 42  table of contents  \u00a0 part ii  item 7  \u00a0 application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment, including the identification of reporting units, assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units, assignment of goodwill to reporting units, and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit. the fair value of each reporting unit is estimated using a discounted cash flow methodology. this analysis requires significant judgments, including estimation of future cash flows, which is dependent on internal forecasts, estimation of the long-term rate of growth for our business, estimation of the useful life over which cash flows will occur, and determination of our weighted average cost of capital.  the estimates used to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit change from year to year based on operating results, market conditions, and other factors. changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and goodwill impairment for each reporting unit.  research and development costs  costs incurred internally in researching and developing a computer software product are charged to expense until technological feasibility has been established for the product. once technological feasibility is established, all software costs are capitalized until the product is available for general release to customers. judgment is required in determining when technological feasibility of a product is established. we have determined that technological feasibility for our software products is reached after all high-risk development issues have been resolved through coding and testing. generally, this occurs shortly before the products are released to manufacturing. the amortization of these costs is included in cost of revenue over the estimated life of the products.  legal and other contingencies  the outcomes of legal proceedings and claims brought against us are subject to significant uncertainty. an estimated loss from a loss contingency such as a legal proceeding or claim is accrued by a charge to income if it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. disclosure of a contingency is required if there is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss has been incurred. in determining whether a loss should be accrued we evaluate, among other factors, the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss. changes in these factors could materially impact our financial statements.  income taxes  the objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entity\u0092s financial statements or tax returns. we recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. accounting literature also provides guidance on derecognition of income tax assets and liabilities, classification of current and deferred income tax assets and liabilities, accounting for interest and penalties associated with tax positions, and income tax disclosures. judgment is required in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns. variations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could materially impact our financial statements.  stock-based compensation  stock-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense, net of estimated forfeitures, over the requisite service period. determining the fair value of stock-based awards at the grant date requires judgment, including estimating expected dividends. in addition, judgment is also required in estimating the amount of stock-based awards that are expected to be forfeited. if actual results differ significantly from these estimates, stock-based compensation expense and our results of operations could be impacted.  \u00a0 43  table of contents  \u00a0 part ii  item 7  \u00a0 statement of management\u0092s responsibility for financial statements  management is responsible for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements and related information that are presented in this report. the consolidated financial statements, which include amounts based on management\u0092s estimates and judgments, have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america.  the company designs and maintains accounting and internal control systems to provide reasonable assurance at reasonable cost that assets are safeguarded against loss from unauthorized use or disposition, and that the financial records are reliable for preparing financial statements and maintaining accountability for assets. these systems are augmented by written policies, an organizational structure providing division of responsibilities, careful selection and training of qualified personnel, and a program of internal audits.  the company engaged deloitte\u00a0& touche llp, an independent registered public accounting firm, to audit and render an opinion on the consolidated financial statements and internal control over financial reporting in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board (united states).  the board of directors, through its audit committee, consisting solely of independent directors of the company, meets periodically with management, internal auditors, and our independent registered public accounting firm to ensure that each is meeting its responsibilities and to discuss matters concerning internal controls and financial reporting. deloitte\u00a0& touche llp and the internal auditors each have full and free access to the audit committee.  \u00a0 44  table of contents  \u00a0 part ii  item 7a  \u00a0 item\u00a07a.\u00a0quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk  risks  we are exposed to economic risk from foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, credit risk, equity prices, and commodity prices. a portion of these risks is hedged, but they may impact our financial statements.  foreign currency  certain forecasted transactions, assets, and liabilities are exposed to foreign currency risk. we monitor our foreign currency exposures daily and use hedges where practicable to offset the risks and maximize the economic effectiveness of our foreign currency positions. principal currencies hedged include the euro, japanese yen, british pound, and canadian dollar.  interest rate  our fixed-income portfolio is diversified across credit sectors and maturities, consisting primarily of investment-grade securities. the credit risk and average maturity of the fixed-income portfolio is managed to achieve economic returns that correlate to certain global and domestic fixed-income indices. in addition, we use \u0093to be announced\u0094 forward purchase commitments of mortgage-backed assets to gain exposure to agency and mortgage-backed securities.  equity  our equity portfolio consists of global, developed, and emerging market securities that are subject to market price risk.\u00a0we manage the securities relative to certain global and domestic indices and expect their economic risk and return to correlate with these indices.  commodity  we use broad-based commodity exposures to enhance portfolio returns and facilitate portfolio diversification. our investment portfolio has exposure to a variety of commodities, including precious metals, energy, and grain. we manage these exposures relative to global commodity indices and expect their economic risk and return to correlate with these indices.  value-at-risk  we use a value-at-risk (\u0093var\u0094) model to estimate and quantify our market risks. var is the expected loss, for a given confidence level, in the fair value of our portfolio due to adverse market movements over a defined time horizon. the var model is not intended to represent actual losses in fair value, including determinations of other-than-temporary losses in fair value in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states (\u0093u.s. gaap\u0094), but is used as a risk estimation and management tool. the distribution of the potential changes in total market value of all holdings is computed based on the historical volatilities and correlations among foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, equity prices, and commodity prices, assuming normal market conditions.  the var is calculated as the total loss that will not be exceeded at the 97.5 percentile confidence level or, alternatively stated, the losses could exceed the var in 25 out of 1,000 cases. several risk factors are not captured in the model, including liquidity risk, operational risk, and legal risk.  \u00a0 45  table of contents  \u00a0 part ii  item 7a  \u00a0 the following table sets forth the one-day var for substantially all of our positions as of june\u00a030, 2012 and june\u00a030, 2011 and for the year ended june\u00a030, 2012:  \u00a0  total one-day var for the combined risk categories was $292 million at june\u00a030, 2012 and $290 million at june\u00a030, 2011. the total var is 26% less at june\u00a030, 2012, and 25% less at june\u00a030, 2011, than the sum of the separate risk categories in the above table due to the diversification benefit of the combination of risks.  \u00a0 46  table of contents  \u00a0 part ii  item 8  \u00a0 stockholders\u0092 equity statements  \u00a0 see accompanying notes.  \u00a0 50  table of contents  \u00a0 part ii  item 8  \u00a0 notes to financial statements  note 1 - accounting policies  accounting principles  the financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america (\u0093u.s. gaap\u0094).  principles of consolidation  the financial statements include the accounts of microsoft corporation and its subsidiaries. intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated. equity investments through which we exercise significant influence over but do not control the investee and are not the primary beneficiary of the investee\u0092s activities are accounted for using the equity method. investments through which we are not able to exercise significant influence over the investee and which do not have readily determinable fair values are accounted for under the cost method.  estimates and assumptions  preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. examples of estimates include: loss contingencies; product warranties; the fair value of, and/or potential goodwill impairment for, our reporting units; product life cycles; useful lives of our tangible and intangible assets; allowances for doubtful accounts; allowances for product returns; and stock-based compensation forfeiture rates. examples of assumptions include: the elements comprising a software arrangement, including the distinction between upgrades or enhancements and new products; when technological feasibility is achieved for our products; the potential outcome of future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns; and determining when investment impairments are other-than-temporary. actual results and outcomes may differ from management\u0092s estimates and assumptions.  foreign currencies  assets and liabilities recorded in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rate on the balance sheet date. revenue and expenses are translated at average rates of exchange prevailing during the year. translation adjustments resulting from this process are recorded to other comprehensive income (\u0093oci\u0094).  revenue recognition  revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the fee is fixed or determinable, and collectibility is probable. revenue generally is recognized net of allowances for returns and any taxes collected from customers and subsequently remitted to governmental authorities.  revenue for retail packaged products, products licensed to original equipment manufacturers (\u0093oems\u0094), and perpetual licenses under certain volume licensing programs generally is recognized as products are shipped or made available. revenue for products under technology guarantee programs, which provide free or significantly discounted rights to use upcoming new versions of a software product if an end user licenses existing versions of the product during the eligibility period, is allocated between existing product and the new product, and revenue allocated to the new product is deferred until that version is delivered. the revenue allocation is based on vendor-specific objective evidence of fair value of the products.  certain multi-year licensing arrangements include a perpetual license for current products combined with rights to receive future versions of software products on a when-and-if-available basis (\u0093software assurance\u0094) and are accounted for as subscriptions, with billings recorded as unearned revenue and recognized as revenue ratably over the billing coverage period. revenue from certain arrangements that allow for the use of a product or service over a period of time without taking possession of software are also accounted for as subscriptions. revenue for software  \u00a0 51  table of contents  \u00a0 part ii  item 8  \u00a0  products where customers have the right to receive unspecified upgrades/enhancements on a when-and-if-available basis and for which vendor-specific objective evidence of fair value does not exist for the upgrades/enhancements is recognized on a straight-line basis over the estimated life of the software.  revenue related to our xbox 360 gaming and entertainment console, kinect for xbox 360, games published by us, and other hardware components is generally recognized when ownership is transferred to the resellers. revenue related to games published by third parties for use on the xbox 360 platform is recognized when games are manufactured by the game publishers.  display advertising revenue is recognized as advertisements are displayed. search advertising revenue is recognized when the ad appears in the search results or when the action necessary to earn the revenue has been completed. consulting services revenue is recognized as services are rendered, generally based on the negotiated hourly rate in the consulting arrangement and the number of hours worked during the period. consulting revenue for fixed-price services arrangements is recognized as services are provided. revenue from prepaid points redeemable for the purchase of software or services is recognized upon redemption of the points and delivery of the software or services.  cost of revenue  cost of revenue includes; manufacturing and distribution costs for products sold and programs licensed; operating costs related to product support service centers and product distribution centers; costs incurred to include software on pcs sold by oems, to drive traffic to our websites, and to acquire online advertising space (\u0093traffic acquisition costs\u0094); costs incurred to support and maintain internet-based products and services, including royalties; warranty costs; inventory valuation adjustments; costs associated with the delivery of consulting services; and the amortization of capitalized research and development costs. capitalized research and development costs are amortized over the estimated lives of the products.  product warranty  we provide for the estimated costs of fulfilling our obligations under hardware and software warranties at the time the related revenue is recognized. for hardware warranties, we estimate the costs based on historical and projected product failure rates, historical and projected repair costs, and knowledge of specific product failures (if any). the specific hardware warranty terms and conditions vary depending upon the product sold and the country in which we do business, but generally include parts and labor over a period generally ranging from 90\u00a0days to three years. for software warranties, we estimate the costs to provide bug fixes, such as security patches, over the estimated life of the software. we regularly reevaluate our estimates to assess the adequacy of the recorded warranty liabilities and adjust the amounts as necessary.  research and development  research and development expenses include payroll, employee benefits, stock-based compensation expense, and other headcount-related expenses associated with product development. research and development expenses also include third-party development and programming costs, localization costs incurred to translate software for international markets, and the amortization of purchased software code and services content. such costs related to software development are included in research and development expense until the point that technological feasibility is reached, which for our software products, is generally shortly before the products are released to manufacturing. once technological feasibility is reached, such costs are capitalized and amortized to cost of revenue over the estimated lives of the products.  sales and marketing  sales and marketing expenses include payroll, employee benefits, stock-based compensation expense, and other headcount-related expenses associated with sales and marketing personnel, and the costs of advertising, promotions, trade shows, seminars, and other programs. advertising costs are expensed as incurred. advertising expense was $1.6 billion, $1.9 billion, and $1.6 billion in fiscal years 2012, 2011, and 2010, respectively.  \u00a0 52  table of contents  \u00a0 part ii  item 8  \u00a0 stock-based compensation  we measure stock-based compensation cost at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and recognize it as expense, net of estimated forfeitures, over the vesting or service period, as applicable, of the stock award (generally four to five years) using the straight-line method.  employee stock purchase plan  shares of our common stock may be purchased by employees at three-month intervals at 90% of the fair market value of the stock on the last day of each three-month period. compensation expense for the employee stock purchase plan is measured as the discount the employee is entitled to upon purchase and is recognized in the period of purchase.  income taxes  income tax expense includes u.s. and international income taxes, the provision for u.s. taxes on undistributed earnings of international subsidiaries not deemed to be permanently invested, and interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions. certain income and expenses are not reported in tax returns and financial statements in the same year. the tax effect of such temporary differences is reported as deferred income taxes. deferred tax assets are reported net of a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized. the deferred income taxes are classified as current or long-term based on the classification of the related asset or liability.  fair value measurements  we account for certain assets and liabilities at fair value. the hierarchy below lists three levels of fair value based on the extent to which inputs used in measuring fair value are observable in the market.\u00a0we categorize each of our fair value measurements in one of these three levels based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. these levels are:  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 53  table of contents  \u00a0 part ii  item 8  \u00a0 we measure certain assets, including our cost and equity method investments, at fair value on a nonrecurring basis when they are deemed to be other-than-temporarily impaired. the fair values of these investments are determined based on valuation techniques using the best information available, and may include quoted market prices, market comparables, and discounted cash flow projections. an impairment charge is recorded when the cost of the investment exceeds its fair value and this condition is determined to be other-than-temporary.  our other current financial assets and our current financial liabilities have fair values that approximate their carrying values.  financial instruments  we consider all highly liquid interest-earning investments with a maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase to be cash equivalents. the fair values of these investments approximate their carrying values. in general, investments with original maturities of greater than three months and remaining maturities of less than one year are classified as short-term investments. investments with maturities beyond one year may be classified as short-term based on their highly liquid nature and because such marketable securities represent the investment of cash that is available for current operations. all cash equivalents and short-term investments are classified as available-for-sale and realized gains and losses are recorded using the specific identification method. changes in market value, excluding other-than-temporary impairments, are reflected in oci.  equity and other investments classified as long-term include both debt and equity instruments. debt and publicly-traded equity securities are classified as available-for-sale and realized gains and losses are recorded using the specific identification method. changes in market value, excluding other-than-temporary impairments, are reflected in oci. common and preferred stock and other investments that are restricted for more than one year or are not publicly traded are recorded at cost or using the equity method.  we lend certain fixed-income and equity securities to increase investment returns. the loaned securities continue to be carried as investments on our balance sheet. cash and/or security interests are received as collateral for the loaned securities with the amount determined based upon the underlying security lent and the creditworthiness of the borrower. cash received is recorded as an asset with a corresponding liability.  investments are considered to be impaired when a decline in fair value is judged to be other-than-temporary. fair value is calculated based on publicly available market information or other estimates determined by management. we employ a systematic methodology on a quarterly basis that considers available quantitative and qualitative evidence in evaluating potential impairment of our investments. if the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value, we evaluate, among other factors, general market conditions, credit quality of debt instrument issuers, the duration and extent to which the fair value is less than cost, and for equity securities, our intent and ability to hold, or plans to sell, the investment. for fixed-income securities, we also evaluate whether we have plans to sell the security or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery. we also consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of and business outlook for the investee, including industry and sector performance, changes in technology, and operational and financing cash flow factors. once a decline in fair value is determined to be other-than-temporary, an impairment charge is recorded to other income (expense) and a new cost basis in the investment is established.  derivative instruments are recognized as either assets or liabilities and are measured at fair value. the accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation.  for derivative instruments designated as fair-value hedges, the gain (loss) is recognized in earnings in the period of change together with the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged items attributed to the risk being hedged. for options designated as fair-value hedges, changes in the time value are excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and are recognized in earnings.  \u00a0 54  table of contents  \u00a0 part ii  item 8  \u00a0 for derivative instruments designated as cash-flow hedges, the effective portion of the derivative\u0092s gain (loss) is initially reported as a component of oci and is subsequently recognized in earnings when the hedged exposure is recognized in earnings. for options designated as cash-flow hedges, changes in the time value are excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and are recognized in earnings. gains (losses) on derivatives representing either hedge components excluded from the assessment of effectiveness or hedge ineffectiveness are recognized in earnings.  for derivative instruments that are not designated as hedges, gains (losses) from changes in fair values are primarily recognized in other income (expense). other than those derivatives entered into for investment purposes, such as commodity contracts, the gains (losses) are generally economically offset by unrealized gains (losses) in the underlying available-for-sale securities, which are recorded as a component of oci until the securities are sold or other-than-temporarily impaired, at which time the amounts are moved from oci into other income (expense).  allowance for doubtful accounts  the allowance for doubtful accounts reflects our best estimate of probable losses inherent in the accounts receivable balance. we determine the allowance based on known troubled accounts, historical experience, and other currently available evidence. activity in the allowance for doubtful accounts was as follows:  \u00a0 inventories  inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market, using the average cost method. cost includes materials, labor, and manufacturing overhead related to the purchase and production of inventories. we regularly review inventory quantities on hand, future purchase commitments with our suppliers, and the estimated utility of our inventory. if our review indicates a reduction in utility below carrying value, we reduce our inventory to a new cost basis through a charge to cost of revenue.  property and equipment  property and equipment is stated at cost and depreciated using the straight-line method over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the asset or the lease term. the estimated useful lives of our property and equipment are generally as follows: computer software developed or acquired for internal use, three years; computer equipment, two to three years; buildings and improvements, five to 15 years; leasehold improvements, two to 10 years; and furniture and equipment, one to five years. land is not depreciated.  goodwill  goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level (operating segment or one level below an operating segment) on an annual basis (may 1 for us) and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value.  \u00a0 55  table of contents  \u00a0 part ii  item 8  \u00a0 intangible assets  all of our intangible assets are subject to amortization and are amortized using the straight-line method over their estimated period of benefit, ranging from one to 15 years. we evaluate the recoverability of intangible assets periodically by taking into account events or circumstances that may warrant revised estimates of useful lives or that indicate the asset may be impaired.  recent accounting guidance  recently adopted accounting guidance  on july\u00a01, 2011, we adopted guidance issued by the financial accounting standards board (\u0093fasb\u0094) on disclosure requirements related to fair value measurements.\u00a0the guidance requires the disclosure of roll-forward activities on purchases, sales, issuances, and settlements of the assets and liabilities measured using significant unobservable inputs (level 3 fair value measurements).\u00a0adoption of this new guidance did not have a material impact on our financial statements.  on january\u00a01, 2012, we adopted guidance issued by the fasb on accounting and disclosure requirements related to fair value measurements.\u00a0the guidance limits the highest-and-best-use measure to nonfinancial assets, permits certain financial assets and liabilities with offsetting positions in market or counterparty credit risks to be measured at a net basis, and provides guidance on the applicability of premiums and discounts.\u00a0additionally, the guidance expands the disclosures on level 3 inputs by requiring quantitative disclosure of the unobservable inputs and assumptions, as well as description of the valuation processes and the sensitivity of the fair value to changes in unobservable inputs.\u00a0adoption of this new guidance did not have a material impact on our financial statements.  recent accounting guidance not yet adopted  in december 2011, the fasb issued guidance enhancing disclosure requirements about the nature of an entity\u0092s right to offset and related arrangements associated with its financial instruments and derivative instruments. the new guidance requires the disclosure of the gross amounts subject to rights of set-off, amounts offset in accordance with the accounting standards followed, and the related net exposure. the new guidance will be effective for us beginning july\u00a01, 2013. other than requiring additional disclosures, we do not anticipate material impacts on our financial statements upon adoption.  in september 2011, the fasb issued guidance on testing goodwill for impairment. the new guidance provides an entity the option to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. if an entity determines that this is the case, it is required to perform the currently prescribed two-step goodwill impairment test to identify potential goodwill impairment and measure the amount of goodwill impairment loss to be recognized for that reporting unit (if any). if an entity determines that the fair value of a reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount, the two-step goodwill impairment test is not required. the new guidance will be effective for us beginning july\u00a01, 2012.  in june 2011, the fasb issued guidance on presentation of comprehensive income.\u00a0the new guidance eliminates the current option to report other comprehensive income and its components in the statement of changes in stockholders\u0092 equity.\u00a0instead, an entity will be required to present either a continuous statement of net income and other comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements.\u00a0this portion of the guidance will be effective for us beginning july\u00a01, 2012 and will require financial statement presentation changes only. the new guidance also required entities to present reclassification adjustments out of accumulated other comprehensive income by component in both the statement in which net income is presented and the statement in which other comprehensive income is presented. however, in december 2011, the fasb issued guidance which indefinitely defers the guidance related to the presentation of reclassification adjustments.  \u00a0 56  table of contents  \u00a0 part ii  item 8  \u00a0 note 2 - earnings per share  basic earnings per share (\u0093eps\u0094) is computed based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. diluted eps is computed based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock plus the effect of dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period using the treasury stock method. dilutive potential common shares include outstanding stock options, stock awards, and shared performance stock awards. the components of basic and diluted eps are as follows:  \u00a0  we excluded the following shares underlying stock-based awards from the calculations of diluted eps because their inclusion would have been anti-dilutive:  \u00a0  in june 2010, we issued $1.25 billion of zero-coupon debt securities that are convertible into shares of our common stock if certain conditions are met.\u00a0as of june\u00a030, 2012, none of these securities had met price or other conditions that would make them eligible for conversion and therefore were excluded from the calculation of basic and diluted eps. see note\u00a012\u00a0\u0096 debt for additional information.  note 3 - other income (expense)  the components of other income (expense) were as follows:  \u00a0 \u00a0 57  table of contents  \u00a0 part ii  item 8  \u00a0 following are details of net recognized gains on investments during the periods reported:  \u00a0 note 4 - investments  investment components  the components of investments, including associated derivatives, were as follows:  \u00a0 \u00a0 58  table of contents  \u00a0 part ii  item 8  \u00a0 unrealized losses on investments  investments with continuous unrealized losses for less than 12 months and 12 months or greater and their related fair values were as follows:  \u00a0 unrealized losses from fixed-income securities are primarily attributable to changes in interest rates. unrealized losses from domestic and international equities are due to market price movements. management does not believe any remaining unrealized losses represent other-than-temporary impairments based on our evaluation of available evidence as of june\u00a030, 2012.  at june\u00a030, 2012 and 2011, the recorded bases of common and preferred stock and other investments that are restricted for more than one year or are not publicly traded were $313 million and $334 million, respectively. these investments are carried at cost and are reviewed quarterly for indicators of other-than-temporary impairment. it is not possible for us to reliably estimate the fair value of these investments.  debt investment maturities  \u00a0 \u00a0 59  table of contents  \u00a0 part ii  item 8  \u00a0 note 5 - derivatives  we use derivative instruments to manage risks related to foreign currencies, equity prices, interest rates, and credit; to enhance investment returns; and to facilitate portfolio diversification. our objectives for holding derivatives include reducing, eliminating, and efficiently managing the economic impact of these exposures as effectively as possible. our derivative programs include strategies that both qualify and do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment. all notional amounts presented below are measured in u.s. currency equivalents.  foreign currency  certain forecasted transactions, assets, and liabilities are exposed to foreign currency risk. we monitor our foreign currency exposures daily to maximize the economic effectiveness of our foreign currency hedge positions. option and forward contracts are used to hedge a portion of forecasted international revenue for up to three years in the future and are designated as cash flow hedging instruments. principal currencies hedged include the euro, japanese yen, british pound, and canadian dollar. as of june\u00a030, 2012 and june\u00a030, 2011, the total notional amounts of these foreign exchange contracts sold were $6.7 billion and $10.6 billion, respectively.  foreign currency risks related to certain non-u.s. dollar denominated securities are hedged using foreign exchange forward contracts that are designated as fair value hedging instruments. as of june\u00a030, 2012 and june\u00a030, 2011, the total notional amounts of these foreign exchange contracts sold were $1.3 billion and $572 million, respectively.  certain options and forwards not designated as hedging instruments are also used to manage the variability in exchange rates on accounts receivable, cash, and intercompany positions, and to manage other foreign currency exposures.\u00a0as of june\u00a030, 2012, the total notional amounts of these foreign exchange contracts purchased and sold were $3.6 billion and $7.3 billion, respectively. as of june\u00a030, 2011, the total notional amounts of these foreign exchange contracts purchased and sold were $4.3 billion and $7.1 billion, respectively.  equity  securities held in our equity and other investments portfolio are subject to market price risk.\u00a0market price risk is managed relative to broad-based global and domestic equity indices using certain convertible preferred investments, options, futures, and swap contracts not designated as hedging instruments. from time to time, to hedge our price risk, we may use and designate equity derivatives as hedging instruments, including puts, calls, swaps, and forwards.\u00a0as of june\u00a030, 2012, the total notional amounts of designated and non-designated equity contracts purchased and sold were $1.4 billion and $982 million, respectively. as of june\u00a030, 2011, the total notional amounts of designated and non-designated equity contracts purchased and sold were $1.1 billion and $860 million, respectively.  interest rate  securities held in our fixed-income portfolio are subject to different interest rate risks based on their maturities. we manage the average maturity of our fixed-income portfolio to achieve economic returns that correlate to certain broad-based fixed-income indices using exchange-traded option and futures contracts and over-the-counter swap and option contracts, none of which are designated as hedging instruments. as of june\u00a030, 2012, the total notional amounts of fixed-interest rate contracts purchased and sold were $3.2 billion and $1.9 billion, respectively. as of june\u00a030, 2011, the total notional amounts of fixed-interest rate contracts purchased and sold were $2.3 billion and $697 million, respectively.  in addition, we use \u0093to be announced\u0094 forward purchase commitments of mortgage-backed assets to gain exposure to agency mortgage-backed securities.\u00a0these meet the definition of a derivative instrument in cases where physical delivery of the assets is not taken at the earliest available delivery date. as of june\u00a030, 2012 and 2011, the total notional derivative amount of mortgage contracts purchased were $1.1 billion and $868 million, respectively.  \u00a0 60  table of contents  \u00a0 part ii  item 8  \u00a0 credit  our fixed-income portfolio is diversified and consists primarily of investment-grade securities. we use credit default swap contracts, not designated as hedging instruments, to manage credit exposures relative to broad-based indices and to facilitate portfolio diversification. we use credit default swaps as they are a low cost method of managing exposure to individual credit risks or groups of credit risks. as of june\u00a030, 2012, the total notional amounts of credit contracts purchased and sold were $318 million and $456 million, respectively. as of june\u00a030, 2011, the total notional amounts of credit contracts purchased and sold were $532 million and $281 million, respectively.  commodity  we use broad-based commodity exposures to enhance portfolio returns and to facilitate portfolio diversification. we use swap, futures, and option contracts, not designated as hedging instruments, to generate and manage exposures to broad-based commodity indices. we use derivatives on commodities as they can be low-cost alternatives to the purchase and storage of a variety of commodities, including, but not limited to, precious metals, energy, and grain. as of june\u00a030, 2012, the total notional amounts of commodity contracts purchased and sold were $1.5 billion and $445 million, respectively. as of june\u00a030, 2011, the total notional amounts of commodity contracts purchased and sold were $1.9 billion and $502 million, respectively.  credit-risk-related contingent features  certain of our counterparty agreements for derivative instruments contain provisions that require our issued and outstanding long-term unsecured debt to maintain an investment grade credit rating and require us to maintain a minimum liquidity of $1.0 billion. to the extent we fail to meet these requirements, we will be required to post collateral, similar to the standard convention related to over-the-counter derivatives. as of june\u00a030, 2012, our long-term unsecured debt rating was aaa, and cash investments were in excess of $1.0 billion. as a result, no collateral was required to be posted.  \u00a0 61  table of contents  \u00a0 part ii  item 8  \u00a0 fair values of derivative instruments  the following tables present the gross fair values of derivative instruments designated as hedging instruments (\u0093designated hedge derivatives\u0094) and not designated as hedging instruments (\u0093non-designated hedge derivatives\u0094). the fair values exclude the impact of netting derivative assets and liabilities when a legally enforceable master netting agreement exists and fair value adjustments related to our own credit risk and counterparty credit risk:  \u00a0 see also note 4 \u0096 investments and note\u00a06\u00a0\u0096 fair value measurements.  \u00a0 62  table of contents  \u00a0 part ii  item 8  \u00a0 fair value hedge gains (losses)  we recognized in other income (expense) the following gains (losses) on contracts designated as fair value hedges and their related hedged items:  \u00a0 cash flow hedge gains (losses)  we recognized the following gains (losses) on foreign exchange contracts designated as cash flow hedges (our only cash flow hedges during the periods presented):  \u00a0  we estimate that $137 million of net derivative gains included in oci at june\u00a030, 2012 will be reclassified into earnings within the following 12 months. no significant amounts of gains (losses) were reclassified from oci into earnings as a result of forecasted transactions that failed to occur during fiscal year 2012.  non-designated derivative gains (losses)  gains (losses) from changes in fair values of derivatives that are not designated as hedges are primarily recognized in other income (expense). these amounts are shown in the table below, with the exception of gains (losses) on derivatives presented in income statement line items other than other income (expense), which were immaterial for the periods presented. other than those derivatives entered into for investment purposes, such as commodity contracts, the gains (losses) below are generally economically offset by unrealized gains (losses) in the underlying available-for-sale securities.  \u00a0 \u00a0 63  table of contents  \u00a0 part ii  item 8  \u00a0 note 6 - fair

recurring basis:  \u00a0  \u00a0 \u00a0 64  table of contents  \u00a0 part ii  item 8  \u00a0 the following table reconciles the total net fair value of assets above to the balance sheet presentation of these same assets in note 4 \u0096 investments.  \u00a0 changes in financial instruments measured at level 3 fair value on a recurring basis  the following tables present the changes during the periods presented in our level 3 financial instruments that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis. the majority of these instruments consist of investment securities classified as available-for-sale with changes in fair value included in oci.  \u00a0  financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis  during fiscal year 2012 and 2011, we did not record any material other-than-temporary impairments on financial assets required to be measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis.  \u00a0 65  table of contents  \u00a0 part ii  item 8  \u00a0 note 7 - inventories  the components of inventories were as follows:  \u00a0 note 8 - property and equipment  the components of property and equipment were as follows:  \u00a0 during fiscal years 2012, 2011, and 2010, depreciation expense was $2.2 billion, $2.0 billion, and $1.8 billion, respectively.  note 9 - business combinations  skype  on october\u00a013, 2011, we acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of skype global s.\u00e1 r.l. (\u0093skype\u0094), a leading global provider of software applications and related internet communications products based in luxembourg, for $8.6 billion, primarily in cash. the major classes of assets and liabilities to which we allocated the purchase price were goodwill of $7.1 billion, identifiable intangible assets of $1.6 billion, and unearned revenue of $222 million. the goodwill recognized in connection with the acquisition is primarily attributable to our expectation of extending skype\u0092s brand and the reach of its networked platform, while enhancing microsoft\u0092s existing portfolio of real-time communications products and services. we assigned the goodwill to the following segments: $4.2 billion to entertainment and devices division, $2.8 billion to microsoft business division, and $54 million to online services division. skype was consolidated into our results of operations starting october\u00a013, 2011, the acquisition date.  following are the details of the purchase price allocated to the intangible assets acquired:  \u00a0 \u00a0 66  table of contents  \u00a0 part ii  item 8  \u00a0 other  during fiscal year 2012, we completed an additional four acquisitions for total consideration of $87 million, substantially all of which was paid in cash. during fiscal year 2011, we acquired three entities for total consideration of $75 million, substantially all of which was paid in cash. during fiscal year 2010, we acquired five entities for total consideration of $267 million, substantially all of which was paid in cash. during fiscal year 2010, we also sold three entities for total consideration of $600 million, including razorfish in the second quarter of fiscal year 2010. these entities have been included in or removed from our consolidated results of operations since their acquisition or sale dates, respectively.  pro forma results of operations have not been presented because the effects of the business combinations described in this note, individually and in aggregate, were not material to our consolidated results of operations.  note 10 - goodwill  changes in the carrying amount of goodwill by segment were as follows:  \u00a0 the measurement periods for purchase price allocations end as soon as information on the facts and circumstances becomes available, but do not exceed 12 months. adjustments in purchase price allocations may require a recasting of the amounts allocated to goodwill retroactive to the periods in which the acquisitions occurred.  any change in the goodwill amounts resulting from foreign currency translations are presented as \u0093other\u0094 in the above table. also included within \u0093other\u0094 are business dispositions and transfers between business segments due to reorganizations, as applicable. for fiscal year 2012, a $6.2 billion goodwill impairment charge is included in \u0093other,\u0094 as discussed further below. this goodwill impairment charge also represents our accumulated goodwill impairment as of june\u00a030, 2012.  goodwill impairment  we tested goodwill for impairment as of may\u00a01, 2012 at the reporting unit level using a discounted cash flow methodology with a peer-based, risk-adjusted weighted average cost of capital. we believe use of a discounted cash flow approach is the most reliable indicator of the fair values of the businesses.  upon completion of the annual test, osd goodwill was determined to be impaired. the impairment was the result of the osd unit experiencing slower than projected growth in search queries and search advertising revenue per query, slower growth in display revenue, and changes in the timing and implementation of certain initiatives designed to drive search and display revenue growth in the future. although revenues increased compared to the prior year, the industry is highly competitive and certain operational challenges have affected our expectations such that future growth and profitability are lower than previous estimates. in addition, in the current year, we added a business-specific risk factor to the weighted average cost of capital used to calculate the discounted cash flows of osd in estimating the fair value of the business. this business-specific risk factor reflects the increased uncertainty in forecasting the future performance of osd.  \u00a0 67  table of contents  \u00a0 part ii  item 8  \u00a0 because our annual test indicated that osd\u0092s carrying value exceeded its estimated fair value, a second phase of the goodwill impairment test (\u0093step 2\u0094) was performed specific to osd. under step 2, the fair value of all osd assets and liabilities were estimated, including tangible assets, existing technology, trade names, and partner relationships for the purpose of deriving an estimate of the implied fair value of goodwill. the implied fair value of the goodwill was then compared to the recorded goodwill to determine the amount of the impairment. assumptions used in measuring the value of these assets and liabilities included the discount rates, royalty rates, and obsolescence rates used in valuing the intangible assets, and pricing of comparable transactions in the market in valuing the tangible assets.  no other instances of impairment were identified in our may\u00a01, 2012 test.  note 11 - intangible assets  the components of intangible assets, all of which are finite-lived, were as follows:  \u00a0 \u00a0 we estimate that we have no significant residual value related to our intangible assets. no material impairments of intangible assets were identified during any of the periods presented.  the components of intangible assets acquired during the periods presented were as follows:  \u00a0 intangible assets amortization expense was $558 million, $537 million, and $707 million for fiscal years 2012, 2011, and 2010, respectively. amortization of capitalized software was $117 million, $114 million, and $97 million for fiscal years 2012, 2011, and 2010, respectively.  \u00a0 68  table of contents  \u00a0 part ii  item 8  \u00a0 the following table outlines the estimated future amortization expense related to intangible assets held at june\u00a030, 2012:  \u00a0 note 12 - debt  as of june\u00a030, 2012, the total carrying value and estimated fair value of our long-term debt, including the current portion, were $11.9 billion and $13.2 billion, respectively. this is compared to a carrying value and estimated fair value of $11.9 billion and $12.1 billion, respectively, as of june\u00a030, 2011. these estimated fair values are based on level 2 inputs.  the components of our long-term debt, including the current portion, and the associated interest rates and semi-annual interest record and payment dates were as follows as of june\u00a030, 2012 and 2011:  \u00a0 as of june\u00a030, 2012 and 2011, the aggregate unamortized discount for our long-term debt, including the current portion, was $56 million and $79 million, respectively.  notes  the notes are senior unsecured obligations and rank equally with our other unsecured and unsubordinated debt outstanding.  \u00a0 69  table of contents  \u00a0 part ii  item 8  \u00a0 convertible debt  in june 2010, we issued $1.25 billion of zero coupon convertible unsecured debt due on june\u00a015, 2013 in a private placement offering. proceeds from the offering were $1.24 billion, net of fees and expenses, which were capitalized. initially, each $1,000 principal amount of notes was convertible into 29.94 shares of microsoft common stock at a conversion price of $33.40 per share. the conversion ratio is adjusted periodically for dividends in excess of the initial dividend threshold as defined in the debt agreement. as of june\u00a030, 2012, the net carrying amount of our convertible debt was $1.2 billion and the unamortized discount was $19 million.  prior to march\u00a015, 2013, the notes will be convertible, only in certain circumstances, into cash and, if applicable, cash, shares of microsoft\u0092s common stock, or a combination thereof, at our election. on or after march\u00a015, 2013, the notes will be convertible at any time. upon conversion, we will pay cash up to the aggregate principal amount of the notes and pay or deliver cash, shares of our common stock, or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock, at our election.  because the convertible debt may be wholly or partially settled in cash, we are required to separately account for the liability and equity components of the notes in a manner that reflects our nonconvertible debt borrowing rate when interest costs are recognized in subsequent periods. the net proceeds of $1.24 billion were allocated between debt for $1.18 billion and stockholders\u0092 equity for $58 million with the portion in stockholders\u0092 equity representing the fair value of the option to convert the debt.  in connection with the issuance of the notes, we entered into capped call transactions with certain option counterparties who are initial purchasers of the notes or their affiliates. the capped call transactions are expected to reduce potential dilution of earnings per share upon conversion of the notes. under the capped call transactions, we purchased from the option counterparties capped call options that in the aggregate relate to the total number of shares of our common stock underlying the notes, with a strike price equal to the conversion price of the notes and with an initial cap price equal to $37.16, which is adjusted periodically to mirror any adjustments to the conversion price. the purchased capped calls were valued at $40 million and recorded to stockholders\u0092 equity.  debt service  maturities of our long-term debt for each of the next five years and thereafter are as follows:  \u00a0 cash paid for interest on our debt for fiscal years 2012, 2011, and 2010 was $344 million, $197 million, and $145 million, respectively.  \u00a0 70  table of contents  \u00a0 part ii  item 8  \u00a0 note 13 - income taxes  the components of the provision for income taxes were as follows:  \u00a0 u.s. and international components of income before income taxes were as follows:  \u00a0 the items accounting for the difference between income taxes computed at the u.s. federal statutory rate and our effective rate were as follows:  \u00a0 the reduction from the federal statutory rate from foreign earnings taxed at lower rates results from producing and distributing our products and services through our foreign regional operations centers in ireland, singapore, and puerto rico, which have lower income tax rates. in general, other reconciling items consist of interest, u.s. state income taxes, domestic production deductions, and credits. in fiscal years 2012, 2011, and 2010, there were no individually significant other reconciling items. the i.r.s. settlement is discussed below.  \u00a0 71  table of contents  \u00a0 part ii  item 8  \u00a0 the components of the deferred income tax assets and liabilities were as follows:  \u00a0 the valuation allowance disclosed in the table above relates to a portion of a $2.0 billion net operating loss carryforward generated primarily in foreign countries and acquired primarily through our acquisition of skype that may not be realized.  deferred income tax balances reflect the effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases and are stated at enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when the taxes are actually paid or recovered.  as of june\u00a030, 2012, we have not provided deferred u.s. income taxes or foreign withholding taxes on temporary differences of approximately $60.8 billion resulting from earnings for certain non-u.s. subsidiaries which are permanently reinvested outside the u.s. the unrecognized deferred tax liability associated with these temporary differences was approximately $19.4 billion at june\u00a030, 2012.  income taxes paid were $3.5 billion, $5.3 billion, and $4.1 billion in fiscal years 2012, 2011, and 2010, respectively.  uncertain tax positions  as of june\u00a030, 2012, we had $7.2 billion of unrecognized tax benefits of which $6.2 billion, if recognized, would affect our effective tax rate. as of june\u00a030, 2011, we had $6.9 billion of unrecognized tax benefits of which $5.9 billion, if recognized, would have affected our effective tax rate.  interest on unrecognized tax benefits was $154 million, $38 million, and $193 million in fiscal years 2012, 2011, and 2010, respectively. as of june\u00a030, 2012, 2011, and 2010, we had accrued interest related to uncertain tax positions of $939 million, $785 million, and $747 million, respectively, net of federal income tax benefits.  \u00a0 72  table of contents  \u00a0 part ii  item 8  \u00a0 the aggregate changes in the balance of unrecognized tax benefits were as follows:  \u00a0 during the third quarter of fiscal year 2011, we reached a settlement of a portion of an i.r.s. audit of tax years 2004 to 2006, which reduced our income tax expense by $461 million. while we settled a portion of the i.r.s. audit, we remain under audit for these years. in february 2012, the i.r.s. withdrew its 2011 revenue agents report and reopened the audit phase of the examination. as of june\u00a030, 2012, the primary unresolved issue relates to transfer pricing, which could have a significant impact on our financial statements if not resolved favorably. we believe our allowances for tax contingencies are appropriate. we do not believe it is reasonably possible that the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits will significantly increase or decrease within the next 12 months, as we do not believe the remaining open issues will be resolved within the next 12 months. we also continue to be subject to examination by the i.r.s. for tax years 2007 to 2011.  we are subject to income tax in many jurisdictions outside the u.s. certain jurisdictions remain subject to examination for tax years 1996 to 2011, some of which are currently under audit by local tax authorities. the resolutions of these audits are not expected to be material to our financial statements.  note 14 - unearned revenue  unearned revenue comprises mainly unearned revenue from volume licensing programs, and payments for offerings for which we have been paid in advance and we earn the revenue when we provide the service or software or otherwise meet the revenue recognition criteria.  volume licensing programs  unearned revenue from volume licensing programs represents customer billings for multi-year licensing arrangements paid either at inception of the agreement or annually at the beginning of each billing coverage period and accounted for as subscriptions with revenue recognized ratably over the billing coverage period.  other  also included in unearned revenue are payments for post-delivery support and consulting services to be performed in the future; xbox live subscriptions and prepaid points; sales of windows 7 with an option to upgrade to windows\u00a08 at a discounted price (the \u0093windows upgrade offer\u0094); microsoft dynamics business solutions products; skype prepaid credits and subscriptions; oem minimum commitments; and other offerings for which we have been paid in advance and earn the revenue when we provide the service or software, or otherwise meet the revenue recognition criteria.  \u00a0 73  table of contents  \u00a0 part ii  item 8  \u00a0 the components of unearned revenue were as follows:  \u00a0 \u00a0 unearned revenue by segment was as follows:  \u00a0 fiscal year 2011 amounts have been recast for the fiscal year 2012 movement of forefront protection for office, an anti-malware solution, from server and tools to the microsoft business division.  note 15 - other long-term liabilities  \u00a0 note 16 - commitments and guarantees  construction and operating leases  we have committed $353 million for constructing new buildings, building improvements, and leasehold improvements as of june\u00a030, 2012.  \u00a0 74  table of contents  \u00a0 part ii  item 8  \u00a0 we have operating leases for most u.s. and international sales and support offices and certain equipment. rental expense for facilities operating leases was $639 million, $525 million, and $530 million, in fiscal years 2012, 2011, and 2010, respectively. future minimum rental commitments under noncancellable facilities operating leases in place as of june\u00a030, 2012 are as follows:  \u00a0 indemnifications  we provide indemnifications of varying scope and size to certain customers against claims of intellectual property infringement made by third parties arising from the use of our products and certain other matters. we evaluate estimated losses for these indemnifications, and we consider such factors as the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss. to date, we have not encountered significant costs as a result of these obligations and have not accrued any liabilities related to these indemnifications in our financial statements.  yahoo! commercial agreement  on december\u00a04, 2009, we entered into a 10-year agreement with yahoo! inc. (\u0093yahoo!\u0094) whereby microsoft will provide the exclusive algorithmic and paid search platform for yahoo! websites. microsoft provided yahoo! with revenue per search guarantees for a period of 18 months after implementation of the microsoft search ads platform in each country, extended by an additional 12 months for the u.s. and canada. these guarantees are calculated, paid, and adjusted periodically and are rate guarantees, not guarantees of search volume. we estimate the remaining cost of the revenue per search guarantees during the guarantee period could range up to $120 million.  note 17 - contingencies  antitrust, unfair competition, and overcharge class actions  a large number of antitrust and unfair competition class action lawsuits were filed against us in various state, federal, and canadian courts on behalf of various classes of direct and indirect purchasers of our pc operating system and certain other software products between 1999 and 2005. we obtained dismissals or reached settlements of all claims made in the united states.  all settlements in the united states have received final court approval. under the settlements, generally class members can obtain vouchers that entitle them to be reimbursed for purchases of a wide variety of platform-neutral computer hardware and software. the total value of vouchers that we may issue varies by state. we will make available to certain schools a percentage of those vouchers that are not issued or claimed (one-half to two-thirds depending on the state). the total value of vouchers we ultimately issue will depend on the number of class members who make claims and are issued vouchers. the maximum value of vouchers to be issued is approximately $2.7 billion. the actual costs of these settlements will be less than that maximum amount, depending on the number of class members and schools that are issued and redeem vouchers. we estimate the total cost to resolve all of the state overcharge class action cases will range between $1.9 billion and $2.0 billion. at june\u00a030, 2012, we have recorded a liability related to these claims of approximately $500 million, which reflects our estimated exposure of $1.9 billion less payments made to date of approximately $1.4 billion mostly for vouchers, legal fees, and administrative expenses.  \u00a0 75  table of contents  \u00a0 part ii  item 8  \u00a0 the three cases pending in british columbia, ontario, and quebec, canada have not been settled. in march 2010, the court in the british columbia case certified it as a class action. in april\u00a02011, the british columbia court of appeal reversed the class certification ruling and dismissed the case, holding that indirect purchasers do not have a claim. the plaintiffs have appealed to the canadian supreme court, which will be heard in the fall of 2012. the other two actions have been stayed.  other antitrust litigation and claims  in november 2004, novell, inc. (\u0093novell\u0094) filed a complaint in u.s. district court for the district of utah (later transferred to federal court in maryland), asserting antitrust and unfair competition claims against us related to novell\u0092s ownership of wordperfect and other productivity applications during the period between june 1994 and march 1996. in june 2005, the trial court granted our motion to dismiss four of six claims of the complaint. in march\u00a02010, the trial court granted summary judgment in favor of microsoft as to all remaining claims. the court of appeals reversed that ruling as to one claim. trial of that claim took place from october to december 2011 and resulted in a mistrial because the jury was unable to reach a verdict. in july 2012, the trial court granted microsoft\u0092s motion for judgment as a matter of law. novell may appeal this decision.  government competition law matters  in december 2009, the european commission adopted a decision that rendered legally binding commitments offered by microsoft to address the commission\u0092s concerns about the inclusion of web browsing software in windows.\u00a0among other things, microsoft committed to display a \u0093browser choice screen\u0094 on windows-based pcs in europe where internet explorer is set as the default browser. due to a technical error, we failed to deliver the requisite software to enable that display to pcs that came preinstalled with a version of windows 7 called windows 7 service pack 1. we did deliver the requisite software to pcs running the original version of windows 7 and earlier editions of windows. following notification by the commission of reports that some pcs were not receiving the update, we promptly fixed the error and advised the commission of what we had discovered. pcs that come preinstalled with windows 7 service pack are now receiving the browser choice screen software, as intended.\u00a0on july\u00a017, 2012, the commission announced that it had opened proceedings to investigate whether microsoft had failed to comply with this commitment. the commission stated that if a company is found to have breached a legally binding commitment, the company may be fined up to 10% of its worldwide annual revenue.  patent and intellectual property claims  motorola litigation  in october 2010, microsoft filed patent infringement complaints against motorola mobility (\u0093motorola\u0094) with the international trade commission (\u0093itc\u0094) and in u.s. district court in seattle for infringement of nine microsoft patents by motorola\u0092s android devices. since then, microsoft and motorola have filed additional claims against each other in the itc, in federal district courts in seattle, wisconsin, florida, and california, and in courts in germany and the united kingdom. in april 2012, following complaints by microsoft and apple, the european union\u0092s competition office opened two antitrust investigations against motorola to determine whether it has abused certain of its standard essential patents to distort competition in breach of european union antitrust rules. in june 2012, we received a request for information from the u.s. federal trade commission (\u0093ftc\u0094) apparently related to an ftc investigation into whether motorola\u0092s conduct violates u.s. law. the nature of the claims asserted and status of individual matters are summarized below.  international trade commission  the hearing in microsoft\u0092s itc case against motorola took place in august 2011 on seven of the nine patents originally asserted in the complaint. in december 2011, the administrative law judge (\u0093alj\u0094) issued an initial determination that motorola infringed one microsoft patent, and recommended that the itc issue a limited exclusion  \u00a0 76  table of contents  \u00a0 part ii  item 8  \u00a0  order against motorola prohibiting importation of infringing motorola android devices. in may 2012, the itc issued the limited exclusion order recommended by the alj, which became effective on july\u00a018, 2012.\u00a0microsoft has appealed certain aspects of the itc ruling adverse to microsoft; motorola is expected to appeal the itc exclusion order.  in november 2010, motorola filed an action against microsoft in the itc alleging infringement of five motorola patents by xbox consoles and accessories and seeking an exclusion order to prohibit importation of the allegedly infringing xbox products into the u.s. in april 2012, the alj found that xbox products infringe four of the five patents asserted by motorola. the alj subsequently recommended that the itc issue a limited exclusion order and a cease and desist order. both microsoft and motorola sought itc review of the alj\u0092s findings. in june 2012, microsoft filed a motion to terminate the investigation as to certain patents based on facts arising as the result of google\u0092s acquisition of motorola. the itc determined that it would review the alj\u0092s initial determination in its entirety and remanded the matter to the alj (1)\u00a0to apply certain itc case precedent, (2)\u00a0to rule on microsoft\u0092s june 2012 motion to terminate, and (3)\u00a0set a new target date for completion of the investigation. if the itc issues an exclusion order or cease and desist order, it will be subject to presidential review for up to 60 days, during which it is expected that microsoft could import xbox products subject to posting a bond. should any order issue and survive presidential review, microsoft may be able to mitigate its impact by altering xbox products so they do not infringe the motorola patents.  u.s. district court  the seattle district court case filed in october 2010 by microsoft as a companion to microsoft\u0092s itc case against motorola has been stayed pending the outcome of microsoft\u0092s itc case.  in november 2010, microsoft sued motorola for breach of contract in u.s. district court in seattle, alleging that motorola breached its commitments to standards-setting organizations to license to microsoft certain patents on reasonable and non-discriminatory (\u0093rand\u0094) terms and conditions. motorola has declared these patents essential to the implementation of the h.264 video standard and the 802.11 wi-fi standard. in suits described below, motorola or a motorola affiliate subsequently sued microsoft on those patents in u.s. district courts, in the itc, and in germany. in february 2012, the seattle district court granted a partial summary judgment in favor of microsoft ruling that (1)\u00a0motorola entered into binding contractual commitments with standards organizations committing to license its declared-essential patents on rand terms and conditions; and (2)\u00a0microsoft is a third-party beneficiary of those commitments. subsequently, the court rejected motorola\u0092s argument that microsoft had repudiated its right to a rand license, and ruled a trial is needed to determine whether motorola is in breach of its obligation to enter into a patent license with microsoft and, if so, the amount of the rand royalty. in april 2012, the court issued a temporary restraining order preventing motorola from taking steps to enforce an injunction in germany relating to the h.264 video patents. in may 2012, the court converted that order into a preliminary injunction.\u00a0motorola has appealed the court\u0092s injunction orders to the court of appeals for the ninth circuit.\u00a0the seattle court has set a trial to determine the rand royalty to begin in november 2012.  cases filed by motorola in wisconsin, california, and florida, with the exception of one currently stayed case in wisconsin (a companion case to motorola\u0092s itc action), have been transferred at microsoft\u0092s request to the u.s district court in seattle. motorola and microsoft both seek damages as well as injunctive relief. no trial dates have been set in any of the transferred cases, and the parties have agreed to a stay of these cases.  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 77  table of contents  \u00a0 part ii  item 8  \u00a0 germany  in july 2011, motorola filed patent infringement actions in germany against microsoft and several microsoft subsidiaries.  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 in lawsuits microsoft filed in germany in september, october, and december 2011 and in april 2012, microsoft asserts motorola android devices infringe microsoft patents. microsoft seeks damages and an injunction. in may 2012, the court issued an injunction on one patent against motorola android devices in germany and ruled against microsoft on a second patent. if the court rules in favor of microsoft in a given case, an injunction could be issued immediately relating to the sale of the infringing devices in germany, which microsoft could then take steps to enforce. damages would be determined in later proceedings. motorola has appealed the first instance court\u0092s ruling in microsoft\u0092s favor.  united kingdom  in december 2011, microsoft filed an action against motorola in the high court of justice, chancery division, patents court, in london, england, seeking to revoke the uk part of the european patent asserted by motorola in germany against the activesync protocol. in february 2012, motorola counterclaimed alleging infringement of the patent and seeking damages and an injunction. a trial is expected in december 2012.  other patent and intellectual property claims  in addition to these cases, there are approximately 60 other patent infringement cases pending against microsoft.  other  we also are subject to a variety of other claims and suits that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of our business. although management currently believes that resolving claims against us, individually or in aggregate, will not have a material adverse impact on our financial statements, these matters are subject to inherent uncertainties and management\u0092s view of these matters may change in the future.  as of june\u00a030, 2012, we had accrued aggregate liabilities of $384 million in other current liabilities and $220 million in other long-term liabilities for all of our contingent legal matters. while we intend to defend these matters vigorously, adverse outcomes that we estimate could reach approximately $550 million in aggregate beyond recorded amounts are reasonably possible. were unfavorable final outcomes to occur, there exists the possibility of a material adverse impact on our financial statements for the period in which the effects become reasonably estimable.  \u00a0 78  table of contents  \u00a0 part ii  item 8  \u00a0 note 18 - stockholders\u0092 equity  shares outstanding  shares of common stock outstanding were as follows:  \u00a0 share repurchases  on september\u00a022, 2008, we announced that our board of directors approved a share repurchase program authorizing up to $40.0 billion in share repurchases with an expiration date of september\u00a030, 2013. as of june\u00a030, 2012, approximately $8.2 billion of the approved repurchase amount remained. the repurchase program may be suspended or discontinued at any time without prior notice.  we repurchased the following shares of common stock under the above-described repurchase plan using cash resources:  \u00a0 dividends  in fiscal year 2012, our board of directors declared the following dividends:  \u00a0  the dividend declared on june\u00a013, 2012 will be paid after the filing date of this report on form 10-k and was included in other current liabilities as of june\u00a030, 2012.  in fiscal year 2011, our board of directors declared the following dividends:  \u00a0  \u00a0 79  table of contents  \u00a0 part ii  item 8  \u00a0 the dividend declared on june\u00a015, 2011 was included in other current liabilities as of june\u00a030, 2011.  note 19 - other comprehensive income (loss)  the activity in other comprehensive income (loss) and related income tax effects were as follows:  \u00a0 the components of accumulated other comprehensive income were as follows:  \u00a0 note 20 - employee stock and savings plans  we grant stock-based compensation to directors and employees. at june\u00a030, 2012, an aggregate of 507\u00a0million shares were authorized for future grant under our stock plans, covering stock options, stock awards, and shared performance stock awards, and excluding shares reserved for issuance under our employee stock purchase plan. awards that expire or are canceled without delivery of shares generally become available for issuance under the plans. we issue new shares of microsoft common stock to satisfy exercises and vestings of awards granted under all of our stock plans.  stock-based compensation expense and related income tax benefits were as follows:  \u00a0  \u00a0 80  table of contents  \u00a0 part ii  item 8  \u00a0 stock plans (excluding stock options)  stock awards  stock awards (\u0093sas\u0094) are grants that entitle the holder to shares of microsoft common stock as the award vests. our sas generally vest over a five-year period.  shared performance stock awards  shared performance stock awards (\u0093spsas\u0094) are a form of sa in which the number of shares ultimately received depends on our business performance against specified performance targets.  we granted spsas for fiscal years 2012, 2011, and 2010 with performance periods of july\u00a01, 2011 through june\u00a030, 2012,\u00a0july\u00a01, 2010 through june\u00a030, 2011, and july\u00a01, 2009 through june\u00a030, 2010, respectively. in august following the end of each performance period, the number of shares of stock subject to the award is determined by multiplying the target award by a percentage ranging from 0% to 150%. the percentage is based on performance metrics for the performance period, as determined by the compensation committee of the board of directors in its sole discretion. an additional number of shares, approximately 12% of the total target spsas, are available as additional awards to participants based on individual performance. one-quarter of the shares of stock subject to each award vest following the end of the performance period, and an additional one-quarter of the shares vest on each of the following three anniversaries of the grant date.  executive officer incentive plan  under the executive officer incentive plan (\u0093eoip\u0094), the compensation committee awards performance-based compensation to executive officers for specified performance periods.\u00a0during the periods reported, executive officers were eligible to receive annual awards comprising cash and sas from an aggregate incentive pool equal to a percentage of consolidated operating income. for fiscal years 2012, 2011, and 2010, the pool was 0.3%, 0.25%, and 0.45% of operating income, respectively.  in september following the end of the fiscal year, each executive officer may receive a combined cash and sa award with a total value equal to a fixed percentage of the aggregate pool. the fixed percentage ranges between 0% and 150% of a target based on an assessment of the executive officer\u0092s performance during the prior fiscal year. following approval of the awards, 20% of the award is payable to the executive officers in cash, and the remaining 80% is converted into an sa for shares of microsoft common stock. the number of shares subject to the sa portion of the award is determined by dividing the value of 80% of the total award by the closing price of microsoft common stock on the last business day in august\u00a0of each year. the sa portion of the award vests one-quarter immediately after the award is approved following fiscal year-end\u00a0and one-quarter on august\u00a031 of each of the following three years.  activity for all stock plans  the fair value of each award was estimated on the date of grant using the following assumptions:  \u00a0  \u00a0 81  table of contents  \u00a0 part ii  item 8  \u00a0 during fiscal year 2012, the following activity occurred under our stock plans:  \u00a0 as of june\u00a030, 2012, there was $4.4 billion and $495 million of total unrecognized compensation costs related to sas and spsas, respectively. these costs are expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 2.9 years and 2.5 years, respectively.  during fiscal year 2011 and 2010, the following activity occurred under our stock plans:  \u00a0  following are the fair values of stock plan awards vested during the periods reported:  \u00a0  stock options  currently, we grant stock options primarily in conjunction with business acquisitions. we granted six million, zero, and one\u00a0million stock options in conjunction with business acquisitions during fiscal years 2012, 2011, and 2010, respectively.  \u00a0 82  table of contents  \u00a0 part ii  item 8  \u00a0 employee stock options activity during 2012 was as follows:  \u00a0  as of june\u00a030, 2012 approximately six\u00a0million options that were granted in conjunction with business acquisitions were outstanding. these options have an exercise price range of $0.01 to $29.24 and a weighted average exercise price of $9.33.  during the periods reported, the following stock

segment on behalf of other segments. each allocation is measured differently based on the specific facts and circumstances of the costs being allocated.  in addition, certain costs incurred at a

       the competitive pressures described above may cause decreased sales volumes, price reductions, and/or increased operating costs, such as for research and development, marketing, and sales incentives. this may lead to lower revenue, gross margins, and operating income.  our increasing focus on cloud-based services presents execution and competitive risks.\u00a0a growing part of our business involves cloud-based services available across the spectrum of computing devices. our strategic vision is to compete and grow by building best-in-class platforms and productivity services for an intelligent cloud and an intelligent edge infused with artificial intelligence (\u201cai\u201d). at the same time, our competitors are rapidly developing and deploying cloud-based services for consumers and business customers. pricing and delivery models are evolving. devices and form factors influence how users access services in the cloud and sometimes the user\u2019s choice of which cloud-based services to use. we are devoting significant resources to develop and deploy our cloud-based strategies. the windows ecosystem must continue to evolve with this changing environment. we are undertaking cultural and organizational changes to drive accountability and eliminate obstacles to innovation. our intelligent cloud and intelligent edge worldview is connected with the growth of the internet of things (\u201ciot\u201d). our success in the iot will depend on the level of adoption of our offerings such as microsoft azure, azure stack, azure iot edge, and azure sphere. we may not establish market share sufficient to achieve scale necessary to achieve our business objectives. besides software development costs, we are incurring costs to build and maintain infrastructure to support cloud computing services. these costs will reduce the operating margins we have previously achieved. whether we succeed in cloud-based services depends on our execution in several areas, including:            it is uncertain whether our strategies will attract the users or generate the revenue required to succeed. if we are not effective in executing organizational and technical changes to increase efficiency and accelerate innovation, or if we fail to generate sufficient usage of our new products and services, we may not grow revenue in line with the infrastructure and development investments described above. this may negatively impact gross margins and operating income.  18part i item 1a \u00a0 we make significant investments in products and services that may not achieve expected returns.\u00a0we will continue to make significant investments in research, development, and marketing for existing products, services, and technologies, including the windows operating system, microsoft 365, office, bing, microsoft sql server, windows server, azure, office 365, xbox live, mixer, linkedin, and other products and services. we also invest in the development and acquisition of a variety of hardware for productivity, communication, and entertainment including pcs, tablets, gaming devices, and hololens. investments in new technology are speculative. commercial success depends on many factors, including innovativeness, developer support, and effective distribution and marketing. if customers do not perceive our latest offerings as providing significant new functionality or other value, they may reduce their purchases of new software and hardware products or upgrades, unfavorably affecting revenue. we may not achieve significant revenue from new product, service, and distribution channel investments for several years, if at all. new products and services may not be profitable, and even if they are profitable, operating margins for some new products and businesses will not be as high as the margins we have experienced historically. we may not get engagement in certain features, like microsoft edge and bing, that drive post-sale monetization opportunities. our data handling practices across our products and services will continue to be under scrutiny and perceptions of mismanagement, driven by regulatory activity or negative public reaction to our practices or product experiences, which could negatively impact product and feature adoption, product design, and product quality. developing new technologies is complex. it can require long development and testing periods. significant delays in new releases or significant problems in creating new products or services could adversely affect our revenue.  acquisitions, joint ventures, and strategic alliances may have an adverse effect on our business.\u00a0we expect to continue making acquisitions and entering into joint ventures and strategic alliances as part of our long-term business strategy. in december 2016, we completed our acquisition of linkedin corporation (\u201clinkedin\u201d) for $27.0 billion, and in october 2018, we completed our acquisition of github, inc. for $7.5 billion. these acquisitions and other transactions and arrangements involve significant challenges and risks, including that they do not advance our business strategy, that we get an unsatisfactory return on our investment, that we have difficulty integrating and retaining new employees, business systems, and technology, or that they distract management from our other businesses. if an arrangement fails to adequately anticipate changing circumstances and interests of a party, it may result in early termination or renegotiation of the arrangement. the success of these transactions and arrangements will depend in part on our ability to leverage them to enhance our existing products and services or develop compelling new ones. it may take longer than expected to realize the full benefits from these transactions and arrangements such as increased revenue or enhanced efficiencies, or the benefits may ultimately be smaller than we expected. these events could adversely affect our consolidated financial statements.  if our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets become impaired, we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings.\u00a0we acquire other companies and intangible assets and may not realize all the economic benefit from those acquisitions, which could cause an impairment of goodwill or intangibles. we review our amortizable intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. we test goodwill for impairment at least annually. factors that may be a change in circumstances, indicating that the carrying value of our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets may not be recoverable, include a decline in our stock price and market capitalization, reduced future cash flow estimates, and slower growth rates in industry segments in which we participate. we have in the past recorded, and may in the future be required to record a significant charge on our consolidated financial statements during the period in which any impairment of our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets is determined, negatively affecting our results of operations. our acquisition of linkedin resulted in a significant increase in our goodwill and intangible asset balances.  19part i item 1a \u00a0 cyberattacks and security vulnerabilities could lead to reduced revenue, increased costs, liability claims, or harm to our reputation or competitive position.  security of our information technology  threats to it security can take a variety of forms. individual and groups of hackers and sophisticated organizations, including state-sponsored organizations or nation-states, continuously undertake attacks that pose threats to our customers and our it.\u00a0these actors may use a wide variety of methods, which may include developing and deploying malicious software or exploiting vulnerabilities in hardware, software, or other infrastructure in order to attack our products and services or gain access to our networks and datacenters, using social engineering techniques to induce our employees, users, partners, or customers to disclose passwords or other sensitive information or take other actions to gain access to our data or our users\u2019 or customers\u2019 data, or acting in a coordinated manner to launch distributed denial of service or other coordinated attacks. inadequate account security practices may also result in unauthorized access to confidential data. for example, system administrators may fail to timely remove employee account access when no longer appropriate. employees or third parties may intentionally compromise our or our users\u2019 security or systems, or reveal confidential information. cyberthreats are constantly evolving, increasing the difficulty of detecting and successfully defending against them. we may have no current capability to detect certain vulnerabilities, which may allow them to persist in the environment over long periods of time. cyberthreats can have cascading impacts that unfold with increasing speed across our internal networks and systems and those of our partners and customers. breaches of our facilities, network, or data security could disrupt the security of our systems and business applications, impair our ability to provide services to our customers and protect the privacy of their data, result in product development delays, compromise confidential or technical business information harming our reputation or competitive position, result in theft or misuse of our intellectual property or other assets, require us to allocate more resources to improved technologies, or otherwise adversely affect our business. in addition, our internal it environment continues to evolve. often, we are early adopters of new devices and technologies. we embrace new ways of sharing data and communicating internally and with partners and customers using methods such as social networking and other consumer-oriented technologies. our business policies and internal security controls may not keep pace with these changes as new threats emerge. security of our products, services, devices, and customers\u2019 data the security of our products and services is important in our customers\u2019 decisions to purchase or use our products or services. security threats are a significant challenge to companies like us whose business is providing technology products and services to others. threats to our own it infrastructure can also affect our customers. customers using our cloud-based services rely on the security of our infrastructure, including hardware and other elements provided by third parties, to ensure the reliability of our services and the protection of their data. adversaries tend to focus their efforts on the most popular operating systems, programs, and services, including many of ours, and we expect that to continue. adversaries that acquire user account information at other companies can use that information to compromise our users\u2019 accounts where accounts share the same attributes like passwords. inadequate account security practices may also result in unauthorized access. we are also increasingly incorporating open source software into our products. there may be vulnerabilities in open source software that may make our products susceptible to cyberattacks. to defend against security threats to our internal it systems, our cloud-based services, and our customers\u2019 systems, we must continuously engineer more secure products and services, enhance security and reliability features, improve the deployment of software updates to address security vulnerabilities in our own products as well as those provided by others, develop mitigation technologies that help to secure customers from attacks even when software updates are not deployed, maintain the digital security infrastructure that protects the integrity of our network, products, and services, and provide security tools such as firewalls and anti-virus software and information about the need to deploy security measures and the impact of doing so.  20part i item 1a \u00a0 the cost of these steps could reduce our operating margins. if we fail to do these things well, actual or perceived security vulnerabilities in our products and services, data corruption issues, or reduced performance could harm our reputation and lead customers to reduce or delay future purchases of products or subscriptions to services, or to use competing products or services. customers may also spend more on protecting their existing computer systems from attack, which could delay adoption of additional products or services. customers may fail to update their systems, continue to run software or operating systems we no longer support, or may fail timely to install or enable security patches. any of these could adversely affect our reputation and revenue. actual or perceived vulnerabilities may lead to claims against us. our license agreements typically contain provisions that eliminate or limit our exposure to liability, but there is no assurance these provisions will withstand legal challenges. at times, to achieve commercial objectives, we may enter into agreements with larger liability exposure to customers.  as illustrated by the spectre and meltdown threats, our products operate in conjunction with and are dependent on products and components across a broad ecosystem of third parties. if there is a security vulnerability in one of these components, and if there is a security exploit targeting it, we could face increased costs, liability claims, reduced revenue, or harm to our reputation or competitive position. disclosure and misuse of personal data could result in liability and harm our reputation.\u00a0as we continue to grow the number and scale of our cloud-based offerings, we store and process increasingly large amounts of personally identifiable information of our customers and users. the continued occurrence of high-profile data breaches provides evidence of an external environment increasingly hostile to information security. despite our efforts to improve the security controls across our business groups and geographies, it is possible our security controls over personal data, our training of employees and third parties on data security, and other practices we follow may not prevent the improper disclosure or misuse of customer or user data we or our vendors store and manage. in addition, third parties who have limited access to our customer or user data may use this data in unauthorized ways. improper disclosure or misuse could harm our reputation, lead to legal exposure to customers or users, or subject us to liability under laws that protect personal data, resulting in increased costs or loss of revenue. our software products and services also enable our customers and users to store and process personal data on-premises or, increasingly, in a cloud-based environment we host. government authorities can sometimes require us to produce customer or user data in response to valid legal orders. in the u.s. and elsewhere, we advocate for transparency concerning these requests and appropriate limitations on government authority to compel disclosure. despite our efforts to protect customer and user data, perceptions that the collection, use, and retention of personal information is not satisfactorily protected could inhibit sales of our products or services, and could limit adoption of our cloud-based solutions by consumers, businesses, and government entities. additional security measures we may take to address customer or user concerns, or constraints on our flexibility to determine where and how to operate datacenters in response to customer or user expectations or governmental rules or actions, may cause higher operating expenses or hinder growth of our products and services.  we may not be able to protect information in our products and services from use by others. linkedin and other microsoft products and services contain valuable information and content protected by contractual restrictions or technical measures. in certain cases, we have made commitments to our members and users to limit access to or use of this information. changes in the law or interpretations of the law may weaken our ability to prevent third parties from scraping or gathering information or content through use of bots or other measures and using it for their own benefit, thus diminishing the value of our products and services. abuse of our platforms may harm our reputation or user engagement.  advertising, professional, and social platform abuses  for linkedin, microsoft advertising, msn, xbox live, and other products and services that provide content or host ads that come from or can be influenced by third parties, our reputation or user engagement may be negatively affected by activity that is hostile or inappropriate. this activity may come from users impersonating other people or organizations, use of our products or services to spread terrorist or violent extremist content or to disseminate information that may be viewed as misleading or intended to manipulate the opinions of our users, or the use of our products or services that violates our terms of service or otherwise for objectionable or illegal ends. preventing or responding to these actions may require us to make substantial investments in people and technology and these investments may not be successful, adversely affecting our business and consolidated financial statements. 21part i item 1a \u00a0 harmful content online\u00a0\u00a0  our hosted consumer services as well as our enterprise services may be used by third parties to disseminate harmful or illegal content in violation of our terms or applicable law. we may not proactively discover such content due to scale and the limitations of existing technologies, and when discovered by users, such content may negatively affect our reputation, our brands, and user engagement. regulations and other initiatives to make platforms responsible for preventing or eliminating harmful content online are gaining momentum and we expect this to continue. we may be subject to enhanced regulatory oversight, substantial liability, or reputational damage if we fail to comply with content moderation regulations, adversely affecting our business and consolidated financial statements. the development of the iot presents security, privacy, and execution risks. to support the growth of the intelligent cloud and the intelligent edge, we are developing products, services, and technologies to power the iot, a network of distributed and interconnected devices employing sensors, data, and computing capabilities including ai. the iot\u2019s great potential also carries substantial risks. iot products and services may contain defects in design, manufacture, or operation, that make them insecure or ineffective for their intended purposes. an iot solution has multiple layers of hardware, sensors, processors, software, and firmware, several of which we may not develop or control. each layer, including the weakest layer, can impact the security of the whole system. many iot devices have limited interfaces and ability to be updated or patched. iot solutions may collect large amounts of data, and our handling of iot data may not satisfy customers or regulatory requirements. iot scenarios may increasingly affect personal health and safety. if iot solutions that include our technologies do not work as intended, violate the law, or harm individuals or businesses, we may be subject to legal claims or enforcement actions. these risks, if realized, may increase our costs, damage our reputation or brands, or negatively impact our revenues or margins.\u00a0\u00a0 issues in the use of ai in our offerings may result in reputational harm or liability. we are building ai into many of our offerings and we expect this element of our business to grow. we envision a future in which ai operating in our devices, applications, and the cloud helps our customers be more productive in their work and personal lives. as with many disruptive innovations, ai presents risks and challenges that could affect its adoption, and therefore our business. ai algorithms may be flawed. datasets may be insufficient or contain biased information. inappropriate or controversial data practices by microsoft or others could impair the acceptance of ai solutions. these deficiencies could undermine the decisions, predictions, or analysis ai applications produce, subjecting us to competitive harm, legal liability, and brand or reputational harm. some ai scenarios present ethical issues. if we enable or offer ai solutions that are controversial because of their impact on human rights, privacy, employment, or other social issues, we may experience brand or reputational harm.\u00a0\u00a0 we may have excessive outages, data losses, and disruptions of our online services if we fail to maintain an adequate operations infrastructure.\u00a0our increasing user traffic, growth in services, and the complexity of our products and services demand more computing power. we spend substantial amounts to build, purchase, or lease datacenters and equipment and to upgrade our technology and network infrastructure to handle more traffic on our websites and in our datacenters. these demands continue to increase as we introduce new products and services and support the growth of existing services such as bing, azure, microsoft account services, office 365, microsoft teams, dynamics 365, onedrive, sharepoint online, skype, xbox live, and outlook.com. we are rapidly growing our business of providing a platform and back-end hosting for services provided by third parties to their end users. maintaining, securing, and expanding this infrastructure is expensive and complex. it requires that we maintain an internet connectivity infrastructure that is robust and reliable within competitive and regulatory constraints that continue to evolve. inefficiencies or operational failures, including temporary or permanent loss of customer data or insufficient internet connectivity, could diminish the quality of our products, services, and user experience resulting in contractual liability, claims by customers and other third parties, regulatory actions, damage to our reputation, and loss of current and potential users, subscribers, and advertisers, each of which may adversely impact our consolidated financial statements.  we may experience quality or supply problems.\u00a0our hardware products such as xbox consoles, surface devices, and other devices we design, manufacture, and market are highly complex and can have defects in design, manufacture, or associated software. we could incur significant expenses, lost revenue, and reputational harm as a result of recalls, safety alerts, or product liability claims if we fail to prevent, detect, or address such issues through design, testing, or warranty repairs.  22part i item 1a \u00a0 our software products and services also may experience quality or reliability problems. the highly sophisticated software we develop may contain bugs and other defects that interfere with their intended operation. our customers increasingly rely on us for critical functions, potentially magnifying the impact of quality or reliability issues. any defects we do not detect and fix in pre-release testing could cause reduced sales and revenue, damage to our reputation, repair or remediation costs, delays in the release of new products or versions, or legal liability. although our license agreements typically contain provisions that eliminate or limit our exposure to liability, there is no assurance these provisions will withstand legal challenge. we acquire some device and datacenter components from sole suppliers. our competitors use some of the same suppliers and their demand for hardware components can affect the capacity available to us. if a component from a sole-source supplier is delayed or becomes unavailable, whether because of supplier capacity constraint, industry shortages, legal or regulatory changes, or other reasons, we may not obtain timely replacement supplies, resulting in reduced sales or inadequate datacenter capacity. component shortages, excess or obsolete inventory, or price reductions resulting in inventory adjustments may increase our cost of revenue. xbox consoles, surface devices, datacenter servers, and other hardware are assembled in asia and other geographies that may be subject to disruptions in the supply chain, resulting in shortages that would affect our revenue and operating margins. these same risks would apply to any other hardware and software products we may offer.  we may not be able to protect our source code from copying if there is an unauthorized disclosure.\u00a0source code, the detailed program commands for our operating systems and other software programs, is critical to our business. although we license portions of our application and operating system source code to several licensees, we take significant measures to protect the secrecy of large portions of our source code. if our source code leaks, we might lose future trade secret protection for that code. it may then become easier for third parties to compete with our products by copying functionality, which could adversely affect our revenue and operating margins. unauthorized disclosure of source code also could increase the security risks described in the next paragraph. legal changes, our evolving business model, piracy, and other factors may decrease the value of our intellectual property. protecting our intellectual property rights and combating unlicensed copying and use of our software and other intellectual property on a global basis is difficult. while piracy adversely affects u.s. revenue, the impact on revenue from outside the u.s. is more significant, particularly countries in which the legal system provides less protection for intellectual property rights. our revenue in these markets may grow more slowly than the underlying device market. similarly, the absence of harmonized patent laws makes it more difficult to ensure consistent respect for patent rights. throughout the world, we educate users about the benefits of licensing genuine products and obtaining indemnification benefits for intellectual property risks, and we educate lawmakers about the advantages of a business climate where intellectual property rights are protected. reductions in the legal protection for software intellectual property rights could adversely affect revenue.  we expend significant resources to patent the intellectual property we create with the expectation that we will generate revenues by incorporating that intellectual property in our products or services or, in some instances, by licensing our patents to others in return for a royalty.\u00a0changes in the law may continue to weaken our ability to prevent the use of patented technology or collect revenue for licensing our patents.\u00a0these include legislative changes and regulatory actions that make it more difficult to obtain injunctions, and the increasing use of legal process to challenge issued patents. similarly, licensees of our patents may fail to satisfy their obligations to pay us royalties, or may contest the scope and extent of their obligations. the royalties we can obtain to monetize our intellectual property may decline because of the evolution of technology, selling price changes in products using licensed patents, or the difficulty of discovering infringements. finally, our increasing engagement with open source software will also cause us to license our intellectual property rights broadly in certain situations and may negatively impact revenue. 23part i item 1a \u00a0 third parties may claim we infringe their intellectual property rights.\u00a0from time to time, others claim we infringe their intellectual property rights. the number of these claims may grow because of constant technological change in the markets in which we compete, the extensive patent coverage of existing technologies, the rapid rate of issuance of new patents, and our offering of first-party devices, such as microsoft surface. to resolve these claims, we may enter into royalty and licensing agreements on terms that are less favorable than currently available, stop selling or redesign affected products or services, or pay damages to satisfy indemnification commitments with our customers. these outcomes may cause operating margins to decline. besides money damages, in some jurisdictions plaintiffs can seek injunctive relief that may limit or prevent importing, marketing, and selling our products or services that have infringing technologies. in some countries, such as germany, an injunction can be issued before the parties have fully litigated the validity of the underlying patents. we have paid significant amounts to settle claims related to the use of technology and intellectual property rights and to procure intellectual property rights as part of our strategy to manage this risk, and may continue to do so.  we have claims and lawsuits against us that may result in adverse outcomes.\u00a0we are subject to a variety of claims and lawsuits. these claims may arise from a wide variety of business practices and initiatives, including major new product releases such as windows 10, significant business transactions, warranty or product claims, and employment practices. adverse outcomes in some or all of these claims may result in significant monetary damages or injunctive relief that could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business. the litigation and other claims are subject to inherent uncertainties and management\u2019s view of these matters may change in the future. a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements could occur for the period in which the effect of an unfavorable outcome becomes probable and reasonably estimable.  government litigation and regulatory activity relating to competition rules may limit how we design and market our products.\u00a0as a leading global software and device maker, government agencies closely scrutinize us under u.s. and foreign competition laws. governments are actively enforcing competition laws and regulations, and this includes scrutiny in potentially large markets such as the european union (\u201ceu\u201d), the u.s., and china. some jurisdictions also allow competitors or consumers to assert claims of anti-competitive conduct. u.s. federal and state antitrust authorities have previously brought enforcement actions and continue to scrutinize our business.  the european commission (\u201cthe commission\u201d) closely scrutinizes the design of high-volume microsoft products and the terms on which we make certain technologies used in these products, such as file formats, programming interfaces, and protocols, available to other companies. flagship product releases such as windows 10 can receive significant scrutiny under competition laws. for example, in 2004, the commission ordered us to create new versions of our windows operating system that do not include certain multimedia technologies and to provide our competitors with specifications for how to implement certain proprietary windows communications protocols in their own products. in 2009, the commission accepted a set of commitments we offered to address the commission\u2019s concerns relating to competition in web browsing software, including an undertaking to address commission concerns relating to interoperability. the web browsing commitments expired in 2014. the remaining obligations may limit our ability to innovate in windows or other products in the future, diminish the developer appeal of the windows platform, and increase our product development costs. the availability of licenses related to protocols and file formats may enable competitors to develop software products that better mimic the functionality of our products, which could hamper sales of our\u00a0products.  our portfolio of first-party devices continues to grow; at the same time our oem partners offer a large variety of devices for our platforms. as a result, increasingly we both cooperate and compete with our oem partners, creating a risk that we fail to do so in compliance with competition rules. regulatory scrutiny in this area may increase. certain foreign governments, particularly in china and other countries in asia, have advanced arguments under their competition laws that exert downward pressure on royalties for our intellectual property.  government regulatory actions and court decisions such as these may result in fines, or hinder our ability to provide the benefits of our software to consumers and businesses, reducing the attractiveness of our products and the revenue that come from them. new competition law actions could be initiated, potentially using previous actions as precedent. the outcome of such actions, or steps taken to avoid them, could adversely affect us in a variety of ways, including:    24part i item 1a \u00a0       our global operations subject us to potential liability under anti-corruption, trade protection, and other laws and regulations.\u00a0the foreign corrupt practices act (\u201cfcpa\u201d) and other anti-corruption laws and regulations (\u201canti-corruption laws\u201d) prohibit corrupt payments by our employees, vendors, or agents, and the accounting provisions of the fcpa require us to maintain accurate books and records and adequate internal controls. from time to time, we receive inquiries from authorities in the u.s. and elsewhere which may be based on reports from employees and others about our business activities outside the u.s. and our compliance with anti-corruption laws. periodically, we receive such reports directly and investigate them. on july 22, 2019, our hungarian subsidiary entered into a non-prosecution agreement (\u201cnpa\u201d) with the u.s. department of justice (\u201cdoj\u201d) and we agreed to the terms of a cease and desist order with the securities and exchange commission.\u202fthese agreements required us to pay $25.3 million in monetary penalties, disgorgement, and interest pertaining to activities at microsoft\u2019s subsidiary in hungary.\u00a0the npa, which has a three-year term, also contains certain ongoing compliance requirements, including the obligations to disclose to the doj issues that may implicate the fcpa and to cooperate in any inquiries. most countries in which we operate also have competition laws that prohibit competitors from colluding or otherwise attempting to reduce competition between themselves. while we devote substantial resources to our u.s. and international compliance programs and have implemented policies, training, and internal controls designed to reduce the risk of corrupt payments and collusive activity, our employees, vendors, or agents may violate our policies. our failure to comply with anti-corruption laws or competition laws could result in significant fines and penalties, criminal sanctions against us, our officers, or our employees, prohibitions on the conduct of our business, and damage to our reputation. operations outside the u.s. may be affected by changes in trade protection laws, policies, sanctions, and other regulatory requirements affecting trade and investment. we may be subject to legal liability and reputational damage if we sell goods or services in violation of u.s. trade sanctions on restricted entities or countries such as iran, north korea, cuba, sudan, and syria.  other regulatory areas that may apply to our products and online services offerings include user privacy, telecommunications, data storage and protection, and online content. for example, some regulators are taking the position that our offerings such as skype are covered by existing laws regulating telecommunications services, and some new laws are defining more of our services as regulated telecommunications services. this trend may continue and will result in these offerings being subjected to additional data protection, security, and law enforcement surveillance obligations. data protection authorities may assert that our collection, use, and management of customer data is inconsistent with their laws and regulations. legislative or regulatory action relating to cybersecurity requirements may increase the costs to develop, implement, or secure our products and services. legislative or regulatory action could also emerge in the area of ai and content moderation, increasing costs or restricting opportunity. applying these laws and regulations to our business is often unclear, subject to change over time, and sometimes may conflict from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. additionally, these laws and governments\u2019 approach to their enforcement, and our products and services, are continuing to evolve. compliance with these types of regulation may involve significant costs or require changes in products or business practices that result in reduced revenue. noncompliance could result in the imposition of penalties or orders we stop the alleged noncompliant activity.  we strive to empower all people and organizations to achieve more, and accessibility of our products is an important aspect of this goal. there is increasing pressure from advocacy groups, regulators, competitors, customers, and other stakeholders to make technology more accessible. if our products do not meet customer expectations or emerging global accessibility requirements, we could lose sales opportunities or face regulatory actions 25part i item 1a \u00a0 laws and regulations relating to the handling of personal data may impede the adoption of our services or result in increased costs, legal claims, fines against us, or reputational damage.\u00a0the growth of our internet- and cloud-based services internationally relies increasingly on the movement of data across national boundaries. legal requirements relating to the collection, storage, handling, and transfer of personal data continue to evolve. for example, the eu and the u.s. formally entered into a new framework in july 2016 that provides a mechanism for companies to transfer data from eu member states to the u.s. this framework, called the privacy shield, is intended to address shortcomings identified by the european court of justice in a predecessor mechanism. the privacy shield and other mechanisms are currently subject to challenges in european courts, which may lead to uncertainty about the legal basis for data transfers across the atlantic. the privacy shield and other potential rules on the flow of data across borders could increase the cost and complexity of delivering our products and services in some markets. in may 2018, a new eu law governing data practices and privacy, the general data protection regulation (\u201cgdpr\u201d), became effective.\u00a0the law, which applies to all of our activities conducted from an establishment in the eu or related to products and services offered in the eu, imposes a range of new compliance obligations regarding the handling of personal data. engineering efforts to build new capabilities to facilitate compliance with the law have entailed substantial expense and the diversion of engineering resources from other projects and may continue to do so. we might experience reduced demand for our offerings if we are unable to engineer products that meet our legal duties or help our customers meet their obligations under the gdpr or other data regulations, or if the changes we implement to comply with the gdpr make our offerings less attractive. the gdpr imposes significant new obligations and compliance with these obligations depends in part on how particular regulators interpret and apply them. if we fail to comply with the gdpr, or if regulators assert we have failed to comply with the gdpr, it may lead to regulatory enforcement actions, which can result in monetary penalties of up to 4% of worldwide revenue, private lawsuits, or reputational damage. in the u.s., california has adopted and several states are considering adopting laws and regulations imposing obligations regarding the handling of personal data. the company\u2019s investment in gaining insights from data is becoming central to the value of the services we deliver to customers, to our operational efficiency and key opportunities in monetization, customer perceptions of quality, and operational efficiency. our ability to use data in this way may be constrained by regulatory developments that impede realizing the expected return from this investment. ongoing legal reviews by regulators may result in burdensome or inconsistent requirements, including data sovereignty and localization requirements, affecting the location and movement of our customer and internal employee data as well as the management of that data. compliance with applicable laws and regulations regarding personal data may require changes in services, business practices, or internal systems that result in increased costs, lower revenue, reduced efficiency, or greater difficulty in competing with foreign-based firms. compliance with data regulations might limit our ability to innovate or offer certain features and functionality in some jurisdictions where we operate. failure to comply with existing or new rules may result in significant penalties or orders to stop the alleged noncompliant activity, as well as negative publicity and diversion of management time and effort.  we may have additional tax liabilities.\u00a0we are subject to income taxes in the u.s. and many foreign jurisdictions. significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes. in the course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. for example, compliance with the 2017 united states tax cuts and jobs act (\u201ctcja\u201d) may require the collection of information not regularly produced within the company, the use of estimates in our consolidated financial statements, and the exercise of significant judgment in accounting for its provisions. as regulations and guidance evolve with respect to the tcja, and as we gather more information and perform more analysis, our results may differ from previous estimates and may materially affect our consolidated financial statements. we regularly are under audit by tax authorities in different jurisdictions. although we believe that our provision for income taxes and our tax estimates are reasonable, tax authorities may disagree with certain positions we have taken.\u00a0\u00a0in addition, economic\u00a0and political\u00a0pressures to increase tax revenue in various jurisdictions may make resolving tax disputes favorably more difficult. we are currently under internal revenue service audit for prior tax years, with the primary unresolved issues relating to transfer pricing. the final resolution of those audits, and other audits or litigation, may differ from the amounts recorded in our consolidated financial statements and may materially affect our consolidated financial statements in the period or periods in which that determination is made.  26part i item 1a \u00a0 we earn a significant amount of our operating income outside the u.s. a change in the mix of earnings and losses in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in our business or structure, or the expiration of or disputes about certain tax agreements in a particular country may result in higher effective tax rates for the company. in addition, changes in u.s. federal and state or international tax laws applicable to corporate multinationals, other fundamental law changes currently being considered by many countries, including in the u.s., and changes in taxing jurisdictions\u2019 administrative interpretations, decisions, policies, and positions may materially adversely impact our consolidated financial statements.  if our reputation or our brands are damaged, our business and operating results may be harmed. our reputation and brands are globally recognized and are important to our business. our reputation and brands affect our ability to attract and retain consumer, business, and public-sector customers. there are numerous ways our reputation or brands could be damaged. these include product safety or quality issues, or our environmental impact and sustainability, supply chain practices, or human rights record. we may experience backlash from customers, government entities, advocacy groups, employees, and other stakeholders that disagree with our product offering decisions or public policy positions. damage to our reputation or our brands may occur from, among other things:        the proliferation of social media may increase the likelihood, speed, and magnitude of negative brand events. if our brands or reputation are damaged, it could negatively impact our revenues or margins, or ability to attract the most highly qualified employees. our global business exposes us to operational and economic risks.\u00a0our customers are located throughout the world and a significant part of our revenue comes from international sales. the global nature of our business creates operational and economic risks. our results of operations may be affected by global, regional, and local economic developments, monetary policy, inflation, and recession, as well as political and military disputes. in addition, our international growth strategy includes certain markets, the developing nature of which presents several risks, including deterioration of social, political, labor, or economic conditions in a country or region, and difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations. emerging nationalist trends in specific countries may significantly alter the trade environment. changes to trade policy or agreements as a result of populism, protectionism, or economic nationalism may result in higher tariffs, local sourcing initiatives, or other developments that make it more difficult to sell our products in foreign countries. disruptions of these kinds in developed or emerging markets could negatively impact demand for our products and services or increase operating costs. although we hedge a portion of our international currency exposure, significant fluctuations in foreign exchange rates between the u.s. dollar and foreign currencies may adversely affect our results of operations.  adverse economic or market conditions may harm our business.\u00a0worsening economic conditions, including inflation, recession, or other changes in economic conditions, may cause lower it spending and adversely affect our revenue. if demand for pcs, servers, and other computing devices declines, or consumer or business spending for those products declines, our revenue will be adversely affected. substantial revenue comes from our u.s. government contracts. an extended federal government shutdown resulting from failing to pass budget appropriations, adopt continuing funding resolutions or raise the debt ceiling, and other budgetary decisions limiting or delaying federal government spending, could reduce government it spending on our products and services and adversely affect our revenue.  our product distribution system relies on an extensive partner and retail network. oems building devices that run our software have also been a significant means of distribution. the impact of economic conditions on our partners, such as the bankruptcy of a major distributor, oem, or retailer, could cause sales channel disruption.  challenging economic conditions also may impair the ability of our customers to pay for products and services they have purchased. as a result, allowances for doubtful accounts and write-offs of accounts receivable may increase.  27part i item 1a \u00a0 we maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings, types, and maturities. these investments are subject to general credit, liquidity, market, and interest rate risks, which may be exacerbated by market downturns or events that affect global financial markets. a significant part of our investment portfolio comprises u.s. government securities. if global financial markets decline for long periods, or if there is a downgrade of the u.s. government credit rating due to an actual or threatened default on government debt, our investment portfolio may be adversely affected and we could determine that more of our investments have experienced an other-than-temporary decline in fair value, requiring impairment charges that could adversely affect our consolidated financial statements. catastrophic events or geopolitical conditions may disrupt our business.\u00a0a disruption or failure of our systems or operations because of a major earthquake, weather event, cyberattack, terrorist attack, or other catastrophic event could cause delays in completing sales, providing services, or performing other critical functions. our corporate headquarters, a significant portion of our research and development activities, and certain other essential business operations are in the seattle, washington area, and we have other business operations in the silicon valley area of california, both of which are seismically active regions. a catastrophic event that results in the destruction or disruption of any of our critical business or it systems, or the infrastructure or systems they rely on, such as power grids, could harm our ability to conduct normal business operations. providing our customers with more services and solutions in the cloud puts a premium on the resilience of our systems and strength of our business continuity management plans, and magnifies the potential impact of prolonged service outages on our consolidated financial statements.  abrupt political change, terrorist activity, and armed conflict pose a risk of general economic disruption in affected countries, which may increase our operating costs. these conditions also may add uncertainty to the timing and budget for technology investment decisions by our customers, and may cause supply chain disruptions for hardware manufacturers. geopolitical change may result in changing regulatory requirements that could impact our operating strategies, access to global markets, hiring, and profitability. geopolitical instability may lead to sanctions and impact our ability to do business in some markets or with some public-sector customers. any of these changes may negatively impact our revenues.  the long-term effects of climate change on the global economy or the it industry in particular are unclear. environmental regulations or changes in the supply, demand or available sources of energy or other natural resources may affect the availability or cost of goods and services, including natural resources, necessary to run our business. changes in weather where we operate may increase the costs of powering and cooling computer hardware we use to develop software and provide cloud-based services. our business depends on our ability to attract and retain talented employees.\u00a0our business is based on successfully attracting and retaining talented employees representing diverse backgrounds, experiences, and skill sets. the market for highly skilled workers and leaders in our industry is extremely competitive. maintaining our brand and reputation, as well as a diverse and inclusive work environment that enables all our employees to thrive, are important to our ability to recruit and retain employees. we are also limited in our ability to recruit internationally by restrictive domestic immigration laws. changes to u.s. immigration policies that restrain the flow of technical and professional talent may inhibit our ability to adequately staff our research and development efforts. if we are less successful in our recruiting efforts, or if we cannot retain highly skilled workers and key leaders, our ability to develop and deliver successful products and services may be adversely affected. effective succession planning is also important to our long-term success. failure to ensure effective transfer of knowledge and smooth transitions involving key employees could hinder our strategic planning and execution. how employment-related laws are interpreted and applied to our workforce practices may result in increased operating costs and less flexibility in how we meet our workforce needs.  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 28part ii item 7 \u00a0 on december 22, 2017, the tax cuts and jobs act (\u201ctcja\u201d) was enacted into law, which significantly changed existing u.s. tax law and included numerous provisions that affect our business. we recorded a provisional net charge related to the enactment of the tcja of $13.7 billion in fiscal year 2018, and adjusted our provisional net charge by recording additional tax expense of $157 million in the second quarter of fiscal year 2019. in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2019, in response to the tcja and recently issued regulations, we transferred certain intangible properties held by our foreign subsidiaries to the u.s. and ireland, which resulted in a $2.6 billion net income tax benefit. refer to note 12 \u2013 income taxes of the notes to financial statements (part ii, item\u00a08 of this form 10-k) for further discussion. industry trends  our industry is dynamic and highly competitive, with frequent changes in both technologies and business models. each industry shift is an opportunity to conceive new products, new technologies, or new ideas that can further transform the industry and our business. at microsoft, we push the boundaries of what is possible through a broad range of research and development activities that seek to identify and address the changing demands of customers and users, industry trends, and competitive forces. economic conditions, challenges, and risks the markets for software, devices, and cloud-based services are dynamic and highly competitive. our competitors are developing new software and devices, while also deploying competing cloud-based services for consumers and businesses. the devices and form factors customers prefer evolve rapidly, and influence how users access services in the cloud, and in some cases, the user\u2019s choice of which suite of cloud-based services to use. we must continue to evolve and adapt over an extended time in pace with this changing environment. the investments we are making in infrastructure and devices will continue to increase our operating costs and may decrease our operating margins. our success is highly dependent on our ability to attract and retain qualified employees. we hire a mix of university and industry talent worldwide. we compete for talented individuals globally by offering an exceptional working environment, broad customer reach, scale in resources, the ability to grow one\u2019s career across many different products and businesses, and competitive compensation and benefits. aggregate demand for our software, services, and devices is correlated to global macroeconomic and geopolitical factors, which remain dynamic. our international operations provide a significant portion of our total revenue and expenses. many of these revenue and expenses are denominated in currencies other than the u.s. dollar. as a result, changes in foreign exchange rates may significantly affect revenue and expenses. strengthening of foreign currencies relative to the u.s. dollar throughout fiscal year 2018 positively impacted reported revenue and increased reported expenses from our international operations. strengthening of the u.s. dollar relative to certain foreign currencies did not significantly impact reported revenue or expenses from our international operations in the first and second quarters of fiscal year 2019, and reduced reported revenue and expenses from our international operations in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal year 2019. refer to risk factors (part i, item\u00a01a of this form 10-k) for a discussion of these factors and other risks. seasonality our revenue fluctuates quarterly and is generally higher in the second and fourth quarters of our fiscal year. second quarter revenue is driven by corporate year-end spending trends in our major markets and holiday season spending by consumers, and fourth quarter revenue is driven by the volume of multi-year on-premises contracts executed during the period. reportable segments we report our financial performance based on the following segments: productivity and business processes, intelligent cloud, and more personal computing. the segment amounts included in md&a are presented on a basis consistent with our internal management reporting. all differences between our internal management reporting basis and accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america (\u201cgaap\u201d), along with certain corporate-level and other activity, are included in corporate and other. additional information on our reportable segments is contained in note 20 \u2013 segment information and geographic data of the notes to financial statements (part ii, item\u00a08 of this form 10-k). 33part ii item 7 \u00a0 summary results of operations \u00a0   \u00a0 non-gaap operating income, net income, and diluted earnings per share (\u201ceps\u201d) exclude the net tax impact of transfer of intangible properties, the net tax impact of the tcja, and restructuring expenses. refer to the non-gaap financial measures section below for a reconciliation of our financial results reported in accordance with gaap to non-gaap financial results. fiscal year 2019 compared with fiscal year 2018 revenue increased $15.5 billion or 14%, driven by growth across each of our segments. intelligent cloud revenue increased, driven by server products and cloud services. productivity and business processes revenue increased, driven by office and linkedin. more personal computing revenue increased, driven by surface, gaming, and windows. gross margin increased $10.9 billion or 15%, driven by growth across each of our segments. gross margin percentage increased slightly, due to gross margin percentage improvement across each of our segments and favorable segment sales mix. gross margin included a 5 percentage point improvement in commercial cloud, primarily from azure. operating income increased $7.9 billion or 23%, driven by growth across each of our segments. key changes in expenses were:       current year net income included a $2.6 billion net income tax benefit related to intangible property transfers and a $157 million net charge related to the enactment of the tcja, which together resulted in an increase to net income and diluted eps of $2.4 billion and $0.31, respectively. prior year net income and diluted eps were negatively impacted by the net charge related to the enactment of the tcja, which resulted in a decrease to net income and diluted eps of $13.7 billion and $1.75, respectively.  fiscal year 2018 compared with fiscal year 2017 revenue increased $13.8 billion or 14%, driven by growth across each of our segments. productivity and business processes revenue increased, driven by linkedin and higher revenue from office. intelligent cloud revenue increased, primarily due to higher revenue from server products and cloud services. more personal computing revenue increased, driven by higher revenue from gaming, windows, search advertising, and surface, offset in part by lower revenue from phone. 34part ii item 7 \u00a0 gross margin increased $9.7 billion or 16%, due to growth across each of our segments. gross margin percentage increased slightly, driven by favorable segment sales mix and gross margin percentage improvement in more personal computing. gross margin included a 7 percentage point improvement in commercial cloud, primarily from azure. operating income increased $6.0 billion or 21%, driven by growth across each of our segments. linkedin operating loss increased $63 million to $987 million, including $1.5 billion of amortization of intangible assets. operating income included a favorable foreign currency impact of 2%. key changes in expenses were:         fiscal year 2018 net income and diluted eps were negatively impacted by the net charge related to the enactment of the tcja, which resulted in a decrease to net income and diluted earnings per share of $13.7 billion and $1.75, respectively. fiscal year 2017 operating income, net income, and diluted eps were negatively impacted by restructuring expenses, which resulted in a decrease to operating income, net income, and diluted eps of $306 million, $243 million, and $0.04, respectively. segment results of operations    \u00a0   reportable segments  fiscal year 2019 compared with fiscal year 2018 productivity and business processes  revenue increased $5.3 billion or 15%.    35part ii item 7 \u00a0       operating income increased $3.3 billion or 25%, including an unfavorable foreign currency impact of 2%.     intelligent cloud  revenue increased $6.8 billion or 21%.      operating income increased $2.4 billion or 21%.      more personal computing  revenue increased $3.4

intelligent cloud revenue increased $4.8 billion or 18%.     operating income increased $2.4 billion or 26%.     more personal computing  revenue increased $3.0 billion or 8%.     37part ii item 7 \u00a0       operating income increased $1.8 billion or 20%, including a favorable foreign currency impact of 2%.      corporate and other  corporate and other includes corporate-level activity not specifically allocated to a segment, including restructuring expenses. fiscal year 2019 compared with fiscal year 2018  we did not incur corporate and other activity in fiscal years 2019 or 2018. fiscal year 2018 compared with fiscal year 2017  corporate and other operating loss decreased $306 million, due to a reduction in restructuring expenses, driven by employee severance expenses primarily related to our sales and marketing restructuring plan in fiscal year 2017. operating expenses research and development  \u00a0   \u00a0 research and development expenses include payroll, employee benefits, stock-based compensation expense, and other headcount-related expenses associated with product development. research and development expenses also include third-party development and programming costs, localization costs incurred to translate software for international markets, and the amortization of purchased software code and services content.  fiscal year 2019 compared with fiscal year 2018 research and development expenses increased $2.2 billion or 15%, driven by investments in cloud and ai engineering, gaming, linkedin, and github. fiscal year 2018 compared with fiscal year 2017 research and development expenses increased $1.7 billion or 13%, primarily due to investments in cloud engineering and linkedin expenses. linkedin expenses increased $762 million to $1.5 billion. 38part ii item 7 \u00a0 sales and marketing  \u00a0   \u00a0 sales and marketing expenses include payroll, employee benefits, stock-based compensation expense, and other headcount-related expenses associated with sales and marketing personnel, and the costs of advertising, promotions, trade shows, seminars, and other programs.  fiscal year 2019 compared with fiscal year 2018 sales and marketing expenses increased $744 million or 4%, driven by investments in commercial sales capacity, linkedin, and github, offset in part by a decrease in marketing. expenses included a favorable foreign currency impact of 2%.  fiscal year 2018 compared with fiscal year 2017 sales and marketing expenses increased $2.0 billion or 13%, primarily due to linkedin expenses and investments in commercial sales capacity, offset in part by a decrease in windows marketing expenses. linkedin expenses increased $1.2 billion to $2.5 billion, including $617 million of amortization of acquired intangible assets. general and administrative  \u00a0   \u00a0 general and administrative expenses include payroll, employee benefits, stock-based compensation expense, severance expense, and other headcount-related expenses associated with finance, legal, facilities, certain human resources and other administrative personnel, certain taxes, and legal and other administrative fees. fiscal year 2019 compared with fiscal year 2018 general and administrative expenses increased $131 million or 3%. fiscal year 2018 compared with fiscal year 2017 general and administrative expenses increased $273 million or 6%, primarily due to linkedin expenses. linkedin expenses increased $234 million to $528 million. restructuring expenses restructuring expenses include employee severance expenses and other costs associated with the consolidation of facilities and manufacturing operations related to restructuring activities. fiscal year 2019 compared with fiscal year 2018 we did not incur restructuring expenses in fiscal years 2019 or 2018. fiscal year 2018 compared with fiscal year 2017  during fiscal year 2017, we recorded $306 million of employee severance expenses, primarily related to our sales and marketing restructuring plan.  39part ii item 7 \u00a0 other income (expense), net  the components of other income (expense), net were as follows:  \u00a0   we use derivative instruments to: manage risks related to foreign currencies, equity prices, interest rates, and credit; enhance investment returns; and facilitate portfolio diversification. gains and losses from changes in fair values of derivatives that are not designated as hedging instruments are primarily recognized in other income (expense), net.  fiscal year 2019 compared with fiscal year 2018 interest and dividends income increased primarily due to higher yields on fixed-income securities. interest expense decreased primarily driven by a decrease in outstanding long-term debt due to debt maturities, offset in part by higher finance lease expense. net recognized gains on investments decreased primarily due to lower gains on sales of equity investments. net gains on derivatives includes gains on foreign exchange and interest rate derivatives in the current period as compared to losses in the prior period.  fiscal year 2018 compared with fiscal year 2017 dividends and interest income increased primarily due to higher average portfolio balances and yields on fixed-income securities. interest expense increased primarily due to higher average outstanding long-term debt and higher finance lease expense. net recognized gains on investments decreased primarily due to higher losses on sales of fixed-income securities, offset in part by higher gains on sales of equity securities. net losses on derivatives decreased primarily due to lower losses on equity, foreign exchange, and commodity derivatives, offset in part by losses on interest rate derivatives in the current period as compared to gains in the prior period.  income taxes  effective tax rate fiscal year 2019 compared with fiscal year 2018  our effective tax rate for fiscal years 2019 and 2018 was 10% and 55%, respectively. the decrease in our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2019 compared to fiscal year 2018 was primarily due to the net charge related to the enactment of the tcja in the second quarter of fiscal year 2018 and a $2.6 billion net income tax benefit in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2019 related to intangible property transfers. our effective tax rate was lower than the u.s. federal statutory rate, primarily due to the tax benefit related to intangible property transfers, and earnings taxed at lower rates in foreign jurisdictions resulting from producing and distributing our products and services through our foreign regional operations centers in ireland, singapore, and puerto rico. the mix of income before income taxes between the u.s. and foreign countries impacted our effective tax rate as a result of the geographic distribution of, and customer demand for, our products and services. in fiscal year 2019, our u.s. income before income taxes was $15.8 billion and our foreign income before income taxes was $27.9 billion. in fiscal year 2018, our u.s. income before income taxes was $11.5 billion and our foreign income before income taxes was $24.9 billion. 40part ii item 7 \u00a0 fiscal year 2018 compared with fiscal year 2017  our effective tax rate for fiscal years 2018 and 2017 was 55% and 15%, respectively.\u00a0the increase in our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2018 compared to fiscal year 2017 was primarily due to the net charge related to the enactment of the tcja in fiscal year 2018 and the realization of tax benefits attributable to previous phone business losses in fiscal year 2017. our effective tax rate was higher than the u.s. federal statutory rate primarily due to the net charge related to the enactment of the tcja, offset in part by earnings taxed at lower rates in foreign jurisdictions resulting from our foreign regional operations centers in ireland, singapore, and puerto rico.  the mix of income before income taxes between the u.s. and foreign countries impacted our effective tax rate as a result of the geographic distribution of, and customer demand for, our products and services. in fiscal year 2018, our u.s. income before income taxes was $11.5 billion and our foreign income before income taxes was $24.9 billion. in fiscal year 2017, our u.s. income before income taxes was $6.8 billion and our foreign income before income taxes was $23.1 billion. tax cuts and jobs act  on december 22, 2017, the tcja was enacted into law, which significantly changed existing u.s. tax law and included numerous provisions that affect our business, such as imposing a one-time transition tax on deemed repatriation of deferred foreign income, reducing the u.s. federal statutory tax rate, and adopting a territorial tax system. in fiscal year 2018, the tcja required us to incur a transition tax on deferred foreign income not previously subject to u.s. income tax at a rate of 15.5% for foreign cash and certain other net current assets, and 8% on the remaining income. the tcja reduced the u.s. federal statutory tax rate from 35% to 21% effective january 1, 2018. in addition, the tcja subjected us to a tax on our global intangible low-taxed income (\u201cgilti\u201d) effective july 1, 2018. under gaap, we can make an accounting policy election to either treat taxes due on the gilti inclusion as a current period expense or factor such amounts into our measurement of deferred taxes. we elected the deferred method, under which we recorded the corresponding deferred tax assets and liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. during fiscal year 2018, we recorded a net charge of $13.7 billion related to the enactment of the tcja, due to the impact of the one-time transition tax on the deemed repatriation of deferred foreign income of $17.9 billion, offset in part by the impact of changes in the tax rate of $4.2 billion, primarily on deferred tax assets and liabilities. during the second quarter of fiscal year 2019, we recorded additional tax expense of $157 million, which related to completing our provisional accounting for gilti deferred taxes pursuant to securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin no. 118.\u00a0\u00a0 in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2019, in response to the tcja and recently issued regulations, we transferred certain intangible properties held by our foreign subsidiaries to the u.s. and ireland. the transfers of intangible properties resulted in a $2.6 billion net income tax benefit recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2019, as the value of future tax deductions exceeded the current tax liability from foreign jurisdictions and u.s. gilti tax. refer to note 12 \u2013 income taxes of the notes to financial statements (part ii, item\u00a08 of this form 10-k) for further discussion. 41part ii item 7 \u00a0 uncertain tax positions we settled a portion of the internal revenue service (\u201cirs\u201d) audit for tax years 2004 to 2006 in fiscal year 2011. in february 2012, the irs withdrew its 2011 revenue agents report related to unresolved issues for tax years 2004 to 2006 and reopened the audit phase of the examination. we also settled a portion of the irs audit for tax years 2007 to 2009 in fiscal year 2016, and a portion of the irs audit for tax years 2010 to 2013 in fiscal year 2018. we remain under audit for tax years 2004 to 2013. we expect the irs to begin an examination of tax years 2014 to 2017 within the next 12 months.  as of june 30, 2019, the primary unresolved issues for the irs audits relate to transfer pricing, which could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements when the matters are resolved. we believe our allowances for income tax contingencies are adequate. we have not received a proposed assessment for the unresolved issues and do not expect a final resolution of these issues in the next 12 months.\u00a0based on the information currently available, we do not anticipate a significant increase or decrease to our tax contingencies for these issues within the next 12 months. we are subject to income tax in many jurisdictions outside the u.s. our operations in certain jurisdictions remain subject to examination for tax years 1996 to 2018, some of which are currently under audit by local tax authorities. the resolution of each of these audits is not expected to be material to our consolidated financial statements. non-gaap financial measures non-gaap operating income, net income, and diluted eps are non-gaap financial measures which exclude the net tax impact of transfer of intangible properties, the net tax impact of the tcja, and restructuring expenses. we believe these non-gaap measures aid investors by providing additional insight into our operational performance and help clarify trends affecting our business. for comparability of reporting, management considers non-gaap measures in conjunction with gaap financial results in evaluating business performance. these non-gaap financial measures presented should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, the measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with gaap. the following table reconciles our financial results reported in accordance with gaap to non-gaap financial results: \u00a0   \u00a0   42part ii item 7 \u00a0 financial condition  cash, cash equivalents, and investments  cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments totaled $133.8 billion as of both june 30, 2019 and 2018. equity investments were $2.6 billion and $1.9 billion as of june 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively. our short-term investments are primarily intended to facilitate liquidity and capital preservation. they consist predominantly of highly liquid investment-grade fixed-income securities, diversified among industries and individual issuers. the investments are predominantly u.s. dollar-denominated securities, but also include foreign currency-denominated securities to diversify risk. our fixed-income investments are exposed to interest rate risk and credit risk. the credit risk and average maturity of our fixed-income portfolio are managed to achieve economic returns that correlate to certain fixed-income indices. the settlement risk related to these investments is insignificant given that the short-term investments held are primarily highly liquid investment-grade fixed-income securities.  valuation  in general, and where applicable, we use quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities to determine the fair value of our financial instruments. this pricing methodology applies to our level 1 investments, such as u.s. government securities, common and preferred stock, and mutual funds. if quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities are not available to determine fair value, then we use quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities or inputs other than the quoted prices that are observable either directly or indirectly. this pricing methodology applies to our level 2 investments, such as commercial paper, certificates of deposit, u.s. agency securities, foreign government bonds, mortgage- and asset-backed securities, corporate notes and bonds, and municipal securities. level 3 investments are valued using internally-developed models with unobservable inputs. assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis using unobservable inputs are an immaterial portion of our portfolio.  a majority of our investments are priced by pricing vendors and are generally level 1 or level 2 investments as these vendors either provide a quoted market price in an active market or use observable inputs for their pricing without applying significant adjustments. broker pricing is used mainly when a quoted price is not available, the investment is not priced by our pricing vendors, or when a broker price is more reflective of fair values in the market in which the investment trades. our broker-priced investments are generally classified as level 2 investments because the broker prices these investments based on similar assets without applying significant adjustments. in addition, all our broker-priced investments have a sufficient level of trading volume to demonstrate that the fair values used are appropriate for these investments. our fair value processes include controls that are designed to ensure appropriate fair values are recorded. these controls include model validation, review of key model inputs, analysis of period-over-period fluctuations, and independent recalculation of prices where appropriate.  cash flows  fiscal year 2019 compared with fiscal year 2018  cash from operations increased $8.3 billion to $52.2 billion for fiscal year 2019, mainly due to an increase in cash received from customers, offset in part by an increase in cash paid to suppliers and employees and an increase in cash paid for income taxes. cash used in financing increased $3.3 billion to $36.9 billion for fiscal year 2019, mainly due to an $8.8 billion increase in common stock repurchases and a $1.1 billion increase in dividends paid, offset in part by a $6.2 billion decrease in repayments of debt, net of proceeds from issuance of debt. cash used in investing increased $9.7 billion to $15.8 billion for fiscal year 2019, mainly due to a $6.0 billion decrease in cash from net investment purchases, sales, and maturities, a $2.3 billion increase in additions to property and equipment, and a $1.5 billion increase in cash used for acquisitions of companies, net of cash acquired, and purchases of intangible and other assets. 43part ii item 7 \u00a0 fiscal year 2018 compared with fiscal year 2017  cash from operations increased $4.4 billion to $43.9 billion for fiscal year 2018, mainly due to an increase in cash received from customers, offset in part by an increase in cash paid to employees, net cash paid for income taxes, cash paid for interest on debt, and cash paid to suppliers. cash used in financing was $33.6 billion for fiscal year 2018, compared to cash from financing of $8.4 billion for fiscal year 2017. the change was mainly due to a $41.7 billion decrease in proceeds from issuance of debt, net of repayments of debt, offset in part by a $1.1 billion decrease in cash used for common stock repurchases. cash used in investing decreased $40.7 billion to $6.1 billion for fiscal year 2018, mainly due to a $25.1 billion decrease in cash used for acquisitions of companies, net of cash acquired, and purchases of intangible and other assets, and a $19.1 billion increase in cash from net investment purchases, sales, and maturities. debt  we issue debt to take advantage of favorable pricing and liquidity in the debt markets, reflecting our credit rating and the low interest rate environment. the proceeds of these issuances were or will be used for general corporate purposes, which may include, among other things, funding for working capital, capital expenditures, repurchases of capital stock, acquisitions, and repayment of existing debt. refer to note 11 \u2013 debt of the notes to financial statements (part ii, item\u00a08 of this form 10-k) for further discussion.  unearned revenue  unearned revenue comprises mainly unearned revenue related to volume licensing programs, which may include software assurance (\u201csa\u201d) and cloud services. unearned revenue is generally invoiced annually at the beginning of each contract period for multi-year agreements and recognized ratably over the coverage period. unearned revenue also includes payments for other offerings for which we have been paid in advance and earn the revenue when we transfer control of the product or service. refer to note 1 \u2013 accounting policies of the notes to financial statements (part ii, item 8 of this form 10-k) for further discussion. the following table outlines the expected future recognition of unearned revenue as of june 30, 2019: \u00a0   if our customers choose to license cloud-based versions of our products and services rather than licensing transaction-based products and services, the associated revenue will shift from being recognized at the time of the transaction to being recognized over the subscription period or upon consumption, as applicable.  share repurchases  for fiscal years 2019, 2018, and 2017, we repurchased 150 million shares, 99 million shares, and 170 million shares of our common stock for $16.8 billion, $8.6 billion, and $10.3 billion, respectively, through our share repurchase programs. all repurchases were made using cash resources. refer to note 17 \u2013 stockholders\u2019 equity of the notes to financial statements (part ii, item\u00a08 of this form 10-k) for further discussion. dividends  refer to note 17 \u2013 stockholders\u2019 equity of the notes to financial statements (part ii, item\u00a08 of this form 10-k) for further discussion. 44part ii item 7 \u00a0 off-balance sheet arrangements  we provide indemnifications of varying scope and size to certain customers against claims of intellectual property infringement made by third parties arising from the use of our products and certain other matters. additionally, we have agreed to cover damages resulting from breaches of certain security and privacy commitments in our cloud business. in evaluating estimated losses on these obligations, we consider factors such as the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and our ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss. these obligations did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements during the periods presented.  contractual obligations  the following table summarizes the payments due by fiscal year for our outstanding contractual obligations as of june 30, 2019:  \u00a0   \u00a0             other planned uses of capital  we will continue to invest in sales, marketing, product support infrastructure, and existing and advanced areas of technology, as well as continue making acquisitions that align with our business strategy. additions to property and equipment will continue, including new facilities, datacenters, and computer systems for research and development, sales and marketing, support, and administrative staff. we expect capital expenditures to increase in coming years to support growth in our cloud offerings. we have operating and finance leases for datacenters, corporate offices, research and development facilities, retail stores, and certain equipment. we have not engaged in any related party transactions or arrangements with unconsolidated entities or other persons that are reasonably likely to materially affect liquidity or the availability of capital resources.  liquidity  as a result of the tcja, we are required to pay a one-time transition tax on deferred foreign income not previously subject to u.s. income tax. under the tcja, the transition tax is payable interest free over eight years, with 8% due in each of the first five years, 15% in year six, 20% in year seven, and 25% in year eight. we have paid transition tax of approximately $2.0 billion, which included $1.5 billion for fiscal year 2019. the first installment of the transition tax was paid in fiscal year 2019, and the remaining transition tax of $16.4 billion is payable over the next seven years with a final payment in fiscal year 2026. during the first quarter of fiscal year 2020, we expect to pay $1.2 billion related to the second installment of the transition tax, and $3.5 billion related to the transfer of intangible properties in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2019. 45part ii item 7 \u00a0 we expect existing cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, cash flows from operations, and access to capital markets to continue to be sufficient to fund our operating activities and cash commitments for investing and financing activities, such as dividends, share repurchases, debt maturities, material capital expenditures, and the transition tax related to the tcja, for at least the next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future.  recent accounting guidance  refer to note 1 \u2013 accounting policies of the notes to financial statements (part ii, item\u00a08 of this form 10-k) for further discussion. application of critical accounting policies  our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with gaap. preparing consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. these estimates and assumptions are affected by management\u2019s application of accounting policies. critical accounting policies for us include revenue recognition, impairment of investment securities, goodwill, research and development costs, contingencies, income taxes, and inventories.  revenue recognition  our contracts with customers often include promises to transfer multiple products and services to a customer. determining whether products and services are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately versus together may require significant judgment. when a cloud-based service includes both on-premises software licenses and cloud services, judgment is required to determine whether the software license is considered distinct and accounted for separately, or not distinct and accounted for together with the cloud service and recognized over time. certain cloud services, primarily office 365, depend on a significant level of integration, interdependency, and interrelation between the desktop applications and cloud services, and are accounted for together as one performance obligation. revenue from office 365 is recognized ratably over the period in which the cloud services are provided.  judgment is required to determine the stand-alone selling price (\u201cssp\") for each distinct performance obligation. we use a single amount to estimate ssp for items that are not sold separately, including on-premises licenses sold with sa or software updates provided at no additional charge. we use a range of amounts to estimate ssp when we sell each of the products and services separately and need to determine whether there is a discount to be allocated based on the relative ssp of the various products and services.\u00a0\u00a0 in instances where ssp is not directly observable, such as when we do not sell the product or service separately, we determine the ssp using information that may include market conditions and other observable inputs. we typically have more than one ssp for individual products and services due to the stratification of those products and services by customers and circumstances. in these instances, we may use information such as the size of the customer and geographic region in determining the ssp.\u00a0\u00a0 due to the various benefits from and the nature of our sa program, judgment is required to assess the pattern of delivery, including the exercise pattern of certain benefits across our portfolio of customers.\u00a0\u00a0 our products are generally sold with a right of return, we may provide other credits or incentives, and in certain instances we estimate customer usage of our products and services, which are accounted for as variable consideration when determining the amount of revenue to recognize. returns and credits are estimated at contract inception and updated at the end of each reporting period if additional information becomes available. changes to our estimated variable consideration were not material for the periods presented.  46part ii item 7 \u00a0 impairment of investment securities  we review debt investments quarterly for indicators of other-than-temporary impairment. this determination requires significant judgment. in making this judgment, we employ a systematic methodology quarterly that considers available quantitative and qualitative evidence in evaluating potential impairment of our investments. if the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value, we evaluate, among other factors, general market conditions, credit quality of debt instrument issuers, and the duration and extent to which the fair value is less than cost. we also evaluate whether we have plans to sell the security or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery. in addition, we consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of and business outlook for the investee, including industry and sector performance, changes in technology, and operational and financing cash flow factors. once a decline in fair value is determined to be other-than-temporary, an impairment charge is recorded in other income (expense), net and a new cost basis in the investment is established. if market, industry, and/or investee conditions deteriorate, we may incur future impairments.  equity investments without readily determinable fair values are written down to fair value if a qualitative assessment indicates that the investment is impaired and the fair value of the investment is less than carrying value. we perform a qualitative assessment on a quarterly basis. we are required to estimate the fair value of the investment to determine the amount of the impairment loss. once an investment is determined to be impaired, an impairment charge is recorded in other income (expense), net.  goodwill  we allocate goodwill to reporting units based on the reporting unit expected to benefit from the business combination. we evaluate our reporting units on an annual basis and, if necessary, reassign goodwill using a relative fair value allocation approach. goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level (operating segment or one level below an operating segment) on an annual basis (may 1 for us) and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. these events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate, legal factors, operating performance indicators, competition, or sale or disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit.  application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment, including the identification of reporting units, assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units, assignment of goodwill to reporting units, and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit. the fair value of each reporting unit is estimated primarily through the use of a discounted cash flow methodology. this analysis requires significant judgments, including estimation of future cash flows, which is dependent on internal forecasts, estimation of the long-term rate of growth for our business, estimation of the useful life over which cash flows will occur, and determination of our weighted average cost of capital.  the estimates used to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit change from year to year based on operating results, market conditions, and other factors. changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and goodwill impairment for each reporting unit.  research and development costs  costs incurred internally in researching and developing a computer software product are charged to expense until technological feasibility has been established for the product. once technological feasibility is established, software costs are capitalized until the product is available for general release to customers. judgment is required in determining when technological feasibility of a product is established. we have determined that technological feasibility for our software products is reached after all high-risk development issues have been resolved through coding and testing. generally, this occurs shortly before the products are released to production. the amortization of these costs is included in cost of revenue over the estimated life of the products.  legal and other contingencies  the outcomes of legal proceedings and claims brought against us are subject to significant uncertainty. an estimated loss from a loss contingency such as a legal proceeding or claim is accrued by a charge to income if it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. in determining whether a loss should be accrued we evaluate, among other factors, the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss. changes in these factors could materially impact our consolidated financial statements. 47part ii item 7 \u00a0 income taxes  the objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year, and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entity\u2019s financial statements or tax returns. we recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. accounting literature also provides guidance on derecognition of income tax assets and liabilities, classification of deferred income tax assets and liabilities, accounting for interest and penalties associated with tax positions, and income tax disclosures. judgment is required in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized on our consolidated financial statements or tax returns. variations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could materially impact our consolidated financial statements.  the tcja significantly changes existing u.s. tax law and includes numerous provisions that affect our business. refer to note 12 \u2013 income taxes of the notes to financial statements (part ii, item 8 of this form 10-k) for further discussion. inventories  inventories are stated at average cost, subject to the lower of cost or net realizable value. cost includes materials, labor, and manufacturing overhead related to the purchase and production of inventories. net realizable value is the estimated selling price less estimated costs of completion, disposal, and transportation. we regularly review inventory quantities on hand, future purchase commitments with our suppliers, and the estimated utility of our inventory. these reviews include analysis of demand forecasts, product life cycle status, product development plans, current sales levels, pricing strategy, and component cost trends. if our review indicates a reduction in utility below carrying value, we reduce our inventory to a new cost basis through a charge to cost of revenue. \u00a0 48part ii item 7 \u00a0 statement of management\u2019s responsibility for financial statements  management is responsible for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements and related information that are presented in this report. the consolidated financial statements, which include amounts based on management\u2019s estimates and judgments, have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america.  the company designs and maintains accounting and internal control systems to provide reasonable assurance at reasonable cost that assets are safeguarded against loss from unauthorized use or disposition, and that the financial records are reliable for preparing consolidated financial statements and maintaining accountability for assets. these systems are augmented by written policies, an organizational structure providing division of responsibilities, careful selection and training of qualified personnel, and a program of internal audits.  the company engaged deloitte\u00a0& touche llp, an independent registered public accounting firm, to audit and render an opinion on the consolidated financial statements and internal control over financial reporting in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board (united states).  the board of directors, through its audit committee, consisting solely of independent directors of the company, meets periodically with management, internal auditors, and our independent registered public accounting firm to ensure that each is meeting its responsibilities and to discuss matters concerning internal controls and financial reporting. deloitte\u00a0& touche llp and the internal auditors each have full and free access to the audit committee.  \u00a0   \u00a0 49part ii item 7a \u00a0 item\u00a07a.\u00a0quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk risks  we are exposed to economic risk from foreign exchange rates, interest rates, credit risk, and equity prices. we use derivatives instruments to manage these risks, however, they may still impact our consolidated financial statements.  foreign currency  certain forecasted transactions, assets, and liabilities are exposed to foreign currency risk. we monitor our foreign currency exposures daily to maximize the economic effectiveness of our foreign currency positions. principal currencies hedged include the euro, japanese yen, british pound, canadian dollar, and australian dollar.  interest rate  securities held in our fixed-income portfolio are subject to different interest rate risks based on their maturities. we manage the average maturity of the fixed-income portfolio to achieve economic returns that correlate to certain global fixed-income indices.  credit our fixed-income portfolio is diversified and consists primarily of investment-grade securities. we manage credit exposures relative to broad-based indices and to facilitate portfolio diversification.  equity  securities held in our equity investments portfolio are subject to price risk.\u00a0  sensitivity analysis the following table sets forth the potential loss in future earnings or fair values, including associated derivatives, resulting from hypothetical changes in relevant market rates or prices:  \u00a0   \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 50part ii item 8 \u00a0 comprehensive income statements  \u00a0   \u00a0 refer to accompanying notes. refer to note 18 \u2013 accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) for further information. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 52part ii item 8 \u00a0 notes to financial statements  note 1 \u2014 accounting policies  accounting principles  our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america (\u201cgaap\u201d).  we have recast certain prior period amounts related to investments, derivatives, and fair value measurements to conform to the current period presentation based on our adoption of the new accounting standard for financial instruments. we have recast prior period commercial cloud revenue to include the commercial portion of linkedin to provide a comparable view of our commercial cloud business performance. the commercial portion of linkedin includes linkedin recruiter, sales navigator, premium business subscriptions, and other services for organizations. we have also recast components of the prior period deferred income tax assets and liabilities to conform to the current period presentation. the recast of these prior period amounts had no impact on our consolidated balance sheets, consolidated income statements, or net cash from or used in operating, financing, or investing on our consolidated cash flows statements.  principles of consolidation  the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of microsoft corporation and its subsidiaries. intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated.  estimates and assumptions  preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. examples of estimates and assumptions include: for revenue recognition, determining the nature and timing of satisfaction of performance obligations, and determining the standalone selling price (\u201cssp\u201d) of performance obligations, variable consideration, and other obligations such as product returns and refunds; loss contingencies; product warranties; the fair value of and/or potential impairment of goodwill and intangible assets for our reporting units; product life cycles; useful lives of our tangible and intangible assets; allowances for doubtful accounts; the market value of, and demand for, our inventory; stock-based compensation forfeiture rates; when technological feasibility is achieved for our products; the potential outcome of uncertain tax positions that have been recognized on our consolidated financial statements or tax returns; and determining the timing and amount of impairments for investments. actual results and outcomes may differ from management\u2019s estimates and assumptions.  foreign currencies  assets and liabilities recorded in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rate on the balance sheet date. revenue and expenses are translated at average rates of exchange prevailing during the year. translation adjustments resulting from this process are recorded to other comprehensive income (\u201coci\u201d).  revenue\u00a0\u00a0 product revenue and service and other revenue  product revenue includes sales from operating systems; cross-device productivity applications; server applications; business solution applications; desktop and server management tools; software development tools; video games; and hardware such as pcs, tablets, gaming and entertainment consoles, other intelligent devices, and related accessories.  service and other revenue includes sales from cloud-based solutions that provide customers with software, services, platforms, and content such as microsoft office 365, microsoft azure, microsoft dynamics 365, and xbox live; solution support; and consulting services. service and other revenue also includes sales from online advertising and linkedin. 56part ii item 8 \u00a0 revenue recognition revenue is recognized upon transfer of control of promised products or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those products or services. we enter into contracts that can include various combinations of products and services, which are generally capable of being distinct and accounted for as separate performance obligations. revenue is recognized net of allowances for returns and any taxes collected from customers, which are subsequently remitted to governmental authorities.  nature of products and services licenses for on-premises software provide the customer with a right to use the software as it exists when made available to the customer. customers may purchase perpetual licenses or subscribe to licenses, which provide customers with the same functionality and differ mainly in the duration over which the customer benefits from the software. revenue from distinct on-premises licenses is recognized upfront at the point in time when the software is made available to the customer. in cases where we allocate revenue to software updates, primarily because the updates are provided at no additional charge, revenue is recognized as the updates are provided, which is generally ratably over the estimated life of the related device or license. certain volume licensing programs, including enterprise agreements, include on-premises licenses combined with software assurance (\u201csa\u201d). sa conveys rights to new software and upgrades released over the contract period and provides support, tools, and training to help customers deploy and use products more efficiently. on-premises licenses are considered distinct performance obligations when sold with sa. revenue allocated to sa is generally recognized ratably over the contract period as customers simultaneously consume and receive benefits, given that sa comprises distinct performance obligations that are satisfied over time.\u00a0\u00a0 cloud services, which allow customers to use hosted software over the contract period without taking possession of the software, are provided on either a subscription or consumption basis. revenue related to cloud services provided on a subscription basis is recognized ratably over the contract period. revenue related to cloud services provided on a consumption basis, such as the amount of storage used in a period, is recognized based on the customer utilization of such resources. when cloud services require a significant level of integration and interdependency with software and the individual components are not considered distinct, all revenue is recognized over the period in which the cloud services are provided.  revenue from search advertising is recognized when the advertisement appears in the search results or when the action necessary to earn the revenue has been completed. revenue from consulting services is recognized as services are provided.  our hardware is generally highly dependent on, and interrelated with, the underlying operating system and cannot function without the operating system. in these cases, the hardware and software license are accounted for as a single performance obligation and revenue is recognized at the point in time when ownership is transferred to resellers or directly to end customers through retail stores and online marketplaces.  refer to note 20 \u2013 segment information and geographic data for further information, including revenue by significant product and service offering. significant judgments our contracts with customers often include promises to transfer multiple products and services to a customer. determining whether products and services are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately versus together may require significant judgment. when a cloud-based service includes both on-premises software licenses and cloud services, judgment is required to determine whether the software license is considered distinct and accounted for separately, or not distinct and accounted for together with the cloud service and recognized over time. certain cloud services, primarily office 365, depend on a significant level of integration, interdependency, and interrelation between the desktop applications and cloud services, and are accounted for together as one performance obligation. revenue from office 365 is recognized ratably over the period in which the cloud services are provided. 57part ii item 8 \u00a0 judgment is required to determine the ssp for each distinct performance obligation. we use a single amount to estimate ssp for items that are not sold separately, including on-premises licenses sold with sa or software updates provided at no additional charge. we use a range of amounts to estimate ssp when we sell each of the products and services separately and need to determine whether there is a discount to be allocated based on the relative ssp of the various products and services.  in instances where ssp is not directly observable, such as when we do not sell the product or service separately, we determine the ssp using information that may include market conditions and other observable inputs. we typically have more than one ssp for individual products and services due to the stratification of those products and services by customers and circumstances. in these instances, we may use information such as the size of the customer and geographic region in determining the ssp.\u00a0\u00a0 due to the various benefits from and the nature of our sa program, judgment is required to assess the pattern of delivery, including the exercise pattern of certain benefits across our portfolio of customers.\u00a0\u00a0 our products are generally sold with a right of return, we may provide other credits or incentives, and in certain instances we estimate customer usage of our products and services, which are accounted for as variable consideration when determining the amount of revenue to recognize. returns and credits are estimated at contract inception and updated at the end of each reporting period if additional information becomes available. changes to our estimated variable consideration were not material for the periods presented. contract balances\u00a0\u00a0 timing of revenue recognition may differ from the timing of invoicing to customers. we record a receivable when revenue is recognized prior to invoicing, or unearned revenue when revenue is recognized subsequent to invoicing. for multi-year agreements, we generally invoice customers annually at the beginning of each annual coverage period. we record a receivable related to revenue recognized for multi-year on-premises licenses as we have an unconditional right to invoice and receive payment in the future related to those licenses.  as of june 30, 2019 and 2018, long-term accounts receivable, net of allowance for doubtful accounts, was $2.2 billion and $1.8 billion, respectively, and is included in other long-term assets in our consolidated balance sheets. the allowance for doubtful accounts reflects our best estimate of probable losses inherent in the accounts receivable balance. we determine the allowance based on known troubled accounts, historical experience, and other currently available evidence.  activity in the allowance for doubtful accounts was as follows:\u00a0 \u00a0   \u00a0 allowance for doubtful accounts included in our consolidated balance sheets: \u00a0   \u00a0 58part ii item 8 \u00a0 unearned revenue comprises mainly unearned revenue related to volume licensing programs, which may include sa and cloud services. unearned revenue is generally invoiced annually at the beginning of each contract period for multi-year agreements and recognized ratably over the coverage period. unearned revenue also includes payments for consulting services to be performed in the future; linkedin subscriptions; office 365 subscriptions; xbox live subscriptions; windows 10 post-delivery support; dynamics business solutions; skype prepaid credits and subscriptions; and other offerings for which we have been paid in advance and earn the revenue when we transfer control of the product or service.  refer to note 14 \u2013 unearned revenue for further information, including unearned revenue by segment and changes in unearned revenue during the period. payment terms and conditions vary by contract type, although terms generally include a requirement of payment within 30 to 60 days. in instances where the timing of revenue recognition differs from the timing of invoicing, we have determined our contracts generally do not include a significant financing component. the primary purpose of our invoicing terms is to provide customers with simplified and predictable ways of purchasing our products and services, not to receive financing from our customers or to provide customers with financing. examples include invoicing at the beginning of a subscription term with revenue recognized ratably over the contract period, and multi-year on-premises licenses that are invoiced annually with revenue recognized upfront. assets recognized from costs to obtain a contract with a customer we recognize an asset for the incremental costs of obtaining a contract with a customer if we expect the benefit of those costs to be longer than one year. we have determined that certain sales incentive programs meet the requirements to be capitalized. total capitalized costs to obtain a contract were immaterial during the periods presented and are included in other current and long-term assets in our consolidated balance sheets.  we apply a practical expedient to expense costs as incurred for costs to obtain a contract with a customer when the amortization period would have been one year or less. these costs include our internal sales force compensation program and certain partner sales incentive programs as we have determined annual compensation is commensurate with annual sales activities. cost of revenue  cost of revenue includes: manufacturing and distribution costs for products sold and programs licensed; operating costs related to product support service centers and product distribution centers; costs incurred to include software on pcs sold by original equipment manufacturers (\u201coem\u201d), to drive traffic to our websites, and to acquire online advertising space; costs incurred to support and maintain online products and services, including datacenter costs and royalties; warranty costs; inventory valuation adjustments; costs associated with the delivery of consulting services; and the amortization of capitalized software development costs. capitalized software development costs are amortized over the estimated lives of the products.  product warranty  we provide for the estimated costs of fulfilling our obligations under hardware and software warranties at the time the related revenue is recognized. for hardware warranties, we estimate the costs based on historical and projected product failure rates, historical and projected repair costs, and knowledge of specific product failures (if any). the specific hardware warranty terms and conditions vary depending upon the product sold and the country in which we do business, but generally include parts and labor over a period generally ranging from 90\u00a0days to three years. for software warranties, we estimate the costs to provide bug fixes, such as security patches, over the estimated life of the software. we regularly reevaluate our estimates to assess the adequacy of the recorded warranty liabilities and adjust the amounts as necessary.  59part ii item 8 \u00a0 research and development  research and development expenses include payroll, employee benefits, stock-based compensation expense, and other headcount-related expenses associated with product development. research and development expenses also include third-party development and programming costs, localization costs incurred to translate software for international markets, and the amortization of purchased software code and services content. such costs related to software development are included in research and development expense until the point that technological feasibility is reached, which for our software products, is generally shortly before the products are released to production. once technological feasibility is reached, such costs are capitalized and amortized to cost of revenue over the estimated lives of the products.  sales and marketing  sales and marketing expenses include payroll, employee benefits, stock-based compensation expense, and other headcount-related expenses associated with sales and marketing personnel, and the costs of advertising, promotions, trade shows, seminars, and other programs. advertising costs are expensed as incurred. advertising expense was $1.6 billion, $1.6 billion, and $1.5 billion in fiscal years 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively.  stock-based compensation  compensation cost for stock awards, which include restricted stock units (\u201crsus\u201d) and performance stock units (\u201cpsus\u201d), is measured at the fair value on the grant date and recognized as expense, net of estimated forfeitures, over the related service or performance period. the fair value of stock awards is based on the quoted price of our common stock on the grant date less the present value of expected dividends not received during the vesting period. we measure the fair value of psus using a monte carlo valuation model. compensation cost for rsus is recognized using the straight-line method and for psus is recognized using the accelerated method. compensation expense for the employee stock purchase plan (\u201cespp\u201d) is measured as the discount the employee is entitled to upon purchase and is recognized in the period of purchase. income taxes  income tax expense includes u.s. and international income taxes, and interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions. certain income and expenses are not reported in tax returns and financial statements in the same year. the tax effect of such temporary differences is reported as deferred income taxes. deferred tax assets are reported net of a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized. all deferred income taxes are classified as long-term in our consolidated balance sheets.  financial instruments investments we consider all highly liquid interest-earning investments with a maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase to be cash equivalents. the fair values of these investments approximate their carrying values. in general, investments with original maturities of greater than three months and remaining maturities of less than one year are classified as short-term investments. investments with maturities beyond one year may be classified as short-term based on their highly liquid nature and because such marketable securities represent the investment of cash that is available for current operations.  60part ii item 8 \u00a0 debt investments are classified as available-for-sale and realized gains and losses are recorded using the specific identification method. changes in fair value, excluding other-than-temporary impairments, are recorded in oci. debt investments are impaired when a decline in fair value is judged to be other-than-temporary. fair value is calculated based on publicly available market information or other estimates determined by management. we employ a systematic methodology on a quarterly basis that considers available quantitative and qualitative evidence in evaluating potential impairment of our investments. if the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value, we evaluate, among other factors, general market conditions, credit quality of debt instrument issuers, and the duration and extent to which the fair value is less than cost. we also evaluate whether we have plans to sell the security or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery. in addition, we consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of and business outlook for the investee, including industry and sector performance, changes in technology, and operational and financing cash flow factors. once a decline in fair value is determined to be other-than-temporary, an impairment charge is recorded in other income (expense), net and a new cost basis in the investment is established.  equity investments with readily determinable fair values are measured at fair value. equity investments without readily determinable fair values are measured using the equity method, or measured at cost with adjustments for observable changes in price or impairments (referred to as the measurement alternative). we perform a qualitative assessment on a quarterly basis and recognize an impairment if there are sufficient indicators that the fair value of the investment is less than carrying value. changes in value are recorded in other income (expense), net.  we lend certain fixed-income and equity securities to increase investment returns. these transactions are accounted for as secured borrowings and the loaned securities continue to be carried as investments on our consolidated balance sheets. cash and/or security interests are received as collateral for the loaned securities with the amount determined based upon the underlying security lent and the creditworthiness of the borrower. cash received is recorded as an asset with a corresponding liability.  derivatives derivative instruments are recognized as either assets or liabilities and measured at fair value. the accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation.  for derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges, gains and losses are recognized in other income (expense), net with offsetting gains and losses on the hedged items.  for derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges, the effective portion of the gains and losses are initially reported as a component of oci and subsequently recognized in revenue when the hedged exposure is recognized in revenue. gains and losses on derivatives representing either hedge components excluded from the assessment of effectiveness or hedge ineffectiveness are recognized in other income (expense), net.  for derivative instruments that are not designated as hedges, gains and losses from changes in fair values are primarily recognized in other income (expense), net. fair value measurements we account for certain assets and liabilities at fair value. the hierarchy below lists three levels of fair value based on the extent to which inputs used in measuring fair value are observable in the market.\u00a0we categorize each of our fair value measurements in one of these three levels based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. these levels are:    61part ii item 8 \u00a0     we measure equity investments without readily determinable fair values on a nonrecurring basis. the fair values of these investments are determined based on valuation techniques using the best information available, and may include quoted market prices, market comparables, and discounted cash flow projections.   our other current financial assets and current financial liabilities have fair values that approximate their carrying values. inventories  inventories are stated at average cost, subject to the lower of cost or net realizable value. cost includes materials, labor, and manufacturing overhead related to the purchase and production of inventories. net realizable value is the estimated selling price less estimated costs of completion, disposal, and transportation. we regularly review inventory quantities on hand, future purchase commitments with our suppliers, and the estimated utility of our inventory. if our review indicates a reduction in utility below carrying value, we reduce our inventory to a new cost basis through a charge to cost of revenue.  property and equipment  property and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation, and depreciated using the straight-line method over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the asset or the lease term. the estimated useful lives of our property and equipment are generally as follows: computer software developed or acquired for internal use, three to seven years; computer equipment, two to three years; buildings and improvements, five to 15 years; leasehold improvements, three to 20 years; and furniture and equipment, one to 10 years. land is not depreciated.  leases we determine if an arrangement is a lease at inception. operating leases are included in operating lease right-of-use (\u201crou\u201d) assets, other current liabilities, and operating lease liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets. finance leases are included in property and equipment, other current liabilities, and other long-term liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets.\u00a0\u00a0 rou assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. operating lease rou assets and liabilities are recognized at commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. as most of our leases do not provide an implicit rate, we generally use our incremental borrowing rate based on the estimated rate of interest for collateralized borrowing over a similar term of the lease payments at commencement date. the operating lease rou asset also includes any lease payments made and excludes lease incentives. our lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. lease expense for lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.  62part ii item 8 \u00a0 we have lease agreements with lease and non-lease components, which are generally accounted for separately. for certain equipment leases, such as vehicles, we account for the lease and non-lease components as a single lease component. additionally, for certain equipment leases, we apply a portfolio approach to effectively account for the operating lease rou assets and liabilities.  goodwill  goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level (operating segment or one level below an operating segment) on an annual basis (may 1 for us) and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value.  intangible assets  our intangible assets are subject to amortization and are amortized using the straight-line method over their estimated period of benefit, ranging from one to 20 years. we evaluate the recoverability of intangible assets periodically by taking into account events or circumstances that may warrant revised estimates of useful lives or that indicate the asset may be impaired.  recent accounting guidance  recently adopted accounting guidance income taxes \u2013 intra-entity asset transfers in october 2016, the financial accounting standards board (\u201cfasb\u201d) issued new guidance requiring an entity to recognize the income tax consequences of an intra-entity transfer of an asset other than inventory when the transfer occurs, rather than when the asset has been sold to an outside party. we adopted the guidance effective july 1, 2018. adoption of the guidance was applied using a modified retrospective approach through a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the effective date. we recorded a net cumulative-effect adjustment that resulted in an increase in retained earnings of $557 million, which reversed the previous deferral of income tax consequences and recorded new deferred tax assets from intra-entity transfers involving assets other than inventory, partially offset by a u.s. deferred tax liability related to global intangible low-taxed income (\u201cgilti\u201d). adoption of the standard resulted in an increase in long-term deferred tax assets of $2.8 billion, an increase in long-term deferred tax liabilities of $2.1 billion, and a reduction in other current assets of $152 million. adoption of the standard had no impact on cash from or used in operating, financing, or investing on our consolidated cash flows statements. financial instruments \u2013 recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure  in january 2016, the fasb issued a new standard related to certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure of financial instruments. most prominent among the changes in the standard is the requirement for changes in the fair value of our equity investments, with certain exceptions, to be recognized through net income rather than oci.  we adopted the standard effective july\u00a01, 2018. adoption of the standard was applied using a modified retrospective approach through a cumulative-effect adjustment from accumulated other comprehensive income (\u201caoci\u201d) to retained earnings as of the effective date, and we elected to measure equity investments without readily determinable fair values at cost with adjustments for observable changes in price or impairments. the cumulative-effect adjustment included any previously held unrealized gains and losses held in aoci related to our equity investments carried at fair value as well as the impact of recording the fair value of certain equity investments carried at cost. the impact on our consolidated balance sheets upon adoption was not material. adoption of the standard had no impact on cash from or used in operating, financing, or investing on our consolidated cash flows statements. 63part ii item 8 \u00a0 recent accounting guidance not yet adopted  financial instruments \u2013 targeted improvements to accounting for hedging activities  in august 2017, the fasb issued new guidance related to accounting for hedging activities. this guidance expands strategies that qualify for hedge accounting, changes how many hedging relationships are presented in the financial statements, and simplifies the application of hedge accounting in certain situations. the standard will be effective for us beginning july 1, 2019, with early adoption permitted for any interim or annual period before the effective date. adoption of the standard will be applied using a modified retrospective approach through a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the effective date. we evaluated the impact of this standard on our consolidated financial statements, including accounting policies, processes, and systems, and do not expect the impact to be material upon adoption. financial instruments \u2013 credit losses  in june 2016, the fasb issued a new standard to replace the incurred loss impairment methodology under current gaap with a methodology that reflects expected credit losses and requires consideration of a broader range of reasonable and supportable information to inform credit loss estimates. we will be required to use a forward-looking expected credit loss model for accounts receivables, loans, and other financial instruments. credit losses relating to available-for-sale debt securities will also be recorded through an allowance for credit losses rather than as a reduction in the amortized cost basis of the securities. the standard will be adopted upon the effective date for us beginning july 1, 2020. adoption of the standard will be applied using a modified retrospective approach through a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the effective date to align our credit loss methodology with the new standard. we are currently evaluating the impact of this standard on our consolidated financial statements, including accounting policies, processes, and systems.  \u00a0 note 2 \u2014 earnings per share basic earnings per share (\u201ceps\u201d) is computed based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. diluted eps is computed based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock plus the effect of dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period using the treasury stock method. dilutive potential common shares include outstanding stock options and stock awards. the components of basic and diluted eps were as follows: \u00a0   \u00a0 anti-dilutive stock-based awards excluded from the calculations of diluted eps were immaterial during the periods presented. 64part ii item 8 \u00a0 note 3 \u2014 other income (expense), net  the components of other income (expense), net were as follows:  \u00a0   net recognized gains (losses) on investments  net recognized gains (losses) on debt investments were as follows:  \u00a0   \u00a0 net recognized gains (losses) on equity investments were as follows: \u00a0   \u00a0 65part ii item 8 \u00a0 note 4\u00a0\u2014\u00a0investments investment components  the components of investments were as follows:  \u00a0   \u00a0   66part ii item 8 \u00a0   \u00a0   \u00a0 equity investments presented as \u201cother\u201d in the tables above include investments without readily determinable fair values measured using the equity method or measured at cost with adjustments for observable changes in price or impairments, and investments measured at fair value using net asset value as a practical expedient which are not categorized in the fair value hierarchy. as of june 30, 2019 and 2018, equity investments without readily determinable fair values measured at cost with adjustments for observable changes in price or impairments were $1.2 billion and $697 million, respectively.  as of june 30, 2019, we had no collateral received under agreements for loaned securities. as of june 30, 2018, collateral received under agreements for loaned securities was $1.8 billion and primarily comprised u.s. government and agency securities.  unrealized losses on debt investments  debt investments with continuous unrealized losses for less than 12 months and 12 months or greater and their related fair values were as follows:  \u00a0   \u00a0   67part ii item 8 \u00a0   \u00a0 unrealized losses from fixed-income securities are primarily attributable to changes in interest rates. management does not believe any remaining unrealized losses represent other-than-temporary impairments based on our evaluation of available evidence.  debt investment maturities  \u00a0   \u00a0 note 5 \u2014 derivatives  we use derivative instruments to manage risks related to foreign currencies, equity prices, interest rates, and credit; to enhance investment returns; and to facilitate portfolio diversification. our objectives for holding derivatives include reducing, eliminating, and efficiently managing the economic impact of these exposures as effectively as possible. our derivative programs include strategies that both qualify and do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment.  foreign currency  certain forecasted transactions, assets, and liabilities are exposed to foreign currency risk. we monitor our foreign currency exposures daily to maximize the economic effectiveness of our foreign currency hedge positions. option and forward contracts are used to hedge a portion of forecasted international revenue and are designated as cash flow hedging instruments. principal currencies hedged include the euro, japanese yen, british pound, canadian dollar, and australian dollar.  foreign currency risks related to certain non-u.s. dollar denominated securities are hedged using foreign exchange forward contracts that are designated as fair value hedging instruments.  certain options and forwards not designated as hedging instruments are also used to manage the variability in foreign exchange rates on certain balance sheet amounts and to manage other foreign currency exposures.\u00a0  equity  securities held in our equity investments portfolio are subject to market price risk.\u00a0market price risk is managed relative to broad-based global and domestic equity indices using certain convertible preferred investments, options, futures, and swap contracts not designated as hedging instruments. in the past, to hedge our price risk, we also used and designated equity derivatives as hedging instruments, including puts, calls, swaps, and forwards.\u00a0  68part ii item 8 \u00a0 other interest rate  securities held in our fixed-income portfolio are subject to different interest rate risks based on their maturities. we manage the average maturity of our fixed-income portfolio to achieve economic returns that correlate to certain broad-based fixed-income indices using exchange-traded option and futures contracts, and over-the-counter swap and option contracts, none of which are designated as hedging instruments.  in addition, we use \u201cto be announced\u201d forward purchase commitments of mortgage-backed assets to gain exposure to agency mortgage-backed securities.\u00a0these meet the definition of a derivative instrument in cases where physical delivery of the assets is not taken at the earliest available delivery date.  credit  our fixed-income portfolio is diversified and consists primarily of investment-grade securities. we use credit default swap contracts, not designated as hedging instruments, to manage credit exposures relative to broad-based indices and to facilitate portfolio diversification. we use credit default swaps as they are a low-cost method of managing exposure to individual credit risks or groups of credit risks.  credit-risk-related contingent features  certain of our counterparty agreements for derivative instruments contain provisions that require our issued and outstanding long-term unsecured debt to maintain an investment grade credit rating and require us to maintain minimum liquidity of $1.0 billion. to the extent we fail to meet these requirements, we will be required to post collateral, similar to the standard convention related to over-the-counter derivatives. as of june 30, 2019, our long-term unsecured debt rating was aaa, and cash investments were in excess of $1.0 billion. as a result, no collateral was required to be posted.  the following table presents the notional amounts of our outstanding derivative instruments measured in u.s. dollar equivalents: \u00a0   69part ii item 8 \u00a0 fair values of derivative instruments  the following table presents our derivative instruments:  \u00a0   gross derivative assets and liabilities subject to legally enforceable master netting agreements for which we have elected to offset were $247 million and $272 million, respectively, as of june 30, 2019, and $533 million and $207 million, respectively, as of june 30, 2018. \u00a0 the following table presents the fair value of our derivatives instruments on a gross basis: \u00a0   70part ii item 8 \u00a0 fair value hedge gains (losses)  we recognized in other income (expense), net the following gains (losses) on contracts designated as fair value hedges and their related hedged items:  \u00a0   cash flow hedge gains (losses)  we recognized the following gains (losses) on foreign exchange contracts designated as cash flow hedges:  \u00a0   we do not have any net derivative gains included in aoci as of june 30, 2019 that will be reclassified into earnings within the following 12 months. no significant amounts of gains (losses) were reclassified from aoci into earnings as a result of forecasted transactions that failed to occur during fiscal year 2019.  non-designated derivative gains (losses)  we recognized in other income (expense), net the following gains (losses) on derivatives not designated as hedging instruments:  \u00a0   \u00a0 71part ii item 8 \u00a0 note 6 \u2014 inventories  the components of inventories were as follows:  \u00a0   \u00a0 note 7 \u2014 property and equipment  the components of property and equipment were as follows:  \u00a0   \u00a0 during fiscal years 2019, 2018, and 2017, depreciation expense was $9.7 billion, $7.7 billion, and $6.1 billion, respectively. we have committed $4.0 billion for the construction of new buildings, building improvements, and leasehold improvements as of june 30, 2019.  \u00a0 note 8 \u2014 business combinations  github, inc. on october 25, 2018, we acquired github, inc. (\u201cgithub\u201d), a software development platform, in a $7.5 billion stock transaction (inclusive of total cash payments of $1.3 billion in respect of vested github equity awards and an indemnity escrow). the acquisition is expected to empower developers to achieve more at every stage of the development lifecycle, accelerate enterprise use of github, and bring microsoft\u2019s developer tools and services to new audiences. the financial results of github have been included in our consolidated financial statements since the date of the acquisition. github is reported as part of our intelligent cloud segment. 72part ii item 8 \u00a0 the allocation of the purchase price to goodwill was completed as of june 30, 2019. the major classes of assets and liabilities to which we allocated the purchase price were as follows:\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0   the goodwill recognized in connection with the acquisition is primarily attributable to anticipated synergies from future growth and is not expected to be deductible for tax purposes. we assigned the goodwill to our intelligent cloud segment.\u00a0\u00a0 following are the details of the purchase price allocated to the intangible assets acquired:  \u00a0   transactions recognized separately from the purchase price allocation were approximately $600 million, primarily related to equity awards recognized as expense over the related service period.  linkedin corporation on december 8, 2016, we completed our acquisition of all issued and outstanding shares of linkedin corporation (\u201clinkedin\u201d), the world\u2019s largest professional network on the internet, for a total purchase price of $27.0 billion. the purchase price consisted primarily of cash of $26.9 billion. the acquisition is expected to accelerate the growth of linkedin, office 365, and dynamics 365. the financial results of linkedin have been included in our consolidated financial statements since the date of the acquisition.  73part ii item 8 \u00a0 the allocation of the purchase price to goodwill was completed as of june 30, 2017. the major classes of assets and liabilities to which we allocated the purchase price were as follows:\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0   \u00a0     following are the details of the purchase price allocated to the intangible assets acquired:  \u00a0   our consolidated income statements include the following revenue and operating loss attributable to linkedin since the date of acquisition: \u00a0   following are the supplemental consolidated financial results of microsoft corporation on an unaudited pro forma basis, as if the acquisition had been consummated on july\u00a01, 2015:  \u00a0   \u00a0 these pro forma results were based on estimates and assumptions, which we believe are reasonable. they are not the results that would have been realized had we been a combined company during the periods presented and are not necessarily indicative of our consolidated results of operations in future periods. the pro forma results include adjustments related to purchase accounting, primarily amortization of intangible assets. acquisition costs and other nonrecurring charges were immaterial and are included in the earliest period presented. 74part ii item 8 \u00a0 other during fiscal year 2019, we completed 19 additional acquisitions for $1.6 billion, substantially all of which were paid in cash. these entities have been included in our consolidated results of operations since their respective acquisition dates.   note 9 \u2014 goodwill  changes in the carrying amount of goodwill were as follows:  \u00a0   \u00a0   the measurement periods for the valuation of assets acquired and liabilities assumed end as soon as information on the facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition dates becomes available, but do not exceed 12 months. adjustments in purchase price allocations may require a change in the amounts allocated to goodwill during the periods in which the adjustments are determined.  any change in the goodwill amounts resulting from foreign currency translations and purchase accounting adjustments are presented as \u201cother\u201d in the table above. also included in \u201cother\u201d are business dispositions and transfers between segments due to reorganizations, as applicable.  goodwill impairment\u00a0\u00a0 we test goodwill for impairment annually on may\u00a01 at the reporting unit level, primarily using a discounted cash flow methodology with a peer-based, risk-adjusted weighted average cost of capital. we believe use of a discounted cash flow approach is the most reliable indicator of the fair values of the businesses.  no instances of impairment were identified in our may 1, 2019, may 1, 2018, or may 1, 2017 tests. as of june 30, 2019 and 2018, accumulated goodwill impairment was $11.3 billion. note 10\u00a0\u2014\u00a0intangible assets  the components of intangible assets, all of which are finite-lived, were as follows:  \u00a0     no material impairments of intangible assets were identified during fiscal years 2019, 2018, or 2017. we estimate that we have no significant residual value related to our intangible assets.  75part ii item 8 \u00a0 the components of intangible assets acquired during the periods presented were as follows:  \u00a0   \u00a0 intangible assets amortization expense was $1.9 billion, $2.2 billion, and $1.7 billion for fiscal years 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively.  the following table outlines the estimated future amortization expense related to intangible assets held as of june 30, 2019:  \u00a0   \u00a0 note 11\u00a0\u2014\u00a0debt  short-term debt as of june 30, 2019 and 2018, we had no commercial paper issued or outstanding. effective august 31, 2018, we terminated our credit facilities, which served as back-up for our commercial paper program.  long-term debt as of june 30, 2019, the total carrying value and estimated fair value of our long-term debt, including the current portion, were $72.2 billion and $78.9 billion, respectively. as of june 30, 2018, the total carrying value and estimated fair value of our long-term debt, including the current portion, were $76.2 billion and $77.5 billion, respectively. these estimated fair values are based on level 2 inputs.  76part ii item 8 \u00a0 the components of our long-term debt, including the current portion, and the associated interest rates were as follows:  \u00a0     the notes in the table above are senior unsecured obligations and rank equally with our other senior unsecured debt outstanding. interest on these notes is paid semi-annually, except for the euro-denominated debt securities on which interest is paid annually. cash paid for interest on our debt for fiscal years 2019, 2018, and 2017 was $2.4 billion, $2.4 billion, and $1.6 billion, respectively. as of june 30, 2019 and 2018, the aggregate debt issuance costs and unamortized discount associated with our long-term debt, including the current portion, were $603 million and $658 million, respectively.  77part ii item 8 \u00a0 maturities of our long-term debt for each of the next five years and thereafter are as follows:  \u00a0   \u00a0 note 12\u00a0\u2014\u00a0income taxes  tax cuts and jobs act on december 22, 2017, the tax cuts and jobs act (\u201ctcja\u201d) was enacted into law, which significantly changed existing u.s. tax law and included numerous provisions that affect our business, such as imposing a one-time transition tax on deemed repatriation of deferred foreign income, reducing the u.s. federal statutory tax rate, and adopting a territorial tax system. in fiscal year 2018, the tcja required us to incur a transition tax on deferred foreign income not previously subject to u.s. income tax at a rate of 15.5% for foreign cash and certain other net current assets, and 8% on the remaining income. the tcja reduced the u.s. federal statutory tax rate from 35% to 21% effective january 1, 2018. in addition, the tcja subjected us to a tax on our gilti effective july 1, 2018. under gaap, we can make an accounting policy election to either treat taxes due on the gilti inclusion as a current period expense or factor such amounts into our measurement of deferred taxes. we elected the deferred method, under which we recorded the corresponding deferred tax assets and liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. during fiscal year 2018, we recorded a net charge of $13.7 billion related to the enactment of the tcja, due to the impact of the one-time transition tax on the deemed repatriation of deferred foreign income of $17.9 billion, offset in part by the impact of changes in the tax rate of $4.2 billion, primarily on deferred tax assets and liabilities. during the second quarter of fiscal year 2019, we recorded additional tax expense of $157 million, which related to completing our provisional accounting for gilti deferred taxes pursuant to securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin no. 118.   in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2019, in response to the tcja and recently issued regulations, we transferred certain intangible properties held by our foreign subsidiaries to the u.s. and ireland. the transfers of intangible properties resulted in a $2.6 billion net income tax benefit recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2019, as the value of future tax deductions exceeded the current tax liability from foreign jurisdictions and u.s. gilti tax.  78part ii item 8 \u00a0 provision for income taxes\u00a0\u00a0 the components of the provision for income taxes were as follows:  \u00a0   \u00a0 u.s. and foreign components of income before income taxes were as follows:  \u00a0   \u00a0 effective tax rate the items accounting for the difference between income taxes computed at the u.s. federal statutory rate and our effective rate were as follows:  \u00a0   \u00a0 79part ii item 8 \u00a0 the decrease from the federal statutory rate in fiscal year 2019 is primarily due to a $2.6 billion net income tax benefit related to intangible property transfers, and earnings taxed at lower rates in foreign jurisdictions resulting from producing and distributing our products and services through our foreign regional operations centers in ireland, singapore, and puerto rico. the increase from the federal statutory rate in fiscal year 2018 is primarily due to the net charge related to the enactment of the tcja in the second quarter of fiscal year 2018, offset in part by earnings taxed at lower rates in foreign jurisdictions. the decrease from the federal statutory rate in fiscal year 2017 is primarily due to earnings taxed at lower rates in foreign jurisdictions. our foreign regional operating centers in ireland, singapore and puerto rico, which are taxed at rates lower than the u.s. rate, generated 82%, 87%, and 76% of our foreign income before tax in fiscal years 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively. other reconciling items, net consists primarily of tax credits, gilti, and u.s. state income taxes. in fiscal years 2019, 2018, and 2017, there were no individually significant other reconciling items. the decrease in our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2019 compared to fiscal year 2018 was primarily due to the net charge related to the enactment of the tcja in the second quarter of fiscal year 2018, and a $2.6 billion net income tax benefit in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2019 related to intangible property transfers. the increase in our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2018 compared to fiscal year 2017 was primarily due to the net charge related to the enactment of the tcja and the realization of tax benefits attributable to previous phone business losses in fiscal year 2017.  the components of the deferred income tax assets and liabilities were as follows: \u00a0 \u00a0   deferred income tax balances reflect the effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases and are stated at enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when the taxes are paid or recovered.  80part ii item 8 \u00a0 as of june 30, 2019, we had federal, state and foreign net operating loss carryforwards of $978 million, $770 million, and $11.6 billion, respectively. the federal and state net operating loss carryforwards will expire in various years from fiscal 2020 through 2039, if not utilized. the majority of our foreign net operating loss carryforwards do not expire. certain acquired net operating loss carryforwards are subject to an annual limitation, but are expected to be realized with the exception of those which have a valuation allowance. the valuation allowance disclosed in the table above relates to the foreign net operating loss carryforwards and other net deferred tax assets that may not be realized.   income taxes paid, net of refunds, were $8.4 billion, $5.5 billion, and $2.4 billion in fiscal years 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively.  uncertain tax positions gross unrecognized tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions as of june 30, 2019, 2018, and 2017, were $13.1 billion, $12.0 billion, and $11.7 billion, respectively, which were primarily included in long-term income taxes in our consolidated balance sheets. if recognized, the resulting tax benefit would affect our effective tax rates for fiscal years 2019, 2018, and 2017 by $12.0 billion, $11.3 billion, and $10.2 billion, respectively. as of june 30, 2019, 2018, and 2017, we had accrued interest expense related to uncertain tax positions of $3.4 billion, $3.0 billion, and $2.3 billion, respectively, net of income tax benefits. the provision for (benefit from) income taxes for fiscal years 2019, 2018, and 2017 included interest expense related to uncertain tax positions of $515 million, $688 million, and $399 million, respectively, net of income tax benefits. the aggregate changes in the gross unrecognized tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions were as follows: \u00a0   \u00a0 we settled a portion of the internal revenue service (\u201cirs\u201d) audit for tax years 2004 to 2006 in fiscal year 2011. in february 2012, the irs withdrew its 2011 revenue agents report related to unresolved issues for tax years 2004 to 2006 and reopened the audit phase of the examination. we also settled a portion of the irs audit for tax years 2007 to 2009 in fiscal year 2016, and a portion of the irs audit for tax years 2010 to 2013 in fiscal year 2018. we remain under audit for tax years 2004 to 2013. we expect the irs to begin an examination of tax years 2014 to 2017 within the next 12 months. as of june 30, 2019, the primary unresolved issues for the irs audits relate to transfer pricing, which could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements when the matters are resolved. we believe our allowances for income tax contingencies are adequate. we have not received a proposed assessment for the unresolved issues and do not expect a final resolution of these issues in the next 12 months.\u00a0based on the information currently available, we do not anticipate a significant increase or decrease to our tax contingencies for these issues within the next 12 months. we are subject to income tax in many jurisdictions outside the u.s. our operations in certain jurisdictions remain subject to examination for tax years 1996 to 2018, some of which are currently under audit by local tax authorities. the resolution of each of these audits is not expected to be material to our consolidated financial statements. \u00a0 note 13 \u2014 restructuring charges  in june 2017, management approved a sales and marketing restructuring plan. in fiscal year 2017, we recorded employee severance expenses of $306 million primarily related to this sales and marketing restructuring plan. the actions associated with this restructuring plan were completed as of june 30, 2018. 81part ii item 8 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 note 14 \u2014 unearned revenue  unearned revenue by segment was as follows:  \u00a0   \u00a0 changes in unearned revenue were as follows: \u00a0   \u00a0 revenue allocated to remaining performance obligations represents contracted revenue that has not yet been recognized (\u201ccontracted not recognized revenue\u201d), which includes unearned revenue and amounts that will be invoiced and recognized as revenue in future periods. contracted not recognized revenue was $91 billion as of june 30, 2019, of which we expect to recognize approximately 50% of the revenue over the next 12 months and the remainder thereafter. many customers are committing to our products and services for longer contract terms, which is increasing the percentage of contracted revenue that will be recognized beyond the next 12 months. note 15\u00a0\u2014\u00a0leases  we have operating and finance leases for datacenters, corporate offices, research and development facilities, retail stores, and certain equipment. our leases have remaining lease terms of 1 year to 20 years, some of which include options to extend the leases for up to 5 years, and some of which include options to terminate the leases within 1 year.  the components of lease expense were as follows: \u00a0   \u00a0 \u00a0 82part ii item 8 \u00a0 supplemental cash flow information related to leases was as follows: \u00a0   \u00a0 supplemental balance sheet information related to leases was as follows: \u00a0   \u00a0 maturities of lease liabilities were as follows: \u00a0   \u00a0 83part ii item 8 \u00a0 as of june 30, 2019, we have additional operating and finance leases, primarily for datacenters, that have not yet commenced of $2.3 billion and $6.1 billion, respectively. these operating and finance leases will commence between fiscal year 2020 and fiscal year 2022 with lease terms of 1 year to 15 years. note 16 \u2014 contingencies patent and intellectual property claims  there were 44 patent infringement cases pending against microsoft as of june 30, 2019, none of which are material individually or in aggregate.  antitrust, unfair competition, and overcharge class actions  antitrust and unfair competition class action lawsuits were filed against us in british columbia, ontario, and quebec, canada. all three have been certified on behalf of canadian indirect purchasers who acquired licenses for microsoft operating system software and/or productivity application software between 1998 and 2010.  the trial of the british columbia action commenced in may 2016. following a mediation, the parties agreed to a global settlement of all three canadian actions, and submitted the proposed settlement agreement to the courts in all three jurisdictions for approval. the final settlement has been approved by the courts in british columbia, ontario, and quebec, and the claims administration process will commence.  other antitrust litigation and claims  china state administration for industry and commerce investigation  in 2014, microsoft was informed that china\u2019s state agency for market regulation (\u201csamr\u201d) (formerly state administration for industry and commerce) had begun a formal investigation relating to china\u2019s anti-monopoly law, and the samr conducted onsite inspections of microsoft offices in beijing, shanghai, guangzhou, and chengdu. the samr has presented its preliminary views as to certain possible violations of china's anti-monopoly law, and discussions are expected to continue. product-related litigation   u.s. cell phone litigation  microsoft mobile oy, a subsidiary of microsoft, along with other handset manufacturers and network operators, is a defendant in 40 lawsuits filed in the superior court for the district of columbia by individual plaintiffs who allege that radio emissions from cellular handsets caused their brain tumors and other adverse health effects. we assumed responsibility for these claims in our agreement to acquire nokia\u2019s devices and services business and have been substituted for the nokia defendants. nine of these cases were filed in 2002 and are consolidated for certain pre-trial proceedings; the remaining cases are stayed. in a separate 2009 decision, the court of appeals for the district of columbia held that adverse health effect claims arising from the use of cellular handsets that operate within the u.s. federal communications commission radio frequency emission guidelines (\u201cfcc guidelines\u201d) are pre-empted by federal law. the plaintiffs allege that their handsets either operated outside the fcc guidelines or were manufactured before the fcc guidelines went into effect. the lawsuits also allege an industry-wide conspiracy to manipulate the science and testing around emission guidelines.  in 2013, the defendants in the consolidated cases moved to exclude the plaintiffs\u2019 expert evidence of general causation on the basis of flawed scientific methodologies. in 2014, the trial court granted in part and denied in part the defendants\u2019 motion to exclude the plaintiffs\u2019 general causation experts. the defendants filed an interlocutory appeal to the district of columbia court of appeals challenging the standard for evaluating expert scientific evidence. in october 2016, the court of appeals issued its decision adopting the standard advocated by the defendants and remanding the cases to the trial court for further proceedings under that standard. the plaintiffs have filed supplemental expert evidence, portions of which the defendants have moved to strike. in august 2018, the trial court issued an order striking portions of the plaintiffs\u2019 expert reports. a hearing is expected to be scheduled in the second half of calendar year 2019. 84part ii item 8 \u00a0 employment-related litigation moussouris v. microsoft current and former female microsoft employees in certain engineering and information technology roles brought this class action in federal court in seattle in 2015, alleging systemic gender discrimination in pay and promotions. the plaintiffs moved to certify the class in october 2017. microsoft filed an opposition in january 2018, attaching an expert report showing no statistically significant disparity in pay and promotions between similarly situated men and women. in june 2018, the court denied the plaintiffs\u2019 motion for class certification. plaintiffs sought an interlocutory appeal to the u.s. court of appeals for the ninth circuit, which was granted in september 2018. oral argument is scheduled for october 2019.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 other contingencies  we also are subject to a variety of other claims and suits that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of our business. although management currently believes that resolving claims against us, individually or in aggregate, will not have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements, these matters are subject to inherent uncertainties and management\u2019s view of these matters may change in the future.  as of june 30, 2019, we accrued aggregate legal liabilities of $386 million. while we intend to defend these matters vigorously, adverse outcomes that we estimate could reach approximately $1.0 billion in aggregate beyond recorded amounts are reasonably possible. were unfavorable final outcomes to occur, there exists the possibility of a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements for the period in which the effects become reasonably estimable.  note 17\u00a0\u2014\u00a0stockholders\u2019 equity  shares outstanding  shares of common stock outstanding were as follows:  \u00a0   share repurchases  on september\u00a016, 2013, our board of directors approved a share repurchase program (\u201c2013 share repurchase program\u201d) authorizing up to $40.0 billion in share repurchases. the 2013 share

repurchase program, has no expiration date, and may be suspended or discontinued at any time without notice. as of june 30, 2019, $11.4 billion remained of the 2016 share repurchase program. 85part ii item 8 \u00a0 we repurchased the following shares of common stock under the share repurchase programs: \u00a0   \u00a0 shares repurchased in the first and second quarter of fiscal year 2017 were under the 2013 share repurchase program. all other shares repurchased were under the 2016 share repurchase program. the above table excludes shares repurchased to settle employee tax withholding related to the vesting of stock awards of $2.7 billion, $2.1 billion, and $1.5 billion for fiscal years 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively. all share repurchases were made using cash resources. dividends  our

stock plans stock awards entitle the holder to receive shares of microsoft common stock as the award vests. stock awards generally vest over a four or five-year service period.  executive incentive plan  under the executive incentive plan, the compensation committee approves stock awards to executive officers and certain senior executives. rsus generally vest ratably over a four-year service period. psus generally vest over a three-year performance period. the number of shares the psu holder receives is based on the extent to which the corresponding performance goals have been achieved. activity for all stock plans  the fair value of stock awards was estimated on the date of grant using the following assumptions:  \u00a0   during fiscal year 2019, the following activity occurred under our stock plans:  \u00a0   \u00a0   as of june 30, 2019, there was approximately $8.6 billion of total unrecognized compensation costs related to stock awards. these costs are expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 3 years. the weighted average grant-date fair value of stock awards granted was $107.02, $75.88, and $55.64 for fiscal years 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively. the fair value of stock awards vested was $8.7 billion, $6.6 billion, and $4.8 billion, for fiscal years 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively.  employee stock purchase plan  we have an espp for all eligible employees. shares of our common stock may be purchased by employees at three-month intervals at 90% of the fair market value on the last trading day of each three-month period. employees may purchase shares having a value not exceeding 15% of their gross compensation during an offering period. employees purchased the following shares during the periods presented:  \u00a0   \u00a0 as of june 30, 2019, 105\u00a0million shares of our common stock were reserved for future issuance through the espp.  88part ii item 8 \u00a0 savings plan  we have savings plans in the u.s. that qualify under section\u00a0401(k) of the internal revenue code, and a number of savings plans in international locations. eligible u.s. employees may contribute a portion of their salary into the savings plans, subject to certain limitations. we contribute fifty cents for each dollar a participant contributes into the plans, with a maximum employer contribution of 50% of the irs contribution limit for the calendar year. employer-funded retirement benefits for all plans were $877 million, $807 million, and $734 million in fiscal years 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively, and were expensed as contributed.  note 20\u00a0\u2014\u00a0segment information and geographic data  in its operation of the business, management, including our chief operating decision maker, who is also our chief executive officer, reviews certain financial information, including segmented internal profit and loss statements prepared on a basis not consistent with gaap. during the periods presented, we reported our financial performance based on the following segments: productivity and business processes, intelligent cloud, and more personal computing.  our reportable segments are described below.  productivity and business processes  our productivity and business processes segment consists of products and services in our portfolio of productivity, communication, and information services, spanning a variety of devices and platforms. this segment primarily comprises:          intelligent cloud  our intelligent cloud segment consists of our public, private, and hybrid server products and cloud services that can power modern business. this segment primarily comprises:      more personal computing  our more personal computing segment consists of products and services geared towards harmonizing the interests of end users, developers, and it professionals across all devices. this segment primarily comprises:          89part ii item 8 \u00a0 revenue and costs are generally directly attributed to our segments. however, due to the integrated structure of our business, certain revenue recognized and costs incurred by one segment may benefit other segments. revenue from certain contracts is allocated among the segments based on the relative value of the underlying products and services, which can include allocation based on actual prices charged, prices when sold separately, or estimated costs plus a profit margin. cost of revenue is allocated in certain cases based on a relative revenue methodology. operating expenses that are allocated primarily include those relating to marketing of products and services from which multiple segments benefit and are generally allocated based on relative gross margin.  in addition, certain costs incurred at a corporate level that are identifiable and that benefit our segments are allocated to them. these allocated costs include costs of: legal, including settlements and fines; information technology; human resources; finance; excise taxes; field selling; shared facilities services; and customer service and support. each allocation is measured differently based on the specific facts and circumstances of the costs being allocated. certain corporate-level activity is not allocated to our segments, including restructuring expenses.  segment revenue and operating income were as follows during the periods presented:  \u00a0   \u00a0 corporate and other operating loss comprised restructuring expenses.  \u00a0 no sales to an individual customer or country other than the united states accounted for more than 10% of

amounts are primarily included in office products and cloud services, server products and cloud services, and linkedin in the table above. assets are not allocated to segments for internal reporting presentations. a portion of amortization and depreciation is included with various other costs in an overhead allocation to each segment; it is impracticable for us to separately identify the amount of amortization and depreciation by segment that is included in the measure of segment profit or loss.  long-lived assets, excluding financial instruments and tax assets, classified by the location of the controlling statutory company and with countries over 10% of the total shown separately, were as follows:  \u00a0   \u00a0 91part ii item 8 \u00a0 report of independent registered public accounting firm  to the stockholders and the board of directors of microsoft corporation opinion on the financial statements we have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of microsoft

u.s. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the securities and exchange commission and the pcaob.  we conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the pcaob. those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. we believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. critical audit matters \u00a0 the critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the company\u2019s audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. the communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. 93part ii item 8 \u00a0 revenue recognition \u2014 refer to note 1 to the financial statements critical audit matter description the company recognizes revenue upon transfer of control of promised products or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration the company expects to receive in exchange for those products or services. the company offers customers the ability to acquire multiple licenses of software products and services, including cloud-based services, in its customer agreements through its volume licensing programs. significant judgment is exercised by the company in determining revenue recognition for these customer agreements, and includes the following:         given these factors, the related audit effort in evaluating management\u2019s judgments in determining revenue recognition for these customer agreements

audit matter description  the company\u2019s long-term income taxes liability includes uncertain tax positions related to transfer pricing issues that remain unresolved with the internal revenue service (\u201cirs\u201d). the company remains under irs audit, or subject to irs audit, for tax years subsequent to 2003. while the company has settled a portion of the irs audits, resolution of the remaining matters could have a material impact on the company\u2019s financial statements.  conclusions on recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions involve significant estimates and management judgment and include complex considerations of the internal revenue code, related regulations, tax case laws, and prior-year audit settlements. given the complexity and the subjective nature of the transfer pricing issues that remain unresolved with the irs, evaluating management\u2019s estimates relating to their determination of uncertain tax positions required extensive audit effort and a high degree of auditor judgment, including involvement of our tax specialists. how the critical audit matter was addressed in the audit our principal audit procedures to evaluate management\u2019s estimates of uncertain tax positions related to unresolved transfer pricing issues included the following:           /s/\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0deloitte\u00a0& touche llp  seattle,

financial reporting a company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. a company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. /s/\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0deloitte\u00a0& touche llp  seattle, washington  august 1, 2019

and/or increased operating costs, such as for research and development, marketing, and sales incentives. this may lead to lower revenue, gross margins, and operating income.  our increasing focus on services presents execution and competitive risks.\u00a0a growing part of our business involves cloud-based services available across the spectrum of computing devices. our strategic vision is to compete and grow by building best-in-class platforms and productivity services for an intelligent cloud and an intelligent edge infused with ai. at the same time, our competitors are rapidly developing and deploying cloud-based services for consumers and business customers. pricing and delivery models are evolving. devices and form factors influence how users access services in the cloud and sometimes the user\u2019s choice of which suite of cloud-based services to use. we are devoting significant resources to develop and deploy our cloud-based strategies. the windows ecosystem must continue to evolve with this changing environment. we are undertaking cultural and organizational changes to drive accountability and eliminate obstacles to innovation. the company\u2019s investment in gaining insights from data is becoming central to the value of the services we deliver to customers, to our operational efficiency and key opportunities in monetization, customer perceptions of quality, and operational efficiency. our ability to use data in this way may be constrained by regulatory developments that impede realizing the expected return from this investment. besides software development costs, we are incurring costs to build and maintain infrastructure to support cloud computing services. these costs will reduce the operating margins we have previously achieved. whether we succeed in cloud-based services depends on our execution in several areas, including:            it is uncertain whether our strategies will attract the users or generate the revenue required to succeed. if we are not effective in executing organizational and technical changes to increase efficiency and accelerate innovation, or if we fail to generate sufficient usage of our new products and services, we may not grow revenue in line with the infrastructure and development investments described above. this may negatively impact gross margins and operating income.  we make significant investments in new products and services that may not achieve expected returns.\u00a0we will continue to make significant investments in research, development, and marketing for existing products, services, and technologies, including the windows operating system, the microsoft office system, bing, windows server, the windows store, the microsoft azure services platform, office 365, other cloud-based offerings, and the xbox entertainment platform. we also invest in the development and acquisition of a variety of hardware for productivity, communication, and entertainment including pcs, tablets, gaming devices, and hololens. investments in new technology are speculative. commercial success depends on many factors, including innovativeness, developer support, and effective distribution and marketing. if customers do not perceive our latest offerings as providing significant new functionality or other value, they may reduce their purchases of new software and hardware products or upgrades, unfavorably affecting revenue. we may not achieve significant revenue from new product, service, and  18part i item 1a \u00a0 distribution channel investments for several years, if at all. new products and services may not be profitable, and even if they are profitable, operating margins for some new products and businesses will not be as high as the margins we have experienced historically.  we did extensive preparation and ongoing compatibility testing for applications and devices to help ensure a positive experience for our users installing windows 10. however, negative upgrade experiences could adversely affect the reception of windows\u00a010 in the marketplace and could lead to litigation or regulatory actions by customers and government agencies.\u00a0in addition, we anticipate that windows\u00a010 will enable new post-license monetization opportunities beyond initial license revenues.\u00a0our inability to realize these opportunities to the extent we expect could have an adverse impact on our revenues. finally, our practices for data collection, use, and management in windows 10 are subject to regulatory review, and may result in decisions directing us to change these practices and imposing fines. if so, we could face negative public reaction, degraded user experiences, and reduced flexibility in product design.  developing new technologies is complex. it can require long development and testing periods. significant delays in new releases or significant problems in creating new products or services could adversely affect our revenue.  acquisitions, joint ventures, and strategic alliances may have an adverse effect on our business.\u00a0we expect to continue making acquisitions and entering into joint ventures and strategic alliances as part of our long-term business strategy. in december 2016, we completed our acquisition of linkedin for $27.0 billion. the linkedin acquisition and other transactions and arrangements involve significant challenges and risks, including that they do not advance our business strategy, that we get an unsatisfactory return on our investment, that we have difficulty integrating and retaining new employees, business systems, and technology, or that they distract management from our other businesses. if an arrangement fails to adequately anticipate changing circumstances and interests of a party, it may result in early termination or renegotiation of the arrangement. the success of these transactions and arrangements will depend in part on our ability to leverage them to enhance our existing products and services or develop compelling new ones. it may take longer than expected to realize the full benefits from these transactions and arrangements, such as increased revenue, enhanced efficiencies, or increased market share, or the benefits may ultimately be smaller than we expected. these events could adversely affect our operating results or financial condition.  if our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets become impaired, we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings.\u00a0we acquire other companies and intangible assets and may not realize all the economic benefit from those acquisitions, which could cause an impairment of goodwill or intangibles. we review our amortizable intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. we test goodwill for impairment at least annually. factors that may be a change in circumstances, indicating that the carrying value of our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets may not be recoverable, include a decline in our stock price and market capitalization, reduced future cash flow estimates, and slower growth rates in industry segments in which we participate. we may be required to record a significant charge on our consolidated financial statements during the period in which any impairment of our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets is determined, negatively affecting our results of operations. for example, in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2015, we recorded a $5.1 billion charge for the impairment of goodwill and a $2.2 billion charge for the impairment of intangible assets, and in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016 we recorded a $480 million charge for the impairment of intangible assets. the impairment charges for both periods related to our phone business. our acquisition of linkedin resulted in a significant increase in our goodwill and intangible asset balances.  we may not earn the revenues we expect from our intellectual property rights.  we may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property rights  protecting our intellectual property rights and combating unlicensed copying and use of our software and other intellectual property on a global basis is difficult. while piracy adversely affects u.s. revenue, the impact on revenue from outside the u.s. is more significant, particularly in countries where laws are less protective of intellectual property rights. our revenue in these markets may grow slower than the underlying device market. similarly, the absence of harmonized patent laws makes it more difficult to ensure consistent respect for patent rights. throughout the world, we educate users about the benefits of licensing genuine products and obtaining indemnification benefits for intellectual property risks, and we educate lawmakers about the advantages of a business climate where intellectual property rights are protected. reductions in the legal protection for software intellectual property rights could adversely affect revenue.  19part i item 1a \u00a0 we may not receive expected royalties from our patent licenses  we expend significant resources to patent the intellectual property we create with the expectation that we will generate revenues by incorporating that intellectual property in our products or services or, in some instances, by licensing our patents to others in return for a royalty.\u00a0changes in the law may weaken our ability to prevent the use of patented technology or collect revenue for licensing our patents.\u00a0these include legislative changes and regulatory actions that make it more difficult to obtain injunctions, and the increasing use of legal process to challenge issued patents. similarly, licensees of our patents may fail to satisfy their obligations to pay us royalties, or may contest the scope and extent of their obligations. finally, the royalties we can obtain to monetize our intellectual property may decline because of the evolution of technology, selling price changes in products using licensed patents, or the difficulty of discovering infringements. third parties may claim we infringe their intellectual property rights.\u00a0from time to time, others claim we infringe their intellectual property rights. the number of these claims may grow because of constant technological change in the markets in which we compete, the extensive patent coverage of existing technologies, the rapid rate of issuance of new patents, and our offering of first-party devices, such as surface and lumia phones. to resolve these claims, we may enter into royalty and licensing agreements on terms that are less favorable than currently available, stop selling or redesign affected products or services, or pay damages to satisfy indemnification commitments with our customers. these outcomes may cause operating margins to decline. besides money damages, in some jurisdictions plaintiffs can seek injunctive relief that may limit or prevent importing, marketing, and selling our products or services that have infringing technologies. in some countries, such as germany, an injunction can be issued before the parties have fully litigated the validity of the underlying patents. we have paid significant amounts to settle claims related to the use of technology and intellectual property rights and to procure intellectual property rights as part of our strategy to manage this risk, and may continue to do so.  we may not be able to protect our source code from copying if there is an unauthorized disclosure of source code.\u00a0source code, the detailed program commands for our operating systems and other software programs, is critical to our business. although we license portions of our application and operating system source code to several licensees, we take significant measures to protect the secrecy of large portions of our source code. if a significant portion of our source code leaks, we might lose future trade secret protection for that source code. it may become easier for third parties to compete with our products by copying functionality, which could adversely affect our revenue and operating margins. unauthorized disclosure of source code also could increase the security risks described in the next paragraph.  cyber-attacks and security vulnerabilities could lead to reduced revenue, increased costs, liability claims, or harm to our competitive position.  security of microsoft\u2019s information technology  threats to it security can take a variety of forms. individual and groups of hackers and sophisticated organizations, including state-sponsored organizations or nation-states, continuously undertake attacks that pose threats to our customers and our it.\u00a0these actors may use a wide variety of methods, which may include developing and deploying malicious software to attack our products and services and gain access to our networks and datacenters, using social engineering techniques to induce our employees, users, partners, or customers to disclose passwords or other sensitive information or take other actions to gain access to our data or our users\u2019 or customers\u2019 data, or acting in a coordinated manner to launch distributed denial of service or other coordinated attacks. cyber threats are constantly evolving, increasing the difficulty of detecting and successfully defending against them. cyber threats can have cascading impacts that unfold with increasing speed across our internal networks and systems and those of our partners and customers. breaches of our network or data security could disrupt the security of our internal systems and business applications, impair our ability to provide services to our customers and protect the privacy of their data, result in product development delays, compromise confidential or technical business information harming our reputation or competitive position, result in theft or misuse of our intellectual property or other assets, require us to allocate more resources to improved technologies, or otherwise adversely affect our business.  in addition, our internal it environment continues to evolve. often, we are early adopters of new devices and technologies. we embrace new ways of sharing data and communicating internally and with partners and customers using methods such as social networking and other consumer-oriented technologies. our business policies and internal security controls may not keep pace with these changes as new threats emerge.  20part i item 1a \u00a0 security of our products, services, devices, and customers\u2019 data  the security of our products and services is important in our customers\u2019 decisions to purchase or use our products or services. security threats are a challenge to companies like us whose business is technology products and services. threats to our own it infrastructure can also affect our customers. customers using our cloud-based services rely on the security of our infrastructure to ensure the reliability of our services and the protection of their data. hackers tend to focus their efforts on the most popular operating systems, programs, and services, including many of ours, and we expect that to continue. hackers that acquire user account information at other companies can use that information to compromise our users\u2019 accounts where accounts share the same attributes like passwords.  to defend against security threats, both to our internal it systems and those of our customers, we must continuously engineer more secure products and services, enhance security and reliability features, improve the deployment of software updates to address security vulnerabilities, develop mitigation technologies that help to secure customers from attacks even when software updates are not deployed, maintain the digital security infrastructure that protects the integrity of our network, products, and services, and provide customers security tools such as firewalls and anti-virus software.  the cost of these steps could reduce our operating margins. if we fail to do these things well, actual or perceived security vulnerabilities in our products and services could harm our reputation and lead customers to reduce or delay future purchases of products or subscriptions to services, or to use competing products or services. customers may also spend more on protecting their existing computer systems from attack, which could delay adoption of additional products or services. customers may fail to update their systems, continue to run software or operating systems we no longer support, or may fail timely to install security patches. any of these actions by customers could adversely affect our revenue. actual or perceived vulnerabilities may lead to claims against us. although our license agreements typically contain provisions that eliminate or limit our exposure to liability, there is no assurance these provisions will withstand legal challenges. legislative or regulatory action in these areas may increase the costs to develop, implement, or secure our products and services.  disclosure of personal data could result in liability and harm our reputation.\u00a0as we continue to grow the number and scale of our cloud-based offerings, we store and process increasingly large amounts of personally identifiable information of our customers. the continued occurrence of high-profile data breaches provides evidence of an external environment increasingly hostile to information security. despite our efforts to improve the security controls across our business groups and geographies, it is possible our security controls over personal data, our training of employees and vendors on data security, and other practices we follow may not prevent the improper disclosure of customer data we or our vendors store and manage. improper disclosure could harm our reputation, lead to legal exposure to customers, or subject us to liability under laws that protect personal data, resulting in increased costs or loss of revenue. our software products and services also enable our customers to store and process personal data on-premises or, increasingly, in a cloud-based environment we host. government authorities can sometimes require us to produce customer data in response to valid legal orders. in the u.s. and elsewhere, we advocate for transparency concerning these requests and appropriate limitations on government authority to compel disclosure. despite our efforts to protect customer data, perceptions that the collection, use, and retention of personal information is not satisfactorily protected could inhibit sales of our products or services, and could limit adoption of our cloud-based solutions by consumers, businesses, and government entities. additional security measures we may take to address customer concerns, or constraints on our flexibility to determine where and how to operate datacenters in response to customer expectations or governmental rules or actions, may cause higher operating expenses.  we may have outages, data losses, and disruptions of our online services if we fail to maintain an adequate operations infrastructure.\u00a0our increasing user traffic, growth in services, and the complexity of our products and services demand more computing power. we spend substantial amounts to build, purchase, or lease datacenters and equipment and to upgrade our technology and network infrastructure to handle more traffic on our websites and in our datacenters. these demands continue to increase as we introduce new products and services and support the growth of existing services such as bing, exchange online, microsoft azure, microsoft account services, office 365, onedrive, sharepoint online, skype, xbox live, outlook.com, and windows stores. we are rapidly growing our business of providing a platform and back-end hosting for services provided by third parties to their end users. maintaining, securing, and expanding this infrastructure is expensive and complex. it requires that we maintain an internet connectivity infrastructure that is robust and reliable within competitive and regulatory constraints that continue to evolve. inefficiencies or operational failures, including temporary or permanent loss of customer data or insufficient internet connectivity, could diminish the quality of our products, services, and user experience resulting in contractual liability, claims by customers and other third parties, regulatory actions, damage to our reputation, and loss of current and potential users, subscribers, and advertisers, each of which may harm our operating results and financial condition.  21part i item 1a \u00a0 government litigation and regulatory activity relating to competition rules may limit how we design and market our products.\u00a0as a leading global software and device maker, government agencies closely scrutinize us under u.s. and foreign competition laws. an increasing number of governments are regulating competition law activities and this includes increased scrutiny in potentially large markets such as the european union (\u201ceu\u201d), the u.s., and china. some jurisdictions also allow competitors or consumers to assert claims of anti-competitive conduct. u.s. federal and state antitrust authorities have previously brought enforcement actions and continue to scrutinize our business.  the european commission (\u201cthe commission\u201d) closely scrutinizes the design of high-volume microsoft products and the terms on which we make certain technologies used in these products, such as file formats, programming interfaces, and protocols, available to other companies. flagship product releases such as windows 10 can receive significant scrutiny under competition laws. for example, in 2004, the commission ordered us to create new versions of our windows operating system that do not include certain multimedia technologies and to provide our competitors with specifications for how to implement certain proprietary windows communications protocols in their own products. in 2009, the commission accepted a set of commitments offered by microsoft to address the commission\u2019s concerns relating to competition in web browsing software, including an undertaking to address commission concerns relating to interoperability. the web browsing commitments expired in 2014. the remaining obligations may limit our ability to innovate in windows or other products in the future, diminish the developer appeal of the windows platform, and increase our product development costs. the availability of licenses related to protocols and file formats may enable competitors to develop software products that better mimic the functionality of our products, which could hamper sales of our\u00a0products.  our portfolio of first-party devices continues to grow; at the same time our oem partners offer a large variety of devices on our platforms. as a result, increasingly we both cooperate and compete with our oem partners, creating a risk that we fail to do so in compliance with competition rules. regulatory scrutiny in this area may increase. certain foreign governments, particularly in china and other countries in asia, have advanced arguments under their competition laws that exert downward pressure on royalties for our intellectual property. because these jurisdictions only recently implemented competition laws, their enforcement activities are unpredictable.  government regulatory actions and court decisions such as these may hinder our ability to provide the benefits of our software to consumers and businesses, reducing the attractiveness of our products and the revenue that come from them. new competition law actions could be initiated. the outcome of such actions, or steps taken to avoid them, could adversely affect us in a variety of ways, including:            our global operations subject us to potential liability under anti-corruption, trade protection, and other laws and regulations.\u00a0the foreign corrupt practices act and other anti-corruption laws and regulations (\u201canti-corruption laws\u201d) prohibit corrupt payments by our employees, vendors, or agents. from time to time, we receive inquiries from authorities in the u.s. and elsewhere and reports from employees and others about our business activities outside the u.s. and our compliance with anti-corruption laws. specifically, we have been cooperating with authorities in the u.s. in connection with reports concerning our compliance with the foreign corrupt practices act in various countries. while we devote substantial resources to our global compliance programs and have implemented policies, training, and internal controls designed to reduce the risk of corrupt payments, our employees, vendors, or agents may violate our policies. our failure to comply with anti-corruption laws could result in significant fines and penalties, criminal sanctions against us, our officers, or our employees, prohibitions on the conduct of our business, and damage to our reputation. operations outside the u.s. may be affected by changes in trade protection laws, policies, and measures, sanctions, and other regulatory requirements affecting trade and investment. we may be subject to legal liability and reputational damage if we sell goods or services in violation of u.s. trade sanctions on countries such as iran, north korea, cuba, sudan, and syria.  22part i item 1a \u00a0 other regulatory areas that may apply to our products and online services offerings include user privacy, telecommunications, data storage and protection, and online content. for example, regulators may take the position that our offerings such as skype are covered by laws regulating telecommunications services. data protection authorities may assert that our collection, use, and management of customer data is inconsistent with their laws and regulations. applying these laws and regulations to our business is often unclear, subject to change over time, and sometimes may conflict from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. additionally, these laws and governments\u2019 approach to their enforcement, and our products and services, are continuing to evolve. compliance with these types of regulation may involve significant costs or require changes in products or business practices that result in reduced revenue. noncompliance could result in the imposition of penalties or orders we stop the alleged noncompliant activity.  laws and regulations relating to the handling of personal data may impede the adoption of our services or result in increased costs, legal claims, or fines against us.\u00a0the growth of our internet- and cloud-based services internationally relies increasingly on the movement of data across national boundaries. legal requirements relating to the collection, storage, handling, and transfer of personal data continue to evolve. for example, the eu and the u.s. formally entered into a new framework in july 2016 that provides a mechanism for companies to transfer data from eu member states to the u.s. this new framework, called the privacy shield, is intended to address shortcomings identified by the european court of justice in a predecessor mechanism. the privacy shield and other mechanisms are subject to review by the european courts, which may lead to uncertainty about the legal basis for data transfers across the atlantic. in 2016, the eu adopted a new law governing data practices and privacy called the general data protection regulation (\u201cgdpr\u201d), which becomes effective in may\u00a02018.\u00a0the law requires firms to meet new requirements regarding the handling of personal data. engineering efforts to build new capabilities to facilitate compliance with the law may entail substantial expense and the diversion of engineering resources from other projects. if we are unable to engineer products that meet microsoft\u2019s legal duties or help our customers meet their obligations under the gdpr or other data regulations, we might experience reduced demand for our offerings. non-compliance with the gdpr may result in monetary penalties of up to 4% of worldwide revenue. ongoing legal reviews by regulators may result in burdensome or inconsistent requirements affecting the location and movement of our customer and internal employee data as well as the management of that data. compliance may require changes in services, business practices, or internal systems that result in increased costs, lower revenue, reduced efficiency, or greater difficulty in competing with foreign-based firms. failure to comply with existing or new rules may result in significant penalties or orders to stop the alleged noncompliant activity.  our business depends on our ability to attract and retain talented employees.\u00a0our business is based on successfully attracting and retaining talented employees. the market for highly skilled workers and leaders in our industry is extremely competitive. we are limited in our ability to recruit internationally by restrictive domestic immigration laws. changes to u.s. immigration policies that restrain the flow of technical and professional talent may inhibit our ability to adequately staff our research and development efforts. if we are less successful in our recruiting efforts, or if we cannot retain key employees, our ability to develop and deliver successful products and services may be adversely affected. effective succession planning is also important to our long-term success. failure to ensure effective transfer of knowledge and smooth transitions involving key employees could hinder our strategic planning and execution. how employment-related laws are interpreted and applied to our workforce practices may result in increased operating costs and less flexibility in how we meet our workforce needs.  we have claims and lawsuits against us that may result in adverse outcomes.\u00a0we are subject to a variety of claims and lawsuits. these claims may arise from a wide variety of business practices and initiatives, including major new product releases such as windows 10, significant business transactions, warranty or product claims, and employment practices. adverse outcomes in some or all of these claims may result in significant monetary damages or injunctive relief that could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business. the litigation and other claims are subject to inherent uncertainties and management\u2019s view of these matters may change in the future. a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements could occur for the period in which the effect of an unfavorable outcome becomes probable and reasonably estimable.  we may have additional tax liabilities.\u00a0we are subject to income taxes in the u.s. and many foreign jurisdictions. significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes. in the ordinary course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. we regularly are under audit by tax authorities in different jurisdictions. economic\u00a0and political\u00a0pressures to increase tax revenue in various jurisdictions may make resolving tax disputes favorably more difficult. although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation in the jurisdictions where we are subject to taxation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals. the results of an audit or litigation could have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements in the period or periods in which that determination is made.  23part i item 1a \u00a0 we earn a significant amount of our operating income from outside the u.s., and any repatriation of funds currently held in foreign jurisdictions to the u.s. may result in higher effective tax rates for the company. in addition, there have been proposals from congress to change u.s. tax laws that would significantly impact how u.s. multinational corporations are taxed on foreign earnings. although we cannot predict whether or in what form any proposed legislation may pass, if enacted, it could have a material adverse impact on our tax expense and cash flows.  our hardware and software products may experience quality or supply problems.\u00a0our vertically-integrated hardware products such as xbox consoles, surface devices, and other devices we design, manufacture, and market are highly complex and can have defects in design, manufacture, or associated software. we could incur significant expenses, lost revenue, and reputational harm as a result of recalls, safety alerts, or product liability claims if we fail to prevent, detect, or address such issues through design, testing, or warranty repairs. we acquire some device components from sole suppliers. our competitors use some of the same suppliers and their demand for hardware components can affect the capacity available to us. if a component from a sole-source supplier is delayed or becomes unavailable, whether because of supplier capacity constraint or industry shortages, we may not obtain timely replacement supplies, resulting in reduced sales. component shortages, excess or obsolete inventory, or price reductions resulting in inventory adjustments may increase our cost of revenue. xbox consoles, surface devices, and other hardware are assembled in asia and other geographies that may be subject to disruptions in the supply chain, resulting in shortages that would affect our revenue and operating margins. these same risks would apply to any other vertically-integrated hardware and software products we may offer.  our software products also may experience quality or reliability problems. the highly-sophisticated software products we develop may contain bugs and other defects that interfere with their intended operation. any defects we do not detect and fix in pre-release testing could cause reduced sales and revenue, damage to our reputation, repair or remediation costs, delays in the release of new products or versions, or legal liability. although our license agreements typically contain provisions that eliminate or limit our exposure to liability, there is no assurance these provisions will withstand legal challenge.  we strive to empower all people and organizations to achieve more, and accessibility of our products is an important aspect of this goal. there is increasing pressure from advocacy groups, regulators, competitors, and customers to make technology more accessible. if our products do not meet customer expectations or emerging global accessibility requirements, we could lose sales opportunities or face regulatory actions.  our global business exposes us to operational and economic risks.\u00a0our customers are located in over 200 countries and a significant part of our revenue comes from international sales. the global nature of our business creates operational and economic risks. emerging markets are a significant focus of our international growth strategy. the developing nature of these markets presents several risks, including deterioration of social, political, labor, or economic conditions in a country or region, and difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations. although we hedge a portion of our international currency exposure, significant fluctuations in foreign exchange rates between the u.s. dollar and foreign currencies may adversely affect our revenue. competitive or regulatory pressure to make our pricing structure uniform might require that we reduce the sales price of our software in the u.s. and other countries.  catastrophic events or geopolitical conditions may disrupt our business.\u00a0a disruption or failure of our systems or operations because of a major earthquake, weather event, cyber-attack, terrorist attack, or other catastrophic event could cause delays in completing sales, providing services, or performing other critical functions. our corporate headquarters, a significant portion of our research and development activities, and certain other essential business operations are in the seattle, washington area, and we have other business operations in the silicon valley area of california, both of which are seismically active regions. a catastrophic event that results in the destruction or disruption of any of our critical business or it systems could harm our ability to conduct normal business operations. providing our customers with more services and solutions in the cloud puts a premium on the resilience of our systems and strength of our business continuity management plans, and magnifies the potential impact of prolonged service outages on our operating results.  24part i item 1a \u00a0 abrupt political change, terrorist activity, and armed conflict pose a risk of general economic disruption in affected countries, which may increase our operating costs. these conditions also may add uncertainty to the timing and budget for technology investment decisions by our customers, and may cause supply chain disruptions for hardware manufacturers. geopolitical change may result in changing regulatory requirements that could impact our operating strategies, access to global markets, hiring, and profitability. geopolitical instability may lead to sanctions and impact our ability to do business in some markets or with some public-sector customers. emerging nationalist trends in specific countries may significantly alter the trade environment. changes to trade policy or agreements may result in higher tariffs, local sourcing initiatives, or other developments that make it more difficult to sell our products in foreign countries. any of these changes may negatively impact our revenues.  the long-term effects of climate change on the global economy or the it industry in particular are unclear. environmental regulations or changes in the supply, demand or available sources of energy or other natural resources may affect the availability or cost of goods and services, including natural resources, necessary to run our business. changes in weather where we operate may increase the costs of powering and cooling computer hardware we use to develop software and provide cloud-based services.  adverse economic or market conditions may harm our business.\u00a0worsening economic conditions, including inflation, recession, or other changes in economic conditions, may cause lower it spending and adversely affect our revenue. if demand for pcs, servers, and other computing devices declines, or consumer or business spending for those products declines, our revenue will be adversely affected. substantial revenue comes from our u.s. government contracts. an extended federal government shutdown resulting from failing to pass budget appropriations, adopt continuing funding resolutions or raise the debt ceiling, and other budgetary decisions limiting or delaying federal government spending, could reduce government it spending on our products and services and adversely affect our revenue.  our product distribution system relies on an extensive partner and retail network. oems building devices that run our software have also been a significant means of distribution. the impact of economic conditions on our partners, such as the bankruptcy of a major distributor, oem, or retailer, could cause sales channel disruption.  challenging economic conditions also may impair the ability of our customers to pay for products and services they have purchased. as a result, allowances for doubtful accounts and write-offs of accounts receivable may increase.  we maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings, types, and maturities. these investments are subject to general credit, liquidity, market, and interest rate risks, which may be exacerbated by unusual events that affect global financial markets. a significant part of our investment portfolio comprises u.s. government securities. if global credit and equity markets decline for long periods, or if there is a downgrade of the u.s. government credit rating due to an actual or threatened default on government debt, our investment portfolio may be adversely affected and we could determine that more of our investments have experienced an other-than-temporary decline in fair value, requiring impairment charges that could adversely affect our financial results.  changes in our sales organization may impact revenues.\u00a0in july 2017, we announced plans to reorganize our global sales organization to help enable customers\u2019 digital transformation, add greater technical ability to our sales force, and create pooled resources that can be used across countries and industries. the reorganization is the most significant change in our global sales organization in microsoft\u2019s history, involving employees changing roles, adding additional talent, realigning teams, and onboarding new partners. successfully executing these changes will be a significant factor in enabling future revenue growth. as we navigate through this transition, sales, profitability, and cash flow could be adversely impacted. \u00a0 \u00a0 25part ii item 7 \u00a0 in july 2015, we announced a plan to restructure our phone business to better focus and align resources. in may 2016, we announced plans to further streamline our smartphone hardware business.\u00a0\u00a0our change in phone strategy resulted in a reduction in units sold and associated expenses in fiscal year 2016 and 2017.  industry trends  our industry is dynamic and highly competitive, with frequent changes in both technologies and business models. each industry shift is an opportunity to conceive new products, new technologies, or new ideas that can further transform the industry and our business. at microsoft, we push the boundaries of what is possible through a broad range of research and development activities that seek to identify and address the changing demands of customers and users, industry trends, and competitive forces.  economic conditions, challenges, and risks  the markets for software, devices, and cloud-based services are dynamic and highly competitive. our competitors are developing new software and devices, while also deploying competing cloud-based services for consumers and businesses. the devices and form factors customers prefer evolve rapidly, and influence how users access services in the cloud, and in some cases, the user\u2019s choice of which suite of cloud-based services to use. we must continue to evolve and adapt over an extended time in pace with this changing environment. the investments we are making in infrastructure and devices will continue to increase our operating costs and may decrease our operating margins.  our success is highly dependent on our ability to attract and retain qualified employees. we hire a mix of university and industry talent worldwide. microsoft competes for talented individuals globally by offering an exceptional working environment, broad customer reach, scale in resources, the ability to grow one\u2019s career across many different products and businesses, and competitive compensation and benefits. aggregate demand for our software, services, and devices is correlated to global macroeconomic and geopolitical factors, which remain dynamic.  our international operations provide a significant portion of our total revenue and expenses. many of these revenue and expenses are denominated in currencies other than the u.s. dollar. as a result, changes in foreign exchange rates may significantly affect revenue and expenses. the strengthening of the u.s. dollar relative to certain foreign currencies throughout fiscal year 2015, 2016, and 2017, negatively impacted reported revenue and reduced reported expenses from our international operations. see a discussion of these factors and other risks under risk factors (part i, item\u00a01a of this form 10-k).  seasonality  our revenue historically has fluctuated quarterly and has generally been highest in the second quarter of our fiscal year due to corporate calendar year-end spending trends in our major markets and holiday season spending by consumers. reportable segments  we report our financial performance based on the following segments: productivity and business processes, intelligent cloud, and more personal computing. the segment amounts included in md&a are presented on a basis consistent with our internal management reporting. all differences between our internal management reporting basis and accounting principles generally accepted in the united states (\u201cu.s. gaap\u201d), along with certain corporate-level and other activity, are included in corporate and other. we have recast certain previously reported amounts to conform to the way we internally manage and monitor segment performance. additional information on our reportable segments is contained in note 21 \u2013 segment information and geographic data of the notes to financial statements (part ii, item\u00a08 of this form 10-k). 30part ii item 7 \u00a0 summary results of operations \u00a0   fiscal year 2017 compared with fiscal year 2016  revenue increased $4.6 billion or 5%, driven by growth in productivity and business processes and intelligent cloud, offset in part by lower revenue from more personal computing. productivity and business processes revenue increased, driven by the acquisition of linkedin and higher revenue from microsoft office. intelligent cloud revenue increased, primarily due to higher revenue from server products and cloud services. more personal computing revenue decreased, mainly due to lower revenue from devices, offset in part by higher revenue from windows and search advertising. revenue included an unfavorable foreign currency impact of 2%.  gross margin increased $3.1 billion or 6%, due to growth across each of our segments, including the acquisition of linkedin, driven by higher revenue. gross margin included an unfavorable foreign currency impact of 2%. gross margin percentage increased slightly due to a margin percent increase in more personal computing and segment sales mix, offset in part by margin percent declines in productivity and business processes and intelligent cloud. gross margin percentage includes a 5-point improvement in commercial cloud gross margin primarily across azure and office 365. operating income increased $2.1 billion or 11%, primarily due to higher gross margin and lower impairment, integration, and restructuring expenses, offset in part by an increase in research and development and sales and marketing expenses. operating income included an operating loss of $948 million related to the acquisition of linkedin, including $866 million of amortization of intangible assets. operating income also included an unfavorable foreign currency impact of 4%. key changes in expenses were:          diluted earnings per share (\u201ceps\u201d) was $2.71 for fiscal year 2017. current year diluted eps was negatively impacted by the net revenue deferral from windows 10 and restructuring expenses, which resulted in a decrease in diluted eps of $0.60. diluted eps was $2.10 for fiscal year 2016. prior year diluted eps was negatively impacted by the net revenue deferral from windows 10 and impairment and restructuring expenses, which resulted in a decrease in diluted eps of $0.69.\u00a0 fiscal year 2016 compared with fiscal year 2015  revenue decreased $8.3 billion or 9%, primarily due to the impact of the net revenue deferral from windows 10 of $6.6 billion and an unfavorable foreign currency impact of approximately $3.8 billion or 4%. windows 10 revenue is primarily recognized at the time of billing in the more personal computing segment, and the deferral and subsequent recognition of revenue is reflected in corporate and other. more personal computing revenue decreased, mainly due to lower revenue from devices and windows, offset in part by higher revenue from search advertising and gaming. intelligent cloud revenue increased, primarily due to higher revenue from server products and cloud services and enterprise services. productivity and business processes revenue increased slightly, driven by an increase in office and dynamics revenue. 31part ii item 7 \u00a0 operating income increased $2.0 billion or 11%, primarily due to a decrease in impairment, integration, and restructuring expenses and sales and

year 2016 compared with fiscal year 2015  general and administrative expenses decreased $48 million or 1%, primarily due to a reduction in employee-related expenses, offset in part by increased investments in infrastructure supporting our business transformation. expenses included a favorable foreign currency impact of approximately 2%. impairment, integration, and restructuring expenses impairment, integration, and restructuring expenses include costs associated with the impairment of goodwill and intangible assets related to our phone business, employee severance expenses and costs associated with the consolidation of facilities and manufacturing operations related to restructuring activities, and systems consolidation and other business integration expenses associated with our acquisition of nokia corporation\u2019s devices and services business (\u201cnds\u201d). fiscal year 2017 compared with fiscal year 2016  impairment, integration, and restructuring expenses were $306 million for fiscal year 2017, compared to $1.1 billion for fiscal year 2016.  during fiscal year 2017, we recorded $306 million of employee severance expenses primarily related to our sales and marketing restructuring plan.\u00a0\u00a0during fiscal year 2016, we recorded $630 million of asset impairment charges related to our phone business. we also recorded $480 million of restructuring charges, including employee severance expenses and contract termination costs, primarily related to our previously announced phone business restructuring plans.  fiscal year 2016 compared with fiscal year 2015  impairment, integration, and restructuring expenses were $1.1 billion for fiscal year 2016, compared to $10.0 billion for fiscal year 2015.  37part ii item 7 \u00a0 during fiscal year 2015, we recognized impairment charges of $7.5 billion related to our phone business. our annual goodwill impairment test as of may 1, 2015 indicated that the carrying value of our previous phone hardware reporting unit goodwill exceeded its estimated fair value. accordingly, we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $5.1 billion, reducing our phone hardware reporting unit goodwill from $5.4 billion to $116 million, net of foreign currency remeasurements, as well as an impairment charge of $2.2 billion related to the write-down of our phone hardware reporting unit intangible assets. all remaining goodwill and intangible assets are included in our devices reporting unit, within more personal computing under our current segment structure. restructuring charges were $2.1 billion, including employee severance expenses and the write-down of certain assets in connection with our restructuring activities. integration expenses associated with the acquisition of nds were $435 million in fiscal year 2015. other income (expense), net  the components of other income (expense), net were as follows:  \u00a0   we use derivative instruments to: manage risks related to foreign currencies, equity prices, interest rates, and credit; enhance investment returns; and facilitate portfolio diversification. gains and losses from changes in fair values of derivatives that are not designated as hedges are primarily recognized in other income (expense), net. other than those derivatives entered into for investment purposes, such as commodity contracts, the gains (losses) are generally economically offset by unrealized gains (losses) in the underlying available-for-sale securities and gains (losses) on certain balance sheet amounts from foreign exchange rate changes.  fiscal year 2017 compared with fiscal year 2016  dividends and interest income increased primarily due to higher portfolio balances and yields on fixed-income securities. interest expense increased primarily due to higher outstanding long-term debt. net recognized gains on investments increased primarily due to higher gains on sales of equity securities. net losses on derivatives increased due to higher losses on equity derivatives, offset in part by lower losses on commodity and foreign currency derivatives. other, net reflects recognized losses from certain joint ventures and divestitures.  fiscal year 2016 compared with fiscal year 2015  dividends and interest income increased due to higher portfolio balances and slightly higher yields on fixed-income securities. interest expense increased due to higher outstanding long-term debt. net recognized gains on investments decreased primarily due to higher other-than-temporary impairments and lower gains on sales of fixed-income securities, offset in part by higher gains on sales of equity securities. net losses on derivatives increased due to higher losses on currency and equity contracts and lower gains on interest rate contracts in the current period as compared to the prior period, offset in part by lower losses on commodity contracts. for fiscal year 2016, other reflects recognized losses from divestitures and certain joint ventures.  income taxes  fiscal year 2017 compared with fiscal year 2016  our effective tax rate for fiscal years 2017 and 2016 was 8% and 15%, respectively.\u00a0the decrease in our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2017 compared to fiscal year 2016 was primarily due to the realization of tax benefits attributable to previous phone business losses, offset in part by changes in the mix of our income before income  38part ii item 7 \u00a0 taxes between the u.s. and foreign countries. the fiscal year 2016 effective tax rate included the impact of nondeductible phone charges and valuation allowances. our effective tax rate was lower than the u.s. federal statutory rate primarily due to earnings taxed at lower rates in foreign jurisdictions resulting from producing and distributing our products and services through our foreign regional operations centers in ireland, singapore, and puerto rico. additionally, our effective tax rate in fiscal year 2017 reflects the realization of tax benefits attributable to previous phone business losses. the mix of income before income taxes between the u.s. and foreign countries impacted our effective tax rate as a result of the geographic distribution of, and customer demand for, our products and services. we supply our windows pc operating system to customers through our u.s. regional operating center, while we supply the microsoft office system and our server products and tools to customers through our foreign regional operations centers. in fiscal year 2017, our u.s. income before income taxes was $453 million and our foreign income before income taxes was $22.7 billion. net revenue deferrals related to sales of windows 10 negatively impacted our fiscal year 2017 u.s. income before income taxes by $6.4 billion and foreign income before income taxes by $317 million. in fiscal year 2016, our u.s. loss before income taxes was $325 million and our foreign income before income taxes was $20.1 billion. net revenue deferrals related to sales of windows 10 negatively impacted our fiscal year 2016 u.s. loss by $6.0 billion and foreign income before income taxes by $588 million.  tax contingencies and other income tax liabilities were $13.5 billion and $11.8 billion as of june 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively, and are included in other long-term liabilities. this increase relates primarily to current period intercompany transfer pricing and tax credits. while we settled a portion of the internal revenue service (\u201cirs\u201d) audit for tax years 2004 to 2006 during the third quarter of fiscal year 2011, and settled a portion of the irs audit for tax years 2007 to 2009 during the first quarter of fiscal year 2016, we remain under audit for those years. we also continue to be subject to examination by the irs for tax years 2010 to 2016. in february 2012, the irs withdrew its 2011 revenue agents report for tax years 2004 to 2006 and reopened the audit phase of the examination. as of june 30, 2017, the primary unresolved issue relates to transfer pricing, which could have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements if not resolved favorably. we believe our allowances for income tax contingencies are adequate. we have not received a proposed assessment for the unresolved issues and do not expect a final resolution of these issues in the next 12 months.\u00a0based on the information currently available, we do not anticipate a significant increase or decrease to our tax contingencies for these issues within the next 12 months.  we are subject to income tax in many jurisdictions outside the u.s. our operations in certain jurisdictions remain subject to examination for tax years 1996 to 2017, some of which are currently under audit by local tax authorities. the resolutions of these audits are not expected to be material to our consolidated financial statements.  fiscal year 2016 compared with fiscal year 2015  our effective tax rate for fiscal years 2016 and 2015 was 15% and 34%, respectively.\u00a0our effective tax rate was lower than the u.s. federal statutory rate primarily due to earnings taxed at lower rates in foreign jurisdictions resulting from producing and distributing our products and services through our foreign regional operations centers in ireland, singapore, and puerto rico.  the decrease in our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2016 compared to fiscal year 2015 was primarily due to changes in the mix of our income before income taxes between the u.s. and foreign countries including the impact of net revenue deferrals related to sales of windows 10, tax benefits from the adoption of the new accounting guidance relating to stock-based compensation, and distributions from foreign affiliates. the fiscal year 2015 effective tax rate included the tax impact of losses in foreign jurisdictions for which we may not realize a tax benefit, primarily as a result of impairment and restructuring charges. the mix of income before income taxes between the u.s. and foreign countries impacted our effective tax rate as a result of the geographic distribution of, and customer demand for, our products and services. we supply our windows pc operating system to customers through our u.s. regional operating center, while we supply the microsoft office system and our server products and tools to customers through our foreign regional operations centers. in fiscal year 2016, our u.s. loss before income taxes was $325 million and our foreign income before income taxes was $20.1 billion. net revenue deferrals related to sales of windows 10 negatively impacted our fiscal year 2016 u.s. loss before income taxes by $6.0 billion and foreign income before income taxes by $588 million. in fiscal year 2015, our u.s. income before income taxes was $7.4 billion and our foreign income before income taxes was $11.1 billion. impairment, integration, and restructuring expense relating to our phone business decreased our fiscal year 2015 u.s income before income taxes by $1.1 billion and foreign income before income taxes by $8.9 billion.  39part ii item 7 \u00a0 financial condition  cash, cash equivalents, and investments  cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments totaled $133.0 billion as of june 30, 2017, compared with $113.2 billion as of june\u00a030, 2016. equity and other investments were $6.0 billion as of june 30, 2017, compared with $10.4 billion as of june\u00a030, 2016. our short-term investments are primarily intended to facilitate liquidity and for capital preservation. they consist predominantly of highly liquid investment-grade fixed-income securities, diversified among industries and individual issuers. the investments are predominantly u.s. dollar-denominated securities, but also include foreign currency-denominated securities to diversify risk. our fixed-income investments are exposed to interest rate risk and credit risk. the credit risk and average maturity of our fixed-income portfolio are managed to achieve economic returns that correlate to certain fixed-income indices. the settlement risk related to these investments is insignificant given that the short-term investments held are primarily highly liquid investment-grade fixed-income securities.  of the cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments as of june 30, 2017, $127.9 billion was held by our foreign subsidiaries and would be subject to material repatriation tax effects. the amount of cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments held by foreign subsidiaries subject to other restrictions on the free flow of funds (primarily currency and other local regulatory) was $2.4 billion. as of june 30, 2017, approximately 87% of the cash equivalents and short-term investments held by our foreign subsidiaries were invested in u.s. government and agency securities, approximately 3% were invested in u.s. mortgage- and asset-backed securities, and approximately 2% were invested in corporate notes and bonds of u.s. companies, all of which are denominated in u.s. dollars. the remaining cash equivalents and short-term investments held by our foreign subsidiaries were primarily invested in foreign securities. securities lending  we lend certain fixed-income and equity securities to increase investment returns. the loaned securities continue to be carried as investments on our consolidated balance sheets. cash and/or security interests are received as collateral for the loaned securities with the amount determined based upon the underlying security lent and the creditworthiness of the borrower. cash collateral received is recorded as an asset with a corresponding liability. our securities lending payable balance was $97 million as of june 30, 2017. our average and maximum securities lending payable balances for fiscal year 2017 were $484 million and $1.5 billion, respectively. intra-year variances in the amount of securities loaned are mainly due to fluctuations in the demand for the securities.  valuation  in general, and where applicable, we use quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities to determine the fair value of our financial instruments. this pricing methodology applies to our level 1 investments, such as u.s. government securities, domestic and international equities, and exchange-traded mutual funds. if quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities are not available to determine fair value, then we use quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities or inputs other than the quoted prices that are observable either directly or indirectly. this pricing methodology applies to our level 2 investments such as foreign government bonds, corporate notes and bonds, mortgage- and asset-backed securities, u.s. government and agency securities, common and preferred stock, and certificates of deposit. level 3 investments are valued using internally developed models with unobservable inputs. assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis using unobservable inputs are an immaterial portion of our portfolio.  a majority of our investments are priced by pricing vendors and are generally level 1 or level 2 investments as these vendors either provide a quoted market price in an active market or use observable inputs for their pricing without applying significant adjustments. broker pricing is used mainly when a quoted price is not available, the investment is not priced by our pricing vendors, or when a broker price is more reflective of fair values in the market in which the investment trades. our broker-priced investments are generally classified as level 2 investments because the broker prices these investments based on similar assets without applying significant adjustments. in addition, all our broker-priced investments have a sufficient level of trading volume to demonstrate that the fair values used are appropriate for these investments. our fair value processes include controls that are designed to ensure appropriate fair values are recorded. these controls include model validation, review of key model inputs, analysis of period-over-period fluctuations, and independent recalculation of prices where appropriate.  40part ii item 7 \u00a0 cash flows  fiscal year 2017 compared with fiscal year 2016  cash from operations increased $6.2 billion to $39.5 billion during the fiscal year, mainly due to an increase in cash received from customers and an income tax refund for overpayment of estimated taxes, offset in part by an increase in cash paid to employees. cash from financing increased $16.8 billion to $8.4 billion, mainly due to a $13.2 billion increase in proceeds from issuances of debt, net of repayments, and a $4.2 billion decrease in cash used for common stock repurchases, offset in part by an $839 million increase in dividends paid. cash used in investing increased $22.8 billion to $46.8 billion, mainly due to a $24.6 billion increase in cash used for acquisitions of companies, net of cash acquired, and purchases of intangibles and other assets, offset in part by a $1.9 billion decrease in cash used for net investment purchases, sales, and maturities.  fiscal year 2016 compared with fiscal year 2015  cash from operations increased $3.7 billion to $33.3 billion during the fiscal year, mainly due to lower operating expenditures and a reduction in materials and production costs, offset in part by a decrease in cash received from customers. cash used in financing decreased $1.3 billion to $8.4 billion, mainly due to a $4.6 billion increase in proceeds from issuances of debt, net of repayments, offset in part by a $1.5 billion increase in cash used for common stock repurchases and a $1.1 billion increase in dividends paid. cash used in investing increased $949 million to $24.0 billion, mainly due to a $2.4 billion increase in cash used for additions to property and equipment and a $1.5 billion increase in cash used for net investment purchases, sales, and maturities, offset in part by a $2.3 billion decrease in cash used for acquisitions of companies, net of cash acquired, and purchases of intangibles and other assets.  debt  we issued debt to take advantage of favorable pricing and liquidity in the debt markets, reflecting our credit rating and the low interest rate environment. the proceeds of these issuances were or will be used for general corporate purposes, which may include, among other things, funding for working capital, capital expenditures, repurchases of capital stock, acquisitions, and repayment of existing debt. see note 12 \u2013 debt of the notes to financial statements (part ii, item\u00a08 of this form 10-k) for further discussion. unearned revenue  unearned revenue as of june 30, 2017 was comprised mainly of unearned revenue from volume licensing programs. unearned revenue from volume licensing programs represents customer billings for multi-year licensing arrangements paid for either at inception of the agreement or annually at the beginning of each coverage period and accounted for as subscriptions with revenue recognized ratably over the coverage period. unearned revenue as of june 30, 2017 also included payments for: windows 10 licenses; post-delivery support and consulting services to be performed in the future; office 365 subscriptions; linkedin; xbox live subscriptions; dynamics business solutions products; skype prepaid credits and subscriptions; and other offerings for which we have been paid in advance and earn the revenue when we provide the service or software, or otherwise meet the revenue recognition criteria.  the following table outlines the expected future recognition of unearned revenue as of june 30, 2017:  \u00a0   41part ii item 7 \u00a0 if our customers choose to license cloud-based versions of our products and services rather than licensing transaction-based products and services, the associated revenue will shift from being recognized at the time of the transaction to being recognized over the subscription period or upon consumption, as applicable.  share repurchases  during fiscal year 2017, 2016, and 2015, we repurchased 170 million shares, 294 million shares, and 295 million shares of our common stock for $10.3 billion, $14.8 billion, and $13.2 billion, respectively, through our share repurchase programs. all repurchases were made using cash resources. see note 18 \u2013 stockholders\u2019 equity of the notes to financial statements (part ii, item\u00a08 of this form 10-k) for further discussion. dividends  see note 18 \u2013 stockholders\u2019 equity of the notes to financial statements (part ii, item\u00a08 of this form 10-k) for further discussion. off-balance sheet arrangements  we provide indemnifications of varying scope and size to certain customers against claims of intellectual property infringement made by third parties arising from the use of our products and certain other matters. additionally, we have agreed to cover damages resulting from breaches of certain security and privacy commitments in our cloud business. in evaluating estimated losses on these indemnifications, we consider factors such as the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and our ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss. these obligations did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements during the periods presented.  contractual obligations  the following table summarizes the payments due by fiscal year for our outstanding contractual obligations as of june 30, 2017:  \u00a0           42part ii item 7 \u00a0 other planned uses of capital  we will continue to invest in sales, marketing, product support infrastructure, and existing and advanced areas of technology, as well as continue making acquisitions that align with our business strategy. additions to property and equipment will continue, including new facilities, datacenters, and computer systems for research and development, sales and marketing, support, and administrative staff. we expect capital expenditures to increase in coming years to support growth in our cloud offerings. we have operating leases for most u.s. and international sales and support offices and certain equipment. we have not engaged in any related party transactions or arrangements with unconsolidated entities or other persons that are reasonably likely to materially affect liquidity or the availability of capital resources.  liquidity  we earn a significant amount of our operating income outside the u.s., which is deemed to be permanently reinvested in foreign jurisdictions. as a result, as discussed above under cash, cash equivalents, and investments, the majority of our cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments are held by foreign subsidiaries. we currently do not intend nor foresee a need to repatriate these funds. we expect existing domestic cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, cash flows from operations, and access to capital markets to continue to be sufficient to fund our domestic operating activities and cash commitments for investing and financing activities, such as regular quarterly dividends, debt maturities, and material capital expenditures, for at least the next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future. in addition, we expect existing foreign cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, and cash flows from operations to continue to be sufficient to fund our foreign operating activities and cash commitments for investing activities, such as material capital expenditures, for at least the next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future.  should we require more capital in the u.s. than is generated by our operations domestically, for example to fund significant discretionary activities, such as business acquisitions and share repurchases, we could elect to repatriate future earnings from foreign jurisdictions or raise capital in the u.s. through debt or equity issuances. these alternatives could result in higher effective tax rates, increased interest expense, or dilution of our earnings. we have borrowed funds domestically and continue to believe we have the ability to do so at reasonable interest rates.  recent accounting guidance  see note 1 \u2013 accounting policies of the notes to financial statements (part ii, item\u00a08 of this form 10-k) for further discussion. application of critical accounting policies  our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with u.s. gaap. preparing consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. these estimates and assumptions are affected by management\u2019s application of accounting policies. critical accounting policies for us include revenue recognition, impairment of investment securities, goodwill, research and development costs, contingencies, income taxes, and inventories.  revenue recognition  revenue recognition for multiple-element arrangements requires judgment to determine if multiple elements exist, whether elements can be accounted for as separate units of accounting, and if so, the fair value for each of the elements.  judgment is also required to assess whether future releases of certain software represent new products or upgrades and enhancements to existing products. certain volume licensing arrangements include a perpetual license for current products combined with rights to receive unspecified future versions of software products and are accounted for as subscriptions, with billings recorded as unearned revenue and recognized as revenue ratably over the coverage period.  43part ii item 7 \u00a0 software updates are evaluated on a case-by-case basis to determine whether they meet the definition of an upgrade, which may require revenue to be deferred and recognized when the upgrade is delivered. if it is determined that implied post-contract customer support (\u201cpcs\u201d) is being provided, revenue from the arrangement is deferred and recognized over the implied pcs term. if updates are determined to not meet the definition of an upgrade, revenue is generally recognized as products are shipped or made available.  microsoft enters into arrangements that can include various combinations of software, services, and hardware. where elements are delivered over different periods of time, and when allowed under u.s. gaap, revenue is allocated to the respective elements based on their relative selling prices at the inception of the arrangement, and revenue is recognized as each element is delivered. we use a hierarchy to determine the fair value to be used for allocating revenue to elements: (i)\u00a0vendor-specific objective evidence of fair value (\u201cvsoe\u201d), (ii)\u00a0third-party evidence, and (iii)\u00a0best estimate of selling price (\u201cesp\u201d). for software elements, we follow the industry-specific software guidance which only allows for the use of vsoe in establishing fair value. generally, vsoe is the price charged when the deliverable is sold separately or the price established by management for a product that is not yet sold if it is probable that the price will not change before introduction into the marketplace. esps are established as best estimates of what the selling prices would be if the deliverables were sold regularly on a stand-alone basis. our process for determining esps requires judgment and considers multiple factors that may vary over time depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each deliverable.  customers purchasing a windows 10 license will receive unspecified updates and upgrades over the life of their windows 10 device at no additional cost. as these updates and upgrades will not be sold on a stand-alone basis, we are unable to establish vsoe. accordingly, revenue from licenses of windows 10 is recognized ratably over the estimated life of the related device, which ranges between two to four years.  the new standard related to revenue recognition will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. see note 1 \u2013 accounting policies in the notes to financial statements (part ii, item\u00a08 of this form 10-k) for further discussion.  impairment of investment securities  we review investments quarterly for indicators of other-than-temporary impairment. this determination requires significant judgment. in making this judgment, we employ a systematic methodology quarterly that considers available quantitative and qualitative evidence in evaluating potential impairment of our investments. if the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value, we evaluate, among other factors, general market conditions, credit quality of debt instrument issuers, the duration and extent to which the fair value is less than cost, and for equity securities, our intent and ability to hold, or plans to sell, the investment. for fixed-income securities, we also evaluate whether we have plans to sell the security or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery. we also consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of and business outlook for the investee, including industry and sector performance, changes in technology, and operational and financing cash flow factors. once a decline in fair value is determined to be other-than-temporary, an impairment charge is recorded to other income (expense), net and a new cost basis in the investment is established. if market, industry, and/or investee conditions deteriorate, we may incur future impairments.  goodwill  we allocate goodwill to reporting units based on the reporting unit expected to benefit from the business combination. we evaluate our reporting units on an annual basis and, if necessary, reassign goodwill using a relative fair value allocation approach. goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level (operating segment or one level below an operating segment) on an annual basis (may 1 for us) and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. these events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate, legal factors, operating performance indicators, competition, or sale or disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit.  application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment, including the identification of reporting units, assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units, assignment of goodwill to reporting units, and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit. the fair value of each reporting unit is estimated primarily through the use of a discounted cash flow methodology. this analysis requires significant judgments, including estimation of future cash flows, which is dependent on internal forecasts, estimation of the long-term rate of growth for our business, estimation of the useful life over which cash flows will occur, and determination of our weighted average cost of capital.  44part ii item 7 \u00a0 the estimates used to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit change from year to year based on operating results, market conditions, and other factors. changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and goodwill impairment for each reporting unit.  research and development costs  costs incurred internally in researching and developing a computer software product are charged to expense until technological feasibility has been established for the product. once technological feasibility is established, all software costs are capitalized until the product is available for general release to customers. judgment is required in determining when technological feasibility of a product is established. we have determined that technological feasibility for our software products is reached after all high-risk development issues have been resolved through coding and testing. generally, this occurs shortly before the products are released to production. the amortization of these costs is included in cost of revenue over the estimated life of the products.  legal and other contingencies  the outcomes of legal proceedings and claims brought against us are subject to significant uncertainty. an estimated loss from a loss contingency such as a legal proceeding or claim is accrued by a charge to income if it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. in determining whether a loss should be accrued we evaluate, among other factors, the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss. changes in these factors could materially impact our consolidated financial statements. income taxes  the objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entity\u2019s financial statements or tax returns. we recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. accounting literature also provides guidance on derecognition of income tax assets and liabilities, classification of deferred income tax assets and liabilities, accounting for interest and penalties associated with tax positions, and income tax disclosures. judgment is required in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized on our consolidated financial statements or tax returns. variations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could materially impact our consolidated financial statements.  inventories  inventories are stated at average cost, subject to the lower of cost or market. cost includes materials, labor, and manufacturing overhead related to the purchase and production of inventories. we regularly review inventory quantities on hand, future purchase commitments with our suppliers, and the estimated utility of our inventory. these reviews include analysis of demand forecasts, product life cycle status, product development plans, current sales levels, pricing strategy, and component cost trends. if our review indicates a reduction in utility below carrying value, we reduce our inventory to a new cost basis through a charge to cost of revenue.  \u00a0 45part ii item 7 \u00a0 statement of management\u2019s responsibility for financial statements  management is responsible for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements and related information that are presented in this report. the consolidated financial statements, which include amounts based on management\u2019s estimates and judgments, have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america.  the company designs and maintains accounting and internal control systems to provide reasonable assurance at reasonable cost that assets are safeguarded against loss from unauthorized use or disposition, and that the financial records are reliable for preparing consolidated financial statements and maintaining accountability for assets. these systems are augmented by written policies, an organizational structure providing division of responsibilities, careful selection and training of qualified personnel, and a program of internal audits.  the company engaged deloitte\u00a0& touche llp, an independent registered public accounting firm, to audit and render an opinion on the consolidated financial statements and internal control over financial reporting in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board (united states).  the board of directors, through its audit committee, consisting solely of independent directors of the company, meets periodically with management, internal auditors, and our independent registered public accounting firm to ensure that each is meeting its responsibilities and to discuss matters concerning internal controls and financial reporting. deloitte\u00a0& touche llp and the internal auditors each have full and free access to the audit committee.  \u00a0   \u00a0 \u00a0 46part ii item 7a \u00a0 item\u00a07a.\u00a0quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk  risks  we are exposed to economic risk from foreign exchange rates, interest rates, credit risk, equity prices, and commodity prices. a portion of these risks is hedged, but they may impact our consolidated financial statements.  foreign currency  certain forecasted transactions, assets, and liabilities are exposed to foreign currency risk. we monitor our foreign currency exposures daily and use hedges where practicable to offset the risks and maximize the economic effectiveness of our foreign currency positions. principal currencies hedged include the euro, japanese yen, british pound, canadian dollar, and australian dollar.  interest rate  our fixed-income portfolio is diversified across credit sectors and maturities, consisting primarily of investment-grade securities. the credit risk and average maturity of the fixed-income portfolio is managed to achieve economic returns that correlate to certain global and domestic fixed-income indices. in addition, we use \u201cto be announced\u201d forward purchase commitments of mortgage-backed assets to gain exposure to agency mortgage-backed securities.  equity  our equity portfolio consists of global, developed, and emerging market securities that are subject to market price risk.\u00a0we manage the securities relative to certain global and domestic indices and expect their economic risk and return to correlate with these indices.  commodity  we use broad-based commodity exposures to enhance portfolio returns and facilitate portfolio diversification. our investment portfolio has exposure to a variety of commodities, including precious metals, energy, and grain. we manage these exposures relative to global commodity indices and expect their economic risk and return to correlate with these indices.  value-at-risk  we use a value-at-risk (\u201cvar\u201d) model to estimate and quantify our market risks. var is the expected loss, for a given confidence level, in the fair value of our portfolio due to adverse market movements over a defined time horizon. the var model is not intended to represent actual losses in fair value, including determinations of other-than-temporary losses in fair value in accordance with u.s. gaap, but is used as a risk estimation and management tool. the distribution of the potential changes in total market value of all holdings is computed based on the historical volatilities and correlations among foreign exchange rates, interest rates, equity prices, and commodity prices, assuming normal market conditions.  the var is calculated as the total loss that will not be exceeded at the 97.5 percentile confidence level or, alternatively stated, the losses could exceed the var in 25 out of 1,000 cases. several risk factors are not captured in the model, including liquidity risk, operational risk, and legal risk.  47part ii item 7a \u00a0 the following table sets forth the one-day var for substantially all of our positions as of june 30, 2017 and 2016 and for the year ended june 30, 2017:  \u00a0   total one-day var for the combined risk categories was $207 million and $225 million as of june\u00a030, 2017 and 2016. the total var is 35% and 29% less as of june 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively, than the sum of the separate risk categories in the table above due to the diversification benefit of the combination of risks.  \u00a0 \u00a0 48part ii item 8 \u00a0 comprehensive income statements  \u00a0   see accompanying notes. refer to note 19 \u2014 accumulated other comprehensive income for further information. \u00a0 50part ii item 8 \u00a0 notes to financial statements  note 1 \u2014 accounting policies  accounting principles  the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america (\u201cu.s. gaap\u201d).  we have recast certain prior period amounts to conform to the current period presentation, with no impact on consolidated net income or cash flows.  principles of consolidation  the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of microsoft corporation and its subsidiaries. intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated. equity investments through which we are able to exercise significant influence over but do not control the investee and are not the primary beneficiary of the investee\u2019s activities are accounted for using the equity method. investments through which we are not able to exercise significant influence over the investee and which do not have readily determinable fair values are accounted for under the cost method.  estimates and assumptions  preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. examples of estimates include: loss contingencies; product warranties; the fair value of and/or potential impairment of goodwill and intangible assets for our reporting units; product life cycles; useful lives of our tangible and intangible assets; allowances for doubtful accounts; allowances for product returns; the market value of, and demand for, our inventory; and stock-based compensation forfeiture rates. examples of assumptions include: the elements comprising a software arrangement, including the distinction between upgrades or enhancements and new products; when technological feasibility is achieved for our products; the potential outcome of future tax consequences of events that have been recognized on our consolidated financial statements or tax returns; and determining when investment impairments are other-than-temporary. actual results and outcomes may differ from management\u2019s estimates and assumptions.  foreign currencies  assets and liabilities recorded in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rate on the balance sheet date. revenue and expenses are translated at average rates of exchange prevailing during the year. translation adjustments resulting from this process are recorded to other comprehensive income (\u201coci\u201d).  product revenue and service and other revenue  product revenue includes sales from operating systems; cross-device productivity applications; server applications; business solution applications; desktop and server management tools; software development tools; video games; hardware such as pcs, tablets, gaming and entertainment consoles, phones, other intelligent devices, and related accessories; and training and certification of computer system integrators and developers.  service and other revenue includes sales from cloud-based solutions that provide customers with software, services, platforms, and content such as microsoft office 365, microsoft azure, microsoft dynamics 365, and xbox live; solution support; and consulting services. service and other revenue also includes sales from online advertising and linkedin.  revenue recognition  revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the fee is fixed or determinable, and collectability is probable. revenue generally is recognized net of allowances for returns and any taxes collected from customers and subsequently remitted to governmental authorities. 54part ii item 8 \u00a0 revenue recognition for multiple-element arrangements requires judgment to determine if multiple elements exist, whether elements can be accounted for as separate units of accounting, and if so, the fair value for each of the elements.  microsoft enters into arrangements that can include various combinations of software, services, and hardware. where elements are delivered over different periods of time, and when allowed under u.s. gaap, revenue is allocated to the respective elements based on their relative selling prices at the inception of the arrangement, and revenue is recognized as each element is delivered. we use a hierarchy to determine the fair value to be used for allocating revenue to elements: (i) vendor-specific objective evidence of fair value (\u201cvsoe\u201d), (ii) third-party evidence, and (iii) best estimate of selling price (\u201cesp\u201d). for software elements, we follow the industry specific software guidance which only allows for the use of vsoe in establishing fair value. generally, vsoe is the price charged when the deliverable is sold separately or the price established by management for a product that is not yet sold if it is probable that the price will not change before introduction into the marketplace. esps are established as best estimates of what the selling prices would be if the deliverables were sold regularly on a stand-alone basis. our process for determining esps requires judgment and considers multiple factors that may vary over time depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each deliverable. revenue for retail packaged products, products licensed to original equipment manufacturers (\u201coems\u201d), and perpetual licenses under certain volume licensing programs generally is recognized as products are shipped or made available. technology guarantee programs are accounted for as multiple-element arrangements as customers receive free or significantly discounted rights to use upcoming new versions of a software product if they license existing versions of the product during the eligibility period. revenue is allocated between the existing product and the new product, and revenue allocated to the new product is deferred until that version is delivered. the revenue allocation is based on the vsoe of fair value of the products. the vsoe of fair value for upcoming new products are based on the price determined by management having the relevant authority when the element is not yet sold separately, but is expected to be sold in the near future at the price set by management.  software updates that will be provided free of charge are evaluated on a case-by-case basis to determine whether they meet the definition of an upgrade and create a multiple-element arrangement, which may require revenue to be deferred and recognized when the upgrade is delivered, or if it is determined that implied post-contract customer support (\u201cpcs\u201d) is being provided, the arrangement is accounted for as a multiple-element arrangement and all revenue from the arrangement is deferred and recognized over the implied pcs term when the vsoe of fair value does not exist. if updates are determined to not meet the definition of an upgrade, revenue is generally recognized as products are shipped or made available.  customers purchasing a windows 10 license will receive unspecified updates and upgrades over the life of their windows 10 device at no additional cost. as these updates and upgrades will not be sold on a stand-alone basis, we are unable to establish vsoe of fair value. accordingly, revenue from licenses of windows 10 is recognized ratably over the estimated life of the related device, which ranges between two to four years. certain volume licensing arrangements include a perpetual license for current products combined with rights to receive unspecified future versions of software products, which we have determined are additional software products and are therefore accounted for as subscriptions, with billings recorded as unearned revenue and recognized as revenue ratably over the coverage period. arrangements that include term-based licenses for current products with the right to use unspecified future versions of the software during the coverage period, are also accounted for as subscriptions, with revenue recognized ratably over the coverage period. revenue from cloud-based services arrangements that allow for the use of a hosted software product or service over a contractually determined period of time without taking possession of software are accounted for as subscriptions with billings recorded as unearned revenue and recognized as revenue ratably over the coverage period beginning on the date the service is made available to customers. revenue from cloud-based services arrangements that are provided on a consumption basis (for example, the amount of storage used in a particular period) is recognized commensurate with the customer utilization of such resources.  some volume licensing arrangements include time-based subscriptions for cloud-based services and software offerings that are accounted for as subscriptions. these arrangements are considered multiple-element arrangements. however, because all elements are accounted for as subscriptions and have the same coverage period and delivery pattern, they have the same revenue recognition timing.  55part ii item 8 \u00a0 revenue related to surface devices, xbox consoles, games published by us, phones, and other hardware components is generally recognized when ownership is transferred to the resellers or to end customers when selling directly through microsoft retail stores and online marketplaces. a portion of revenue may be deferred when these products are combined with software elements, and/or services. revenue related to licensing for games published by third parties for use on the xbox consoles is recognized when games are manufactured by the game publishers.  display advertising revenue is recognized as advertisements are displayed. search advertising revenue is recognized when the ad appears in the search results or when the action necessary to earn the revenue has been completed. consulting services revenue is recognized as services are rendered, generally based on the negotiated hourly rate in the consulting arrangement and the number of hours worked during the period. consulting revenue for fixed-price services arrangements is recognized as services are provided.  cost of revenue  cost of revenue includes: manufacturing and distribution costs for products sold and programs licensed; operating costs related to product support service centers and product distribution centers; costs incurred to include software on pcs sold by oems, to drive traffic to our websites, and to acquire online advertising space; costs incurred to support and maintain internet-based products and services, including datacenter costs and royalties; warranty costs; inventory valuation adjustments; costs associated with the delivery of consulting services; and the amortization of capitalized software development costs. capitalized software development costs are amortized over the estimated lives of the products.  product warranty  we provide for the estimated costs of fulfilling our obligations under hardware and software warranties at the time the related revenue is recognized. for hardware warranties, we estimate the costs based on historical and projected product failure rates, historical and projected repair costs, and knowledge of specific product failures (if any). the specific hardware warranty terms and conditions vary depending upon the product sold and the country in which we do business, but generally include parts and labor over a period generally ranging from 90\u00a0days to three years. for software warranties, we estimate the costs to provide bug fixes, such as security patches, over the estimated life of the software. we regularly reevaluate our estimates to assess the adequacy of the recorded warranty liabilities and adjust the amounts as necessary.  research and development  research and development expenses include payroll, employee benefits, stock-based compensation expense, and other headcount-related expenses associated with product development. research and development expenses also include third-party development and programming costs, localization costs incurred to translate software for international markets, and the amortization of purchased software code and services content. such costs related to software development are included in research and development expense until the point that technological feasibility is reached, which for our software products, is generally shortly before the products are released to production. once technological feasibility is reached, such costs are capitalized and amortized to cost of revenue over the estimated lives of the products.  sales and marketing  sales and marketing expenses include payroll, employee benefits, stock-based compensation expense, and other headcount-related expenses associated with sales and marketing personnel, and the costs of advertising, promotions, trade shows, seminars, and other programs. advertising costs are expensed as incurred. advertising expense was $1.5 billion, $1.6 billion, and $1.9 billion in fiscal years 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively.  stock-based compensation  compensation cost for stock awards, which include restricted stock units (\u201crsus\u201d) and performance stock units (\u201cpsus\u201d), is measured at the fair value on the grant date and recognized as expense, net of estimated forfeitures, over the related service or performance period. the fair value of stock awards is based on the quoted price of our common stock on the grant date less the present value of expected dividends not received during the vesting period. we measure the fair value of psus using a monte carlo valuation model. compensation cost for rsus is recognized using the straight-line method and for psus is recognized using the accelerated method.  56part ii item 8 \u00a0 compensation expense for the employee stock purchase plan (\u201cespp\u201d) is measured as the discount the employee is entitled to upon purchase and is recognized in the period of purchase.  income taxes  income tax expense includes u.s. and international income taxes, the provision for u.s. taxes on undistributed earnings of international subsidiaries not deemed to be permanently reinvested, and interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions. certain income and expenses are not reported in tax returns and financial statements in the same year. the tax effect of such temporary differences is reported as deferred income taxes. deferred tax assets are reported net of a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized. all deferred income taxes are classified as long-term on our consolidated balance sheets.  fair value measurements  we account for certain assets and liabilities at fair value. the hierarchy below lists three levels of fair value based on the extent to which inputs used in measuring fair value are observable in the market.\u00a0we categorize each of our fair value measurements in one of these three levels based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. these levels are:        we measure certain assets, including our cost and equity method investments, at fair value on a nonrecurring basis when they are deemed to be other-than-temporarily impaired. the fair values of these investments are determined based on valuation techniques using the best information available, and may include quoted market prices, market comparables, and discounted cash flow projections. an impairment charge is recorded when the cost of the investment exceeds its fair value and this condition is determined to be other-than-temporary.  our other current financial assets and our current financial liabilities have fair values that approximate their carrying values.  financial instruments  investments we consider all highly liquid interest-earning investments with a maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase to be cash equivalents. the fair values of these investments approximate their carrying values. in general, investments with original maturities of greater than three months and remaining maturities of less than one year are classified as short-term investments. investments with maturities beyond one year may be classified as short-term  57part ii item 8 \u00a0 based on their highly liquid nature and because such marketable securities represent the investment of cash that is available for current operations. all cash equivalents and short-term investments are classified as available-for-sale and realized gains and losses are recorded using the specific identification method. changes in market value, excluding other-than-temporary impairments, are reflected in oci.  equity and other investments classified as long-term include both debt and equity instruments. debt and publicly-traded equity securities are classified as available-for-sale and realized gains and losses are recorded using the specific identification method. changes in the market value of available-for-sale securities, excluding other-than-temporary impairments, are reflected in oci. common and preferred stock and other investments that are restricted for more than one year or are not publicly traded are recorded at cost or using the equity method.  we lend certain fixed-income and equity securities to increase investment returns. these transactions are accounted for as secured borrowings and the loaned securities continue to be carried as investments on our consolidated balance sheets. cash and/or security interests are received as collateral for the loaned securities with the amount determined based upon the underlying security lent and the creditworthiness of the borrower. cash received is recorded as an asset with a corresponding liability.  investments are considered to be impaired when a decline in fair value is judged to be other-than-temporary. fair value is calculated based on publicly available market information or other estimates determined by management. we employ a systematic methodology on a quarterly basis that considers available quantitative and qualitative evidence in evaluating potential impairment of our investments. if the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value, we evaluate, among other factors, general market conditions, credit quality of debt instrument issuers, the duration and extent to which the fair value is less than cost, and for equity securities, our intent and ability to hold, or plans to sell, the investment. for fixed-income securities, we also evaluate whether we have plans to sell the security or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery. we also consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of and business outlook for the investee, including industry and sector performance, changes in technology, and operational and financing cash flow factors. once a decline in fair value is determined to be other-than-temporary, an impairment charge is recorded to other income (expense), net and a new cost basis in the investment is established.  derivatives derivative instruments are recognized as either assets or liabilities and are measured at fair value. the accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation.  for derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges, the gains (losses) are recognized in earnings in the periods of change together with the offsetting losses (gains) on the hedged items attributed to the risk being hedged. for options designated as fair value hedges, changes in the time value are excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and are recognized in earnings.  for derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges, the effective portion of the gains (losses) on the derivatives is initially reported as a component of oci and is subsequently recognized in earnings when the hedged exposure is recognized in earnings. for options designated as cash flow hedges, changes in the time value are excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and are recognized in earnings. gains (losses) on derivatives representing either hedge components excluded from the assessment of effectiveness or hedge ineffectiveness are recognized in earnings.  for derivative instruments that are not designated as hedges, gains (losses) from changes in fair values are primarily recognized in other income (expense), net. other than those derivatives entered into for investment purposes, such as commodity contracts, the gains (losses) are generally economically offset by unrealized gains (losses) in the underlying available-for-sale securities, which are recorded as a component of oci until the securities are sold or other-than-temporarily impaired, at which time the amounts are reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income (\u201caoci\u201d) into other income (expense), net.  58part ii item 8 \u00a0 allowance for doubtful accounts  the allowance for doubtful accounts reflects our best estimate of probable losses inherent in the accounts receivable balance. we determine the allowance based on known troubled accounts, historical experience, and other currently available evidence. activity in the allowance for doubtful accounts was as follows:  \u00a0   \u00a0 inventories  inventories are stated at average cost, subject to the lower of cost or market. cost includes materials, labor, and manufacturing overhead related to the purchase and production of inventories. we regularly review inventory quantities on hand, future purchase commitments with our suppliers, and the estimated utility of our inventory. if our review indicates a reduction in utility below carrying value, we reduce our inventory to a new cost basis through a charge to cost of revenue.  property and equipment  property and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation, and depreciated using the straight-line method over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the asset or the lease term. the estimated useful lives of our property and equipment are generally as follows: computer software developed or acquired for internal use, three to seven years; computer equipment, two to three years; buildings and improvements, five to 15 years; leasehold improvements, three to 20 years; and furniture and equipment, one to 10 years. land is not depreciated.  goodwill  goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level (operating segment or one level below an operating segment) on an annual basis (may 1 for us) and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value.  intangible assets  all of our intangible assets are subject to amortization and are amortized using the straight-line method over their estimated period of benefit, ranging from one to 15 years. we evaluate the recoverability of intangible assets periodically by taking into account events or circumstances that may warrant revised estimates of useful lives or that indicate the asset may be impaired.  recent accounting guidance  accounting for income taxes \u2013 intra-entity asset transfers in october 2016, the financial accounting standards board (\u201cfasb\u201d) issued new guidance requiring an entity to recognize the income tax consequences of an intra-entity transfer of an asset other than inventory when the transfer occurs, rather than when the asset has been sold to an outside party. this guidance is effective for us beginning july 1, 2018, with early adoption permitted beginning july 1, 2017. we plan to adopt the guidance effective july 1, 2018. adoption of the guidance will be applied using a modified retrospective approach through a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the effective date. a cumulative-effect adjustment will capture the write-off of income tax consequences deferred from past intra-entity transfers involving assets other than inventory and new deferred tax assets for amounts not recognized under current u.s. gaap. we anticipate this guidance will have a material impact on our consolidated balance sheets upon adoption, and continue to evaluate any impacts to our accounting policies, processes, and systems. 59part ii item 8 \u00a0 financial instruments \u2013 credit losses  in june 2016, the fasb issued a new standard to replace the incurred loss impairment methodology under current u.s. gaap with a methodology that reflects expected credit losses and requires consideration of a broader range of reasonable and supportable information to inform credit loss estimates. we will be required to use a forward-looking expected credit loss model for accounts receivables, loans, and other financial instruments. credit losses relating to available-for-sale debt securities will also be recorded through an allowance for credit losses rather than as a reduction in the amortized cost basis of the securities. the standard will be effective for us beginning july\u00a01, 2020, with early adoption permitted beginning july\u00a01, 2019. adoption of the standard will be applied using a modified retrospective approach through a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the effective date. we are currently evaluating the impact of this standard on our consolidated financial statements, including accounting policies, processes, and systems.\u00a0\u00a0 leases  in february 2016, the fasb issued a new standard related to leases to increase transparency and comparability among organizations by requiring the recognition of right-of-use (\u201crou\u201d) assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet. most prominent among the changes in the standard is the recognition of rou assets and lease liabilities by lessees for those leases classified as operating leases under current u.s. gaap. under the standard, disclosures are required to meet the objective of enabling users of financial statements to assess the amount, timing, and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases. we will be required to recognize and measure leases existing at, or entered into after, the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented using a modified retrospective approach, with certain practical expedients available.  the standard will be effective for us beginning july\u00a01, 2019, with early adoption permitted. we elected to early adopt the standard effective july\u00a01, 2017 concurrent with our adoption of the new standard related to revenue recognition.\u00a0we elected the available practical expedients on adoption. in preparation for adoption of the standard, we have implemented internal controls and key system functionality to enable the preparation of financial information.  the standard will have a material impact on our consolidated balance sheets, but will not have a material impact on our consolidated income statements. the most significant impact will be the recognition of rou assets and lease liabilities for operating leases, while our accounting for capital leases remains substantially unchanged.  adoption of the standard will result in the recognition of additional rou assets and lease liabilities for operating leases of $6.6 billion and $5.2 billion as of june 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively. see expected impacts to reported results below for the impact of adoption of the standard on our consolidated financial statements. financial instruments \u2013 recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure  in january 2016, the fasb issued a new standard related to certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure of financial instruments. most prominent among the changes in the standard is the requirement for changes in the fair value of our equity investments, with certain exceptions, to be recognized through net income rather than oci. the standard will be effective for us beginning july\u00a01, 2018. adoption of the standard will be applied using a modified retrospective approach through a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the effective date. we are currently evaluating the impact of this standard on our consolidated financial statements, including accounting policies, processes, and systems.\u00a0\u00a0 revenue from contracts with customers  in may 2014, the fasb issued a new standard related to revenue recognition. under the standard, revenue is recognized when a customer obtains control of promised goods or services in an amount that reflects the consideration the entity expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. in addition, the standard requires disclosure of the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers.  the guidance permits two methods of adoption: retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented (full retrospective method), or retrospectively with the cumulative effect of initially applying the guidance recognized at the date of initial application (modified retrospective method). we will adopt the standard using the full retrospective method to restate each prior reporting period presented.  60part ii item 8 \u00a0 the standard will be effective for us beginning july\u00a01, 2018, with early adoption permitted. we elected to early adopt the standard effective july\u00a01, 2017. in preparation for adoption of the standard, we have implemented internal controls and key system functionality to enable the preparation of financial information and have reached conclusions on key accounting assessments related to the standard, including our assessment that the impact of accounting for costs incurred to obtain a contract is immaterial. the most significant impact of the standard relates to our accounting for software license revenue. specifically, for windows 10, we will recognize revenue predominantly at the time of billing and delivery rather than ratably over the life of the related device. for certain multi-year commercial software subscriptions that include both distinct software licenses and software assurance, we will recognize license revenue at the time of contract execution rather than over the subscription period. due to the complexity of certain of our commercial license subscription contracts, the actual revenue recognition treatment required under the standard will depend on contract-specific terms and in some instances may vary from recognition at the time of billing. revenue recognition related to our hardware, cloud offerings such as office 365, linkedin, and professional services will remain substantially unchanged. adoption of the standard will result in the recognition of additional revenue of $6.6 billion and $5.8 billion for fiscal year 2017 and 2016, respectively, and an increase in the provision for income taxes of $2.5 billion and $2.1 billion, respectively, primarily due to the net change in windows 10 revenue recognition. in addition, adoption of the standard will result in an increase in accounts receivable and other current and long-term assets of $2.7 billion and $4.2 billion, as of june 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively, driven by unbilled receivables from upfront recognition of revenue for certain multi-year commercial software subscriptions that include both distinct software licenses and software assurance; a reduction of unearned revenue of $17.8 billion and $11.7 billion as of june 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively, driven by the upfront recognition of license revenue from windows 10 and certain multi-year commercial software subscriptions; and an increase in deferred income taxes of $5.2 billion and $4.8 billion as of june 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively, driven by the upfront recognition of revenue. see expected impacts to reported results below for the impact of adoption of the standard on our consolidated financial statements.  expected impacts to reported results  adoption of the standards related to revenue recognition and leases is expected to impact our reported results as follows:  \u00a0   \u00a0   61part ii item 8 \u00a0 \u00a0   \u00a0   \u00a0 adoption of the standards related to revenue recognition and leases had no impact to cash from or used in operating, financing, or investing on our consolidated cash flows statements. note 2 \u2014 earnings per share basic earnings per share (\u201ceps\u201d) is computed based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. diluted eps is computed based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock plus the effect of dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period using the treasury stock method. dilutive potential common shares include outstanding stock options and stock awards. the components of basic and diluted eps were as follows: \u00a0   \u00a0 62part ii item 8 \u00a0 anti-dilutive stock-based awards excluded from the calculations of diluted eps were immaterial during the periods presented. note 3 \u2014 other income (expense), net  the components of other income (expense), net were as follows:  \u00a0   following are details of net recognized gains (losses) on investments during the periods reported:  \u00a0   \u00a0 63part ii item 8 \u00a0 note 4 \u2014 investments investment components  the components of investments, including associated derivatives, were as follows:  \u00a0   \u00a0   \u00a0 as of june 30, 2017 and 2016, the recorded bases of common and preferred stock that are restricted for more than one year or are not publicly traded were $1.1 billion and $767 million, respectively. these investments are carried at cost and are reviewed quarterly for indicators of other-than-temporary impairment. it is not practicable for us to reliably estimate the fair value of these investments.  as of june 30, 2017, collateral received under agreements for loaned securities was $3.7 billion, which was primarily comprised of u.s. government and agency securities. as of june 30, 2016, collateral received under agreements for loaned securities was $294 million, which was primarily comprised of cash.  64part ii item 8 \u00a0 unrealized losses on investments  investments with continuous unrealized losses for less than 12 months and 12 months or greater and their related fair values were as follows:  \u00a0   \u00a0   \u00a0 unrealized losses from fixed-income securities are primarily attributable to changes in interest rates. unrealized losses from domestic and international equities are due to market price movements. management does not believe any remaining unrealized losses represent other-than-temporary impairments based on our evaluation of available evidence.  debt investment maturities  \u00a0   \u00a0 note 5 \u2014 derivatives  we use derivative instruments to manage risks related to foreign currencies, equity prices, interest rates, and credit; to enhance investment returns; and to facilitate portfolio diversification. our objectives for holding derivatives include reducing, eliminating, and efficiently managing the economic impact of these exposures as effectively as possible.  our derivative programs include strategies that both qualify and do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment. all notional amounts presented below are measured in u.s. dollar equivalents.  65part ii item 8 \u00a0 foreign currency  certain forecasted transactions, assets, and liabilities are exposed to foreign currency risk. we monitor our foreign currency exposures daily to maximize the economic effectiveness of our foreign currency hedge positions. option and forward contracts are used to hedge a portion of forecasted international revenue for up to three years in the future and are designated as cash flow hedging instruments. principal currencies hedged include the euro, japanese yen, british pound, canadian dollar, and australian dollar. as of june 30, 2017 and 2016, the total notional amounts of these foreign exchange contracts sold were $8.9 billion and $8.4 billion, respectively.  foreign currency risks related to certain non-u.s. dollar denominated securities are hedged using foreign exchange forward contracts that are designated as fair value hedging instruments. as of june 30, 2017 and 2016, the total notional amounts of these foreign exchange contracts sold were $5.1 billion and $5.3 billion, respectively.  certain options and forwards not designated as hedging instruments are also used to manage the variability in foreign exchange rates on certain balance sheet amounts and to manage other foreign currency exposures.\u00a0as of june 30, 2017, the total notional amounts of these foreign exchange contracts purchased and sold were $8.8 billion and $10.6 billion, respectively. as of june\u00a030, 2016, the total notional amounts of these foreign exchange contracts purchased and sold were $12.0 billion and $11.7 billion, respectively.  equity  securities held in our equity and other investments portfolio are subject to market price risk.\u00a0market price risk is managed relative to broad-based global and domestic equity indices using certain convertible preferred investments, options, futures, and swap contracts not designated as hedging instruments. from time to time, to hedge our price risk, we may use and designate equity derivatives as hedging instruments, including puts, calls, swaps, and forwards.\u00a0as of june 30, 2017, the total notional amounts of equity contracts purchased and sold for managing market price risk were $1.9 billion and $2.4 billion, respectively, of which $1.6 billion and $1.8 billion, respectively, were designated as hedging instruments. as of june\u00a030, 2016, the total notional amounts of equity contracts purchased and sold for managing market price risk were $1.3 billion and $2.2 billion, respectively, of which $737 million and $986 million, respectively, were designated as hedging instruments.  interest rate  securities held in our fixed-income portfolio are subject to different interest rate risks based on their maturities. we manage the average maturity of our fixed-income portfolio to achieve economic returns that correlate to certain broad-based fixed-income indices using exchange-traded option and futures contracts, and over-the-counter swap and option contracts, none of which are designated as hedging instruments. as of june 30, 2017, the total notional amounts of fixed-interest rate contracts purchased and sold were $233 million and $352 million, respectively. as of june\u00a030, 2016, the total notional amounts of fixed-interest rate contracts purchased and sold were $328 million and $2.4 billion, respectively.  in addition, we use \u201cto be announced\u201d forward purchase commitments of mortgage-backed assets to gain exposure to agency mortgage-backed securities.\u00a0these meet the definition of a derivative instrument in cases where physical delivery of the assets is not taken at the earliest available delivery date. as of june 30, 2017 and 2016, the total notional derivative amounts of mortgage contracts purchased were $567 million and $548 million, respectively.  credit  our fixed-income portfolio is diversified and consists primarily of investment-grade securities. we use credit default swap contracts, not designated as hedging instruments, to manage credit exposures relative to broad-based indices and to facilitate portfolio diversification. we use credit default swaps as they are a low-cost method of managing exposure to individual credit risks or groups of credit risks. as of june 30, 2017, the total notional amounts of credit contracts purchased and sold were $267 million and $63 million, respectively. as of june\u00a030, 2016, the total notional amounts of credit contracts purchased and sold were $440 million and $273 million, respectively.  66part ii item 8 \u00a0 commodity  we use broad-based commodity exposures to enhance portfolio returns and to facilitate portfolio diversification. we use swaps, futures, and option contracts, not designated as hedging instruments, to generate and manage exposures to broad-based commodity indices. we use derivatives on commodities as they can be low-cost alternatives to the purchase and storage of a variety of commodities, including, but not limited to, precious metals, energy, and grain. as of june 30, 2017, the total notional amounts of commodity contracts purchased were $19 million. as of june\u00a030, 2016, the total notional amounts of commodity contracts purchased and sold were $631 million and $162 million, respectively.  credit-risk-related contingent features  certain of our counterparty agreements for derivative instruments contain provisions that require our issued and outstanding long-term unsecured debt to maintain an investment grade credit rating and require us to maintain minimum liquidity of $1.0 billion. to the extent we fail to meet these requirements, we will be required to post collateral, similar to the standard convention related to over-the-counter derivatives. as of june 30, 2017, our long-term unsecured debt rating was aaa, and cash investments were in excess of $1.0 billion. as a result, no collateral was required to be posted.  67part ii item 8 \u00a0 fair values of derivative instruments  the following table presents the fair values of derivative instruments designated as hedging instruments (\u201cdesignated hedge derivatives\u201d) and not designated as hedging instruments (\u201cnon-designated hedge derivatives\u201d). the fair values exclude the impact of netting derivative assets and liabilities when a legally enforceable master netting agreement exists and fair value adjustments related to our own credit risk and counterparty credit risk:  \u00a0   \u00a0 see also note 4 \u2013 investments and note\u00a06\u00a0\u2013 fair value measurements.  \u00a0 68part ii item 8 \u00a0 fair value hedge gains (losses)  we recognized in other income (expense), net the following gains (losses) on contracts designated as fair value hedges and their related hedged items: \u00a0   \u00a0 cash flow hedge gains (losses)  we recognized the following gains (losses) on foreign exchange contracts designated as cash flow hedges:  \u00a0   \u00a0 we estimate that $130 million of net derivative gains included in aoci as of june 30, 2017 will be reclassified into earnings within the following 12 months. no significant amounts of gains (losses) were reclassified from aoci into earnings as a result of forecasted transactions that failed to occur during fiscal year 2017.  69part ii item 8 \u00a0 non-designated derivative gains (losses)  gains (losses) from changes in fair values of derivatives that are not designated as hedges are primarily recognized in other income (expense), net. these amounts are shown in the table below, with the exception of gains (losses) on derivatives presented in income statement line items other than other income (expense), net, which were immaterial for the periods presented. other than those derivatives entered into for investment purposes, such as commodity contracts, the gains (losses) below are generally economically offset by unrealized gains (losses) in the underlying available-for-sale securities and gains (losses) from foreign exchange rate changes on certain balance sheet amounts.  \u00a0   \u00a0 \u00a0 note 6 \u2014 fair value measurements  financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis  the following tables present the fair value of our financial instruments that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis:  \u00a0   70part ii item 8 \u00a0 \u00a0   \u00a0   the changes in our level 3 financial instruments that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis were immaterial during the periods presented.  the following table reconciles the total \u201cnet fair value\u201d of assets above to the balance sheet presentation of these same assets in note 4 \u2013 investments.  \u00a0   \u00a0 financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis  during fiscal year 2017 and 2016, we did not record any material other-than-temporary impairments on financial assets required to be measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis.  71part ii item 8 \u00a0 note 7 \u2014 inventories  the components of inventories were as follows:  \u00a0   \u00a0 note 8 \u2014 property and equipment  the components of property and equipment were as follows:  \u00a0   \u00a0 as of june 30, 2017 and 2016, assets recorded under capital leases were $2.7 billion and $865 million, respectively, and accumulated depreciation associated with capital leases was $161 million and $57 million, respectively. during fiscal years 2017 and 2016, property and equipment acquired under capital leases was $1.8 billion and $413 million, respectively.  during fiscal years 2017, 2016, and 2015, depreciation expense was $6.1 billion, $4.9 billion, and $4.1 billion, respectively.  \u00a0 note 9 \u2014 business combinations  on december 8, 2016, we completed our acquisition of all issued and outstanding shares of linkedin corporation, the world\u2019s largest professional network on the internet, for a total purchase price of $27.0 billion. the purchase price consisted primarily of cash of $26.9 billion. the acquisition is expected to accelerate the growth of linkedin, office 365, and dynamics 365. the financial results of linkedin have been included in our consolidated financial statements since the date of the acquisition. 72part ii item 8 \u00a0 the allocation of the purchase price to goodwill was completed as of june 30, 2017. the major classes of assets and liabilities to which we allocated the purchase price were as follows:\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0       following are the details of the purchase price allocated to the intangible assets acquired:  \u00a0   our consolidated income statement includes the following revenue and operating loss attributable to linkedin since the date of acquisition: \u00a0   following are the supplemental consolidated financial results of microsoft corporation on an unaudited pro forma basis, as if the acquisition had been consummated on july\u00a01, 2015:  \u00a0   \u00a0 73part ii item 8 \u00a0 these pro forma results were based on estimates and assumptions, which we believe are reasonable. they are not the results that would have been realized had we been a combined company during the periods presented and are not necessarily indicative of our consolidated results of operations in future periods. the pro forma results include adjustments related to purchase accounting, primarily amortization of intangible assets. acquisition costs and other nonrecurring charges were immaterial and are included in the earliest period presented.  note 10 \u2014 goodwill  changes in the carrying amount of goodwill were as follows:  \u00a0   \u00a0   the measurement periods for the valuation of assets acquired and liabilities assumed end as soon as information on the facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition dates becomes available, but do not exceed 12 months. adjustments in purchase price allocations may require a change in the amounts allocated to goodwill during the periods in which the adjustments are determined.  any change in the goodwill amounts resulting from foreign currency translations and purchase accounting adjustments are presented as \u201cother\u201d in the above table. also included in \u201cother\u201d are business dispositions and transfers between business segments due to reorganizations, as applicable.  our accumulated goodwill impairment as of both june 30, 2017 and 2016 was $11.3 billion. goodwill impairment\u00a0\u00a0 we test goodwill for impairment annually on may\u00a01 at the reporting unit level, primarily using a discounted cash flow methodology with a peer-based, risk-adjusted weighted average cost of capital. we believe use of a discounted cash flow approach is the most reliable indicator of the fair values of the businesses. effective may 1, 2017, we prospectively adopted accounting guidance that simplifies our goodwill impairment testing by eliminating the requirement to calculate the implied fair value of goodwill (formerly \u201cstep 2\u201d) in the event that an impairment is identified. instead, an impairment charge is recorded based on the excess of the reporting unit\u2019s carrying amount over its fair value. no instances of impairment were identified in our may 1, 2017 or may 1, 2016 test. during fiscal year 2015, we recorded impairment charges of $5.1 billion related to goodwill in our previous phone hardware reporting unit. phone hardware goodwill is included in the devices reporting unit within more personal computing under our current segment structure.  upon completion of the annual testing as of may 1, 2015, our previous phone hardware reporting unit goodwill was determined to be impaired. in the second half of fiscal year 2015, phone hardware did not meet its sales volume and revenue goals, and the mix of units sold had lower margins than planned. these results, along with changes in the competitive marketplace and an evaluation of business priorities, led to a shift in strategic direction and reduced future revenue and profitability expectations for the business. as a result of these changes in strategy and expectations, we forecasted reductions in unit volume growth rates and lower future cash flows used to estimate the fair value of the phone hardware reporting unit, which resulted in the determination that an impairment adjustment was required. 74part ii item 8 \u00a0 because our annual test indicated that phone hardware\u2019s carrying value exceeded its estimated fair value, step 2 of the goodwill impairment test was performed specific to phone hardware. under step 2, the fair value of all phone hardware assets and liabilities were estimated, including tangible assets, existing technology, patent agreements, and contractual arrangements, for the purpose of deriving an estimate of the implied fair value of goodwill. the implied fair value of the goodwill was then compared to the recorded goodwill to determine the amount of the impairment. assumptions used in measuring the value of these assets and liabilities included the discount rates and royalty rates used in valuing the intangible assets, and consideration of the market environment in valuing the tangible assets. note 11 \u2014 intangible assets  the components of intangible assets, all of which are finite-lived, were as follows:  \u00a0   \u00a0     no material impairments of intangible assets were identified during fiscal year 2017. during fiscal year 2016, we recorded impairment charges of $480 million related to intangible assets in the devices reporting unit within our more personal computing segment. in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016, we tested these intangible assets for recoverability due to changes in facts and circumstances associated with the shift in strategic direction and reduced profitability expectations for our phone business. based on the results of our testing, we determined that the carrying value of the intangible assets was not recoverable, and an impairment charge was recorded to the extent that estimated fair value exceeded carrying value. we primarily used the income approach to determine the fair value of the intangible assets and determine the amount of impairment.  during fiscal year 2015, we recorded impairment charges of $2.2 billion related to intangible assets in our previous phone hardware reporting unit. phone hardware intangible assets are included in the devices reporting unit under our current segment structure. in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2015, we tested these intangible assets for recoverability due to changes in facts and circumstances associated with the shift in strategic direction and reduced profitability expectations for phone hardware. based on the results of our testing, we determined that the carrying value of the intangible assets was not recoverable, and an impairment charge was recorded to the extent that estimated fair value exceeded carrying value. we primarily used a relief from royalty income approach to determine the fair value of the intangible assets and determine the amount of impairment. these intangible assets impairment charges were included in impairment, integration, and restructuring expenses on our consolidated income statement, and reflected in corporate and other in our table of operating income (loss) by segment in note 21 \u2013 segment information and geographic data.  we estimate that we have no significant residual value related to our intangible assets.  75part ii item 8 \u00a0 the components of intangible assets acquired during the periods presented were as follows:  \u00a0   \u00a0 intangible assets amortization expense was $1.7 billion, $978 million, and $1.3 billion for fiscal years 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively. amortization of capitalized software was $55 million, $69 million, and $79 million for fiscal years 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively.  the following table outlines the estimated future amortization expense related to intangible assets held as of june 30, 2017:  \u00a0   \u00a0 note 12 \u2014 debt  short-term debt as of june 30, 2017, we had $9.1 billion of commercial paper issued and outstanding, with a weighted-average interest rate of 1.01% and maturities ranging from 25 days to 264 days. as of june\u00a030, 2016, we had $12.9 billion of commercial paper issued and outstanding, with a weighted-average interest rate of 0.43% and maturities ranging from 1 day to 99 days. the estimated fair value of this commercial paper approximates its carrying value. we have two $5.0 billion credit facilities that expire on october 31, 2017 and november 14, 2018, respectively. these credit facilities serve as a back-up for our commercial paper program. as of june 30, 2017, we were in compliance with the only financial covenant in both credit agreements, which requires us to maintain a coverage ratio of at least three times earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization to interest expense, as defined in the credit agreements. no amounts were drawn against these credit facilities during any of the periods presented.  long-term debt as of june 30, 2017, the total carrying value and estimated fair value of our long-term debt, including the current portion, were $77.1 billion and $80.3 billion, respectively. as of june 30, 2016, the total carrying value and estimated fair value of our long-term debt were $40.6 billion and $44.0 billion, respectively. these estimated fair values are based on level 2 inputs.  76part ii item 8 \u00a0 the components of our long-term debt, including the current portion, and the associated interest rates were as follows:  \u00a0   \u00a0   77part ii item 8 \u00a0         the notes in the table above are senior unsecured obligations and rank equally with our other senior unsecured debt outstanding. interest on these notes is paid semi-annually, except for the euro-denominated debt securities on which interest is paid annually. cash paid for interest on our debt for fiscal years 2017, 2016, and 2015 was $1.6 billion, $1.1 billion, and $620 million, respectively. effective july 1, 2016, we retrospectively adopted accounting guidance that requires debt issuance costs to be recorded as a deduction from the carrying amount of the debt liability, consistent with debt discounts. as of june 30, 2017 and 2016, the aggregate unamortized discount and debt issuance costs associated with our long-term debt, including the current portion, were $715 million and $392 million, respectively.  maturities of our long-term debt for each of the next five years and thereafter are as follows:  \u00a0   \u00a0 note 13 \u2014 income taxes  the components of the provision for income taxes were as follows:  \u00a0   \u00a0 78part ii item 8 \u00a0 in fiscal year 2017, deferred taxes included u.s. and foreign deferred tax benefit of $2.7 billion and $617 million, respectively. \u00a0 u.s. and foreign components of income (loss) before income taxes were as follows:  \u00a0   \u00a0 in fiscal year 2017, income before income taxes included the net impact of u.s. and foreign revenue deferrals related to the sales of windows 10 of $6.4 billion and $317 million, respectively. in fiscal year 2016, income before income taxes included the net impact of u.s. and foreign revenue deferrals related to the sales of windows 10 of $6.0 billion and $588 million, respectively. in fiscal year 2015, income before income taxes included the net impact of u.s. and foreign impairment, integration, and restructuring expenses relating to our phone business of $1.1 billion and $8.9 billion, respectively. the items accounting for the difference between income taxes computed at the u.s. federal statutory rate and our effective rate were as follows:  \u00a0   \u00a0 the reduction from the federal statutory rate is primarily due to earnings taxed at lower rates in foreign jurisdictions resulting from producing and distributing our products and services through our foreign regional operations centers in ireland, singapore, and puerto rico. our foreign regional operating centers, which are taxed at rates lower than the u.s. rate, generated 64%, 69%, and 73% of our foreign income before tax in fiscal years 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively. additionally, our effective tax rate in fiscal year 2017 reflects the realization of tax benefits attributable to previous phone business losses. in general, other reconciling items consist primarily of u.s. state income taxes, permanent items, and credits. in fiscal years 2017, 2016, and 2015, there were no individually significant other reconciling items. the decrease in our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2017 compared to fiscal year 2016 was primarily due to the realization of tax benefits attributable to previous phone business losses, offset in part by changes in the mix of our income before income taxes between the u.s. and foreign countries. the fiscal year 2016 effective tax rate included the impact of nondeductible phone charges and valuation allowances.  79part ii item 8 \u00a0 the components of the deferred income tax assets and liabilities were as follows: \u00a0 \u00a0   \u00a0 in fiscal year 2017, we corrected the table above to include a $2.5 billion loss carryforward and valuation allowance as of june 30, 2016. we do not consider this correction to be material, and there was no impact to our consolidated financial statements. as of june 30, 2017, we had net operating loss carryforwards of $13.7 billion, including $11.1 billion of foreign net operating loss carryforwards. the valuation allowance disclosed in the table above relates to the foreign net operating loss carryforwards and other net deferred tax assets that may not be realized.  deferred income tax balances reflect the effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases and are stated at enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when the taxes are paid or recovered.  as of june 30, 2017, we have not provided deferred u.s. income taxes or foreign withholding taxes on temporary differences of approximately $142 billion resulting from earnings for certain non-u.s. subsidiaries which are permanently reinvested outside the u.s. the unrecognized deferred tax liability associated with these temporary differences was approximately $45 billion as of june 30, 2017.  income taxes paid, net of refunds, were $2.4 billion, $3.9 billion, and $4.4 billion in fiscal years 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively.  80part ii item 8 \u00a0 tax contingencies and other income tax liabilities were $13.5 billion and $11.8 billion as of june 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively, and are included in other long-term liabilities. this increase relates primarily to current period intercompany transfer pricing and tax credits. uncertain tax positions  unrecognized tax benefits as of june 30, 2017, 2016, and 2015, were $11.7 billion, $10.2 billion, and $9.6 billion, respectively. if recognized, these tax benefits would affect our effective tax rates for fiscal years 2017, 2016, and 2015, by $10.2 billion, $8.8 billion, and $7.9 billion, respectively. as of june 30, 2017, 2016, and 2015, we had accrued interest expense related to uncertain tax positions of $2.3 billion, $1.9 billion, and $1.7 billion, respectively, net of federal income tax benefits. interest expense on unrecognized tax benefits was $399 million, $163 million, and $237 million in fiscal years 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively, and was included in provision for income taxes. the aggregate changes in the balance of unrecognized tax benefits were as follows:  \u00a0   \u00a0 while we settled a portion of the internal revenue service (\u201cirs\u201d) audit for tax years 2004 to 2006 during the third quarter of fiscal year 2011, and settled a portion of the irs audit for tax years 2007 to 2009 during the first quarter of fiscal year 2016, we remain under audit for those years. we also continue to be subject to examination by the irs for tax years 2010 to 2016. in february 2012, the irs withdrew its 2011 revenue agents report for tax years 2004 to 2006 and reopened the audit phase of the examination. as of june 30, 2017, the primary unresolved issue relates to transfer pricing, which could have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements if not resolved favorably. we believe our allowances for income tax contingencies are adequate. we have not received a proposed assessment for the unresolved issues and do not expect a final resolution of these issues in the next 12 months.\u00a0based on the information currently available, we do not anticipate a significant increase or decrease to our tax contingencies for these issues within the next 12 months.  we are subject to income tax in many jurisdictions outside the u.s. our operations in certain jurisdictions remain subject to examination for tax years 1996 to 2017, some of which are currently under audit by local tax authorities. the resolutions of these audits are not expected to be material to our consolidated financial statements.  note 14 \u2014 restructuring charges  phone hardware restructuring  in june 2015, management approved a plan to restructure our phone business to better focus and align resources (the \u201cphone hardware restructuring plan\u201d), under which we eliminated approximately 7,400 positions in fiscal year 2016. in fiscal year 2015, we incurred restructuring charges of $780 million under the phone hardware restructuring plan, including severance expenses and other reorganization costs. in fiscal year 2016, we reversed $21 million of previously estimated restructuring charges related to contract termination costs. the actions associated with the phone hardware restructuring plan were completed as of june\u00a030, 2017.  81part ii item 8 \u00a0 2016 restructuring  in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016, management approved restructuring plans that resulted in approximately 4,700 job eliminations in fiscal year 2017, primarily across our smartphone hardware business and global sales.\u00a0\u00a0 in fiscal year 2016, we incurred restructuring charges of $501 million in connection with the 2016 restructuring plans, including severance expenses and other reorganization costs. the actions associated with these restructuring plans were completed as of june 30, 2017. 2017 restructuring  in june 2017, management approved a sales and marketing restructuring plan. in fiscal year 2017, we recorded employee severance expenses of $306 million primarily related to this sales and marketing restructuring plan. we do not expect to incur additional charges for this restructuring plan in subsequent years. the actions associated with this restructuring plan are expected to be completed by the end of fiscal year 2018. restructuring summary restructuring charges associated with each of these plans were included in impairment, integration, and restructuring expenses on our consolidated income statements, and were reflected in corporate and other in our table of operating income (loss) by segment.  changes in the restructuring liability were as follows:  \u00a0     note 15 \u2014 unearned revenue  unearned revenue by segment was as follows:  \u00a0   \u00a0 corporate and other consists of the net revenue deferral from windows 10. revenue from windows 10 is primarily recognized at the time of billing in the more personal computing segment, and the deferral and subsequent recognition of revenue is reflected in corporate and other.  82part ii item 8 \u00a0 note 16 \u2014 commitments construction and operating leases  we have committed $1.1 billion for constructing new buildings, building improvements, and leasehold improvements as of june 30, 2017.  we have operating leases for most u.s. and international sales and support offices, datacenters, research and development facilities, manufacturing facilities, retail stores, and certain equipment. rental expense for facilities operating leases was $1.3 billion, $1.0 billion, and $989 million, in fiscal years 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively. future minimum rental commitments under non-cancellable facilities operating leases in place as of june 30, 2017 are as follows:  \u00a0   \u00a0 capital leases  we have capital leases for datacenters and corporate offices. as of june 30, 2017 and 2016, capital lease obligations included in other current liabilities were $113 million and $25 million, respectively, and capital lease obligations included in other long-term liabilities were $2.4 billion and $761 million, respectively.  future minimum lease payments under non-cancellable capital leases as of june 30, 2017 were as follows:  \u00a0   \u00a0   as of june 30, 2017, we had additional purchase obligations for capital leases executed but not yet recorded of $3.2 billion. 83part ii item 8 \u00a0 note 17 \u2014 contingencies  patent and intellectual property claims  ipcom patent litigation  ipcom gmbh\u00a0& co. (\u201cipcom\u201d) is a german company that holds a large portfolio of mobile technology-related patents spanning about 170 patent families and addressing a broad range of cellular technologies. ipcom has asserted 19 of these patents in litigation against nokia corporation (\u201cnokia\u201d) and many of the leading cell phone companies and operators. in november 2014, microsoft and ipcom entered into a standstill agreement staying all of the pending litigation against microsoft to permit the parties to pursue settlement discussions, which continue.  interdigital patent litigation  interdigital technology corporation and interdigital communications corporation (collectively, \u201cidt\u201d) filed four patent infringement cases against nokia in the international trade commission (\u201citc\u201d) and in u.s. district court for the district of delaware between 2007 and 2013. we were added to these cases as a defendant after we acquired the nokia phone business. each of the itc matters was resolved in our favor. in september 2015, in an inter partes review the united states patent trial and appeal board issued a final written decision that deemed unpatentable all asserted claims of the patent remaining at issue in the delaware case. idt\u2019s appeal of this decision was heard by the u.s. court of appeals for the federal circuit on april 7, 2017 and the delaware case was stayed pending final completion of the inter partes review (including appeals and any subsequent proceedings in the patent office). we filed an antitrust complaint against idt in the district of delaware in august 2015 asserting violations of section\u00a02 of the sherman act, alleging unlawful exploitation of standard essential patents. microsoft and idt settled these cases in may 2017 and they have been dismissed.  european copyright levies  we assumed from nokia all potential liability due to nokia\u2019s alleged failure to pay \u201cprivate copyright levies\u201d in various european countries based upon sale of memory cards and mobile phones that incorporate blank memory.\u00a0the levies are based upon a 2001 european union (\u201ceu\u201d) directive establishing a right for end users to make copies of copyrighted works for personal or private use, but also allowing the collection of levies based upon sales of blank media or recording devices to compensate copyright holders for private copying.\u00a0various collecting societies in eu countries initiated litigation against nokia, stating it must pay levies not only based upon sales of blank memory cards, but also phones that include blank memory for data storage on the phones, regardless of actual usage of that memory.\u00a0the most significant cases against nokia were pending in germany and austria, due to both the high volume of sales and high levy amounts sought in these countries. we reached a settlement of the austrian case in august 2016. in germany, the only period for which settlement has not been reached is 2004 through 2007. in july 2016, the german supreme court heard our appeal contesting the legality of the levy assessed on phones with music players and over five megabytes of memory. the supreme court issued a ruling in december 2016, finding that the levy may not be appropriate for phones that have the ability to receive music files only via bluetooth or infrared inputs, and remanded for further proceedings. a new case schedule has not been set, and we have reached a tentative settlement.\u00a0\u00a0 other patent and intellectual property claims  in addition to the ipcom cases, there were 41 other patent infringement cases pending against microsoft as of june 30, 2017.  antitrust, unfair competition, and overcharge class actions  antitrust and unfair competition class action lawsuits were filed against us in british columbia, ontario, and quebec, canada. all three have been certified on behalf of canadian indirect purchasers who acquired licenses for microsoft operating system software and/or productivity application software between 1998 and 2010.  the trial of the british columbia action commenced in may 2016. the plaintiffs filed their case in chief in august 2016, setting out claims made, authorities, and evidence in support of their claims.\u00a0a six-month oral hearing is scheduled to commence in september 2017, consisting of cross examination on witness affidavits. the ontario and quebec cases are inactive.  84part ii item 8 \u00a0 other antitrust litigation and claims  china state administration for industry and commerce investigation  in 2014, microsoft was informed that china\u2019s state administration for industry and commerce (\u201csaic\u201d) had begun a formal investigation relating to china\u2019s anti-monopoly law, and the saic conducted onsite inspections of microsoft offices in beijing, shanghai, guangzhou, and chengdu.\u00a0saic has stated the investigation relates to compatibility, bundle sales, file verification issues related to windows and office software, and potentially other issues.  product-related litigation  u.s. cell phone litigation  nokia, along with other handset manufacturers and network operators, is a defendant in 19 lawsuits filed in the superior court for the district of columbia by individual plaintiffs who allege that radio emissions from cellular handsets caused their brain tumors and other adverse health effects. we assumed responsibility for these claims as part of our acquisition of nokia\u2019s devices and services business and have been substituted for the nokia defendants. nine of these cases were filed in 2002 and are consolidated for certain pre-trial proceedings; the remaining 10 cases are stayed. in a separate 2009 decision, the court of appeals for the district of columbia held that adverse health effect claims arising from the use of cellular handsets that operate within the u.s. federal communications commission radio frequency emission guidelines (\u201cfcc guidelines\u201d) are pre-empted by federal law. the plaintiffs allege that their handsets either operated outside the fcc guidelines or were manufactured before the fcc guidelines went into effect. the lawsuits also allege an industry-wide conspiracy to manipulate the science and testing around emission guidelines.  in 2013, defendants in the consolidated cases moved to exclude plaintiffs\u2019 expert evidence of general causation on the basis of flawed scientific methodologies. in 2014, the trial court granted in part and denied in part defendants\u2019 motion to exclude plaintiffs\u2019 general causation experts. the defendants filed an interlocutory appeal challenging the standard for evaluating expert scientific evidence, which the district of columbia court of appeals heard en banc. in october 2016, the court of appeals issued its decision adopting the standard advocated by defendants and remanding the cases to the trial court for further proceedings under that standard. plaintiffs have filed a motion to reopen discovery and file additional expert evidence.  canadian cell phone class action  nokia, along with other handset manufacturers and network operators, is a defendant in a 2013 class action lawsuit filed in the supreme court of british columbia by a purported class of canadians who have used cellular phones for at least 1,600 hours, including a subclass of users with brain tumors. microsoft was served with the complaint in june 2014 and has been substituted for the nokia defendants. the litigation has been dormant for more than two years.  other contingencies  we also are subject to a variety of other claims and suits that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of our business. although management currently believes that resolving claims against us, individually or in aggregate, will not have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements, these matters are subject to inherent uncertainties and management\u2019s view of these matters may change in the future.  as of june 30, 2017, we accrued aggregate legal liabilities of $352 million. while we intend to defend these matters vigorously, adverse outcomes that we estimate could reach approximately $1.0 billion in aggregate beyond recorded amounts are reasonably possible. were unfavorable final outcomes to occur, there exists the possibility of a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements for the period in which the effects become reasonably estimable.  85part ii item 8 \u00a0 indemnifications  we provide indemnifications of varying scope and size to certain customers against claims of intellectual property infringement made by third parties arising from the use of our products and certain other matters. additionally, we have agreed to cover damages resulting from breaches of certain security and privacy commitments in our cloud business. we evaluate estimated losses for these indemnifications, and we consider such factors as the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss. to date, we have not encountered significant costs as a result of these obligations and have not accrued any liabilities related to these indemnifications on our consolidated financial statements.  note 18 \u2014

executive officer, reviews certain financial information, including segmented internal profit and loss statements prepared on a basis not consistent with u.s. gaap. during the periods presented, we reported our financial performance based on the following segments: productivity and business processes, intelligent cloud, and more personal computing. in december 2016, we completed our acquisition of linkedin corporation. linkedin is reported as part of our productivity and business processes segment.  our reportable segments are described below.  productivity and business processes  our productivity and business processes segment consists of products and services in our portfolio of productivity, communication, and information services, spanning a variety of devices and platforms.

policies to u.s. gaap, and impairment, integration, and restructuring expenses. significant internal accounting policies that differ from u.s. gaap relate to windows 10 revenue recognition.  revenue and costs are generally directly attributed to our segments. however, due to the integrated structure of our business, certain revenue recognized and costs incurred by one segment may benefit other segments. revenue on certain contracts is allocated among the segments based on the relative value of the underlying products and services, which can include allocation based on actual prices charged, prices when sold separately, or estimated costs plus a profit margin. cost of revenue is allocated in certain cases based on a relative revenue methodology. operating expenses that are allocated primarily include those relating to marketing of products and services from which multiple segments benefit, and are generally allocated based on relative gross margin.  in addition, certain costs incurred at a corporate level that are identifiable and that benefit our segments are allocated to them. these allocated costs include costs of: legal, including settlements, and fines; information technology; human resources; finance; excise taxes; field selling; shared facilities services; and customer service and support. each allocation is measured differently based on the specific facts and circumstances of the costs being allocated. certain corporate-level activity is not allocated to our segments, including impairment, integration, and restructuring expenses.  segment revenue and

responsibility of the company\u2019s management. our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.  we conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board (united states).\u00a0those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.\u00a0an audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.\u00a0an audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. we believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.  in our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of microsoft corporation and subsidiaries as

executive officer and chief financial officer have concluded that these disclosure controls and procedures are effective.  report of management on internal control over financial reporting  our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for the company. internal control over financial reporting is a process to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america. internal control over financial reporting includes maintaining records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect our transactions; providing reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary for preparation of our financial statements; providing reasonable assurance that receipts and expenditures of company assets are made in accordance with management authorization; and providing reasonable assurance that unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of company assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements would be prevented or detected on a timely basis. because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting is not intended to provide absolute assurance that a misstatement of our financial statements would be prevented or detected.  management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in internal control \u2013 integrated framework (2013)\u00a0issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission. based on this evaluation, management concluded that the company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of june 30, 2017. deloitte\u00a0& touche llp has audited our internal control over financial reporting as of june 30, 2017; their report is included in item\u00a09a.  there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended june 30, 2017 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. during fiscal year 2017, we implemented internal controls to ensure we have adequately evaluated our contracts and properly assessed the impact of the new accounting standards related to revenue recognition and leases on our financial statements to facilitate the adoption on july 1, 2017. we do not expect significant changes to our internal control over financial reporting due to the adoption of the new standards. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 95part ii item 9a \u00a0 report of independent registered public accounting firm  to the board of directors and stockholders of microsoft corporation  redmond, washington  we have audited the internal control over financial reporting of microsoft corporation and subsidiaries (the \u201ccompany\u201d) as of june 30, 2017, based on criteria established in internal control \u2013 integrated framework (2013)\u00a0issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission.\u00a0the company\u2019s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying report of management on internal control over financial reporting.\u00a0our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.  we conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board (united states).\u00a0those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\u00a0our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.\u00a0we believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.  a company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company\u2019s principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the company\u2019s board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.\u00a0a company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1)\u00a0pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2)\u00a0provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3)\u00a0provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company\u2019s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.  because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.\u00a0also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.  in our opinion, the company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of june 30, 2017, based on the criteria established in internal control \u2013 integrated framework (2013)\u00a0issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission.  we have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board (united states), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended june 30, 2017 of the company and our report dated august 2, 2017 expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.

compete with us based on a growing variety of business models.  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 the competitive pressures described above may result in decreased sales volumes, price reductions, and/or increased operating costs, such as for marketing and sales incentives. this may lead to lower revenue, gross margins, and operating income.  our increasing focus on services presents execution and competitive risks.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0a growing part of our strategy involves cloud-based services used with smart devices. our competitors are rapidly developing and deploying cloud-based services for consumers and business customers. pricing and delivery models are evolving. devices and form factors influence how users access services in the cloud and in some cases the user\u0092s choice of which suite of cloud-based services to use. we are devoting significant resources to develop and deploy our own competing cloud-based strategies. the windows ecosystem must continue to evolve with this changing environment. while we believe our expertise, investments in infrastructure, and the breadth of our cloud-based services provide us with a strong foundation to compete, it is uncertain whether our strategies will attract the users or generate the revenue required to be successful. in addition to software development costs, we are incurring costs to build and maintain infrastructure to support cloud computing services. these costs may reduce the operating margins we have previously achieved. whether we are successful in this new business model depends on our execution in a number of areas, including:  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 in july 2013, we announced a change in organizational structure as part of our transformation to a devices and services company. this change in structure is designed to enable us to innovate with greater speed, efficiency, and capability in the fast-changing competitive environment. we expect this change to alter the way we plan, develop, and market our products and services, as we pursue a single strategy to offer a family of devices and services designed to empower our customers for the activities they value most. it is uncertain whether our \u0093one microsoft\u0094 strategy will yield the anticipated efficiencies or competitive benefits.  as we increasingly license cloud-based versions of our products and services, such as office 365, rather than licensing transaction-based products and services, the associated revenue will shift from being recognized at the time of the transaction to being recognized over the period of the subscription.  \u00a0 15  table of contents  \u00a0 part i  item 1a  \u00a0 we make significant investments in new products and services that may not be profitable.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0we will continue to make significant investments in research, development, and marketing for existing products, services, and technologies, including the windows operating system, the microsoft office system, bing, windows phone, windows server, the windows store, the windows azure services platform, office 365, other cloud-based services offerings, and the xbox 360 entertainment platform. we will continue to invest in new software and hardware products, services, and technologies, such as the microsoft-designed and manufactured surface launched in october 2012. investments in new technology are speculative. commercial success depends on many factors, including innovativeness, developer support, and effective distribution and marketing. if customers do not perceive our latest offerings as providing significant new functionality or other value, they may reduce their purchases of new software products or upgrades, unfavorably impacting revenue. we may not achieve significant revenue from new product, service, and distribution channel investments for a number of years, if at all. moreover, new products and services may not be profitable, and even if they are profitable, operating margins for some new products and businesses will not be as high as the margins we have experienced historically.  in october 2012, we launched windows\u00a08, a major new release of our operating system, which seeks to deliver a unique user experience through well-integrated software, hardware, and services. its success depends on a number of factors including the extent to which customers embrace the new user interface and functionality, successfully coordinating with our oem partners in releasing a variety of hardware devices that take advantage of new features, pricing windows 8-based devices competitively, and attracting developers at scale to ensure a competitive array of quality applications. the marketing costs we are incurring to promote windows 8 and associated services and devices may reduce our operating margins.  acquisitions, joint ventures, and strategic alliances may have an adverse effect on our business.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0we expect to continue making acquisitions or entering into joint ventures and strategic alliances as part of our long-term business strategy. these transactions involve significant challenges and risks including that the transaction does not advance our business strategy, that we do not realize a satisfactory return on our investment, that we experience difficulty integrating new employees, business systems, and technology, or that the transaction diverts management\u0092s attention from our other businesses. our acquisition of skype, for example, provides opportunities to enhance our existing products. the success of this acquisition will depend in part on our ability to provide compelling experiences that distinguish us from our competitors in both consumer and business markets. it may take longer than expected to realize the full benefits from these transactions, such as increased revenue, enhanced efficiencies, or increased market share, or the benefits may ultimately be smaller than anticipated or may not be realized. these events could harm our operating results or financial condition.  we may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property rights.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0protecting our global intellectual property rights and combating unlicensed copying and use of our software and other intellectual property is difficult. while piracy adversely affects u.s. revenue, the impact on revenue from outside the u.s. is more significant, particularly in countries where laws are less protective of intellectual property rights. as a result, our revenue in these markets may grow slower than the underlying pc market. similarly, the absence of harmonized patent laws makes it more difficult to ensure consistent respect for patent rights. throughout the world, we actively educate consumers about the benefits of licensing genuine products and obtaining indemnification benefits for intellectual property risks, and we educate lawmakers about the advantages of a business climate where intellectual property rights are protected. however, continued educational and enforcement efforts may fail to enhance revenue. reductions in the legal protection for software intellectual property rights could adversely affect revenue.  third parties may claim we infringe their intellectual property rights.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0from time to time, we receive notices from others claiming we infringe their intellectual property rights. the number of these claims may grow because of constant technological change in the segments in which we compete, the extensive patent coverage of existing technologies, the rapid rate of issuance of new patents, and our offering of microsoft-branded services and hardware devices, such as surface. to resolve these claims we may enter into royalty and licensing agreements on terms that are less favorable than currently available, stop selling or redesign affected products or services, or pay damages to satisfy indemnification commitments with our customers. these outcomes may cause operating margins to decline. in addition to money damages, in some jurisdictions plaintiffs can seek injunctive relief that may limit or prevent importing, marketing, and selling our products or services that have infringing technologies. in some countries, such  \u00a0 16  table of contents  \u00a0 part i  item 1a  \u00a0  as germany, an injunction can be issued before the parties have fully litigated the validity of the underlying patents. we have made and expect to continue making significant expenditures to settle claims related to the use of technology and intellectual property rights and to procure intellectual property rights as part of our strategy to manage this risk.  we may not be able to protect our source code from copying if there is an unauthorized disclosure of source code.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0source code, the detailed program commands for our operating systems and other software programs, is critical to our business. although we license portions of our application and operating system source code to a number of licensees, we take significant measures to protect the secrecy of large portions of our source code. if an unauthorized disclosure of a significant portion of our source code occurs, we could potentially lose future trade secret protection for that source code. it may become easier for third parties to compete with our products by copying functionality, which could adversely affect our revenue and operating margins. unauthorized disclosure of source code also could increase the security risks described in the next paragraph.  cyber-attacks and security vulnerabilities could lead to reduced revenue, increased costs, liability claims, or harm to our competitive position.  security of microsoft\u0092s information technology  maintaining the security of computers and computer networks is paramount for us and our customers. threats to information technology (\u0093it\u0094) security can take a variety of forms. hackers develop and deploy viruses, worms, and other malicious software programs that attack our products and services and gain access to our networks and data centers. groups of hackers may also act in a coordinated manner to launch distributed denial of service attacks, or other coordinated attacks. sophisticated organizations, individuals, or governments launch targeted attacks to gain access to our network. breaches of our network or data security could disrupt and compromise the security of our internal systems and business applications, impair our ability to provide services to our customers and protect the privacy of their data, result in product development delays, compromise confidential or technical business information harming our competitive position, result in theft or misuse of our intellectual property, or otherwise adversely affect our business.  in addition, our internal it environment continues to evolve. often we are early adopters of new devices and technologies. we embrace new ways of sharing data and communicating internally and with partners and customers using methods such as social networking and other consumer-oriented technologies. these practices can enhance efficiency and business insight, but they also present risks that our business policies and internal security controls may not keep pace with the speed of these changes.  security of our customers\u0092 products and services  security threats are a particular challenge to companies like us whose business is technology products and services. the threats to our own it infrastructure also affect our customers. customers using our cloud-based services rely on the security of our infrastructure to ensure the reliability of our services and the protection of their data. hackers tend to focus their efforts on the most popular operating systems, programs, and services, including many of ours, and we expect them to continue to do so. the security of our products and services is an important consideration in our customers\u0092 purchasing decisions.  we devote significant resources to defend against security threats, both to our internal it systems and those of our customers. these include:  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 17  table of contents  \u00a0 part i  item 1a  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 the cost of these steps could reduce our operating margins. despite these efforts, actual or perceived security vulnerabilities in our products and services could cause significant reputational harm and lead some customers to reduce or delay future purchases of products or subscriptions to services, or to use competing products or services. customers may also increase their expenditures on protecting their existing computer systems from attack, which could delay adoption of additional products or services. any of these actions by customers could adversely affect our revenue. actual or perceived vulnerabilities may lead to claims against us. although our license agreements typically contain provisions that eliminate or limit our exposure to such liability, there is no assurance these provisions will withstand legal challenges. legislative or regulatory action may increase the costs to develop or implement our products and services.  improper disclosure of personal data could result in liability and harm our reputation.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0as we continue to grow the number and scale of our cloud-based offerings, we store and process increasingly large amounts of personally identifiable information of our customers. at the same time, the continued occurrence of high-profile data breaches provides evidence of an external environment increasingly hostile to information security. this environment demands that we continuously improve our design and coordination of security controls across our business groups and geographies. despite these efforts, it is possible our security controls over personal data, our training of employees and vendors on data security, and other practices we follow may not prevent the improper disclosure of personally identifiable information that we or our vendors store and manage. improper disclosure of this information could harm our reputation, lead to legal exposure to customers, or subject us to liability under laws that protect personal data, resulting in increased costs or loss of revenue. our software products and services also enable our customers to store and process personal data on premise or, increasingly, in a cloud-based environment we host. we believe consumers using our email, messaging, storage, sharing, and social networking services will increasingly want efficient, centralized methods of choosing their privacy preferences and controlling their data. perceptions that our products or services do not adequately protect the privacy of personal information could inhibit sales of our products or services, and could constrain consumer and business adoption of our cloud-based solutions.  we may experience outages, data losses, and disruptions of our online services if we fail to maintain an adequate operations infrastructure.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0our increasing user traffic and the complexity of our products and services demand more computing power. we have spent and expect to continue to spend substantial amounts to purchase or lease data centers and equipment and to upgrade our technology and network infrastructure to handle more traffic on our websites and in our data centers, and to introduce new products and services and support existing services such as bing, exchange online, office 365, sharepoint online, skydrive, skype, xbox live, windows azure, outlook.com, and microsoft office web apps. we also are growing our business of providing a platform and back-end hosting for services provided by third-party businesses to their end customers. maintaining and expanding this infrastructure is expensive and complex. inefficiencies or operational failures, including temporary or permanent loss of customer data, could diminish the quality of our products, services, and user experience resulting in contractual liability, claims by customers and other third parties, damage to our reputation and loss of current and potential users, subscribers, and advertisers, each of which may harm our operating results and financial condition.  we are subject to government litigation and regulatory activity that may limit how we design and market our products.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0as a leading global software maker, we are closely scrutinized by government agencies under u.s. and foreign competition laws. some jurisdictions also provide private rights of action for competitors or consumers to assert claims of anti-competitive conduct. for example, we were sued on competition law grounds by the u.s. department of justice, 18 states, and the district of columbia in the late 1990s. the resolution of the government lawsuits imposed various constraints on our windows operating system businesses. although these constraints expired in may 2011, we expect that federal and state antitrust authorities will continue to closely scrutinize our business.  \u00a0 18  table of contents  \u00a0 part i  item 1a  \u00a0 the european commission closely scrutinizes the design of high-volume microsoft products and the terms on which we make certain technologies used in these products, such as file formats, programming interfaces, and protocols, available to other companies. in 2004, the commission ordered us to create new versions of windows that do not include certain multimedia technologies and to provide our competitors with specifications for how to implement certain proprietary windows communications protocols in their own products. in 2009, the commission accepted a set of commitments offered by microsoft to address the commission\u0092s concerns relating to competition in web browsing software, including an undertaking to address commission concerns relating to interoperability. these obligations may limit our ability to innovate in windows or other products in the future, diminish the developer appeal of the windows platform, and increase our product development costs. the availability of licenses related to protocols and file formats may enable competitors to develop software products that better mimic the functionality of our products which could hamper sales of our\u00a0products.  government regulatory actions and court decisions such as these may hinder our ability to provide the benefits of our software to consumers and businesses, thereby reducing the attractiveness of our products and the revenue that come from them. new competition law actions could be initiated at any time. the outcome of such actions, or steps taken to avoid them, could adversely affect us in a variety of ways, including:  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 our products and online services offerings, including new technologies we develop or acquire such as skype, are subject to government regulation in some jurisdictions, including in areas of user privacy, telecommunications, data protection, and online content. the application of these laws and regulations to our business is often unclear, subject to change over time, and sometimes may conflict from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. additionally these laws and governments\u0092 approach to their enforcement, as well as our products and services, are continuing to evolve. compliance with these types of regulation may involve significant costs or require changes in products or business practices that result in reduced revenue. noncompliance could result in penalties being imposed on us or orders that we stop the alleged noncompliant activity.  our business depends on our ability to attract and retain talented employees.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0our business is based on successfully attracting and retaining talented employees. the market for highly skilled workers and leaders in our industry is extremely competitive. we are limited in our ability to recruit internationally by restrictive domestic immigration laws. if we are less successful in our recruiting efforts, or if we are unable to retain key employees, our ability to develop and deliver successful products and services may be adversely affected. effective succession planning is also important to our long-term success. failure to ensure effective transfer of knowledge and smooth transitions involving key employees could hinder our strategic planning and execution.  delays in product development schedules may adversely affect our revenue.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0the development of software products is a complex and time-consuming process. new products and enhancements to existing products can require long development and testing periods. our increasing focus on devices and cloud-based services also presents new and complex development issues. significant delays in new product or service releases or significant problems in creating new products or services could adversely affect our revenue.  \u00a0 19  table of contents  \u00a0 part i  item 1a  \u00a0 adverse economic or market conditions may harm our business.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0unfavorable changes in economic conditions, including inflation, recession, or other changes in economic conditions, may result in lower it spending and adversely affect our revenue. if demand for pcs, servers, and other computing devices declines, or consumer or business spending for those products declines, our revenue will be adversely affected. our product distribution system also relies on an extensive partner and retail network. oems building devices that run our software have also been a significant means of distribution. the impact of economic conditions on our partners, such as the bankruptcy of a major distributor, oem, or retailer, could result in sales channel disruption. challenging economic conditions also may impair the ability of our customers to pay for products and services they have purchased. as a result, allowances for doubtful accounts and write-offs of accounts receivable may increase. we maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings, types, and maturities. these investments are subject to general credit, liquidity, market, and interest rate risks, which may be exacerbated by unusual events that affect global financial markets. a significant part of our investment portfolio consists of u.s. government securities. if global credit and equity markets experience prolonged periods of decline, or if there is a downgrade of u.s. government debt, our investment portfolio may be adversely impacted and we could determine that more of our investments have experienced an other-than-temporary decline in fair value, requiring impairment charges that could adversely affect our financial results.  we have claims and lawsuits against us that may result in adverse outcomes.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0we are subject to a variety of claims and lawsuits. adverse outcomes in some or all of these claims may result in significant monetary damages or injunctive relief that could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business. the litigation and other claims are subject to inherent uncertainties and management\u0092s view of these matters may change in the future. a material adverse impact on our financial statements also could occur for the period in which the effect of an unfavorable final outcome becomes probable and reasonably estimable.  we may have additional tax liabilities.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0we are subject to income taxes in the u.s. and many foreign jurisdictions. significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes. in the ordinary course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. we regularly are under audit by tax authorities. economic\u00a0and political\u00a0pressures to increase tax revenues in various jurisdictions may make resolving tax disputes more difficult. although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals. the results of an audit or litigation could have a material effect on our financial statements in the period or periods for which that determination is made.  we earn a significant amount of our operating income from outside the u.s., and any repatriation of funds currently held in foreign jurisdictions to the u.s. may result in higher effective tax rates for the company. in addition, there have been proposals from congress to change u.s. tax laws that would significantly impact how u.s. multinational corporations are taxed on foreign earnings. although we cannot predict whether or in what form any proposed legislation may pass, if enacted it could have a material adverse impact on our tax expense and cash flows.  our hardware and software products may experience quality or supply problems.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0our vertically-integrated hardware products such as the xbox 360 console, surface, and other hardware devices we design and market are highly complex and can have defects in design, manufacture, or associated software. we could incur significant expenses, lost revenue, and reputational harm if we fail to detect or effectively address such issues through design, testing, or warranty repairs. we obtain some components of our hardware devices from sole suppliers. our competitors use some of the same suppliers and their demand for hardware components can affect the amount of capacity available to us. if a component delivery from a sole-source supplier is delayed or becomes unavailable or industry shortages occur, we may be unable to obtain timely replacement supplies, resulting in reduced sales. component shortages, excess or obsolete inventory, or price reductions resulting in inventory adjustments may increase our cost of revenue. xbox 360 consoles and surface are assembled in asia; disruptions in the supply chain may result in shortages that would affect our revenue and operating margins. these same risks would apply to any other vertically-integrated hardware and software products we may offer.  our stand-alone software products also may experience quality or reliability problems. the highly sophisticated software products we develop may contain bugs and other defects that interfere with their intended operation. any defects we do not detect and fix in pre-release testing could result in reduced sales and revenue, damage to our  \u00a0 20  table of contents  \u00a0 part i  item 1a, 1b  \u00a0  reputation, repair or remediation costs, delays in the release of new products or versions, or legal liability. although our license agreements typically contain provisions that eliminate or limit our exposure to liability, there is no assurance these provisions will withstand legal challenge.  if our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets become impaired we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0we acquire other companies and intangible assets and may not realize all the economic benefit from those acquisitions, which could result in an impairment of goodwill or intangibles. under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states, we review our amortizable intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. we test goodwill for impairment at least annually. factors that may be considered a change in circumstances, indicating that the carrying value of our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets may not be recoverable, include a decline in stock price and market capitalization, reduced future cash flow estimates, and slower growth rates in our industry. we may be required to record a significant charge in our financial statements during the period in which any impairment of our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets is determined, negatively impacting our results of operations. for example, in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2012, we recorded a $6.2 billion charge for the impairment of goodwill in our online services division business segment.  we operate a global business that exposes us to additional risks.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0we operate in over 100 countries and a significant part of our revenue comes from international sales. competitive or regulatory pressure to make our pricing structure uniform might require that we reduce the sales price of our software in the u.s. and other countries. operations outside the u.s. may be affected by changes in trade protection laws, policies and measures, and other regulatory requirements affecting trade and investment. the foreign corrupt practices act and local laws (\u0093anti-corruption laws\u0094) prohibit corrupt payments by our employees, vendors, or agents. while we devote substantial resources to our global compliance programs and have implemented certain policies, training, and internal controls designed to reduce the risk of corrupt payments, if we fail to comply with anti-corruption laws, we may be exposed to significant fines and penalties. emerging markets are a significant focus of our international growth strategy. the developing nature of these markets presents a number of risks. deterioration of social, political, labor, or economic conditions in a specific country or region, such as current uncertainties relating to european economic weakness, and difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations, may also adversely affect our operations or financial results. although we hedge a portion of our international currency exposure, significant fluctuations in exchange rates between the u.s. dollar and foreign currencies may adversely affect our revenue.  catastrophic events or geo-political conditions may disrupt our business.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0a disruption or failure of our systems or operations because of a major earthquake, weather event, cyber-attack, terrorist attack, or other catastrophic event could cause delays in completing sales, providing services, or performing other mission-critical functions. our corporate headquarters, a significant portion of our research and development activities, and certain other critical business operations are located in the seattle, washington area, and we have other business operations in the silicon valley area of california, both of which are near major earthquake faults. a catastrophic event that results in the destruction or disruption of any of our critical business or it systems could harm our ability to conduct normal business operations. our move toward providing our customers with more services and solutions in the cloud puts a premium on the resilience of our systems and strength of our business continuity management plans, and magnifies the potential impact of prolonged service outages on our operating results. abrupt political change, terrorist activity, and armed conflict pose a risk of general economic disruption in affected countries, which may increase our operating costs. these conditions also may add uncertainty to the timing and budget for technology investment decisions by our customers, and may result in supply chain disruptions for hardware manufacturers, either of which may adversely affect our revenue. the long-term effects of climate change on the global economy in general or the it industry in particular are unclear. environmental regulations or changes in the supply, demand or available sources of energy may affect the availability or cost of goods and services, including natural resources, necessary to run our business. changes in weather where we operate may increase the costs of powering and cooling computer hardware we use to develop software and provide cloud-based services.  item\u00a01b.\u00a0unresolved staff comments  we have received no written comments regarding our periodic or current reports from the staff of the sec that were issued 180 days or more preceding the end of our fiscal year 2013 that remain unresolved.  \u00a0 21  table of contents  \u00a0 part ii  item 7  \u00a0 we generate revenue by developing, licensing, and supporting a wide range of software products, by offering an array of services, including cloud-based services to consumers and businesses, by designing and selling devices that integrate with our cloud-based services, and by delivering relevant online advertising to a global audience. our most significant expenses are related to compensating employees, designing, manufacturing, marketing, and selling our products and services, and income taxes.  industry trends  our industry is dynamic and highly competitive, with frequent changes in both technologies and business models. each industry shift is an opportunity to conceive new products, new technologies, or new ideas that can further transform the industry and our business. at microsoft, we push the boundaries of what is possible through a broad range of research and development activities that seek to identify and address the changing demands of customers, industry trends, and competitive forces.  key opportunities and investments  based on our assessment of key technology trends and our broad focus on long-term research and development of new products and services, we see significant opportunities to generate future growth.  we invest research and development resources in new products and services in these areas. the capabilities and accessibility of pcs, tablets, phones, televisions, and other devices powered by rich software platforms and applications continue to grow. with this trend, we believe the full potential of software will be seen and felt in how people use these devices and the associated services at work and in their personal lives.  devices with end-user services  we work with an ecosystem of partners to deliver a broad spectrum of windows devices. in some cases, we build our own devices, as we have chosen to do with xbox and surface. in all our work with partners and on our own devices, we focus on delivering seamless services and experiences across devices. as consumer services and hardware advance, we expect they will continue to better complement one another, connecting the devices people use daily to unique communications, productivity, and entertainment services from microsoft and our partners and developers around the world.  windows 8 reflects this shift. launched in october 2012, windows 8 was designed to unite the light, thin, and convenient aspects of a tablet with the power of a pc. the windows 8 operating system includes the windows store, which offers a large and growing number of applications from microsoft and partners for both business and consumer customers.  going forward, our strategy will focus on creating a family of devices and services for individuals and businesses that empower people around the globe at home, at work, and on the go, for the activities they value most. this strategy will require investment in datacenters and other infrastructure to support our services, and will bring continued competition with apple, google, and other well-established and emerging competitors. we believe our history of powering devices such as windows pcs and xbox, as well as our experience delivering high-value experiences through office and other applications, will position us for future success.  services for the enterprise  today, businesses face important opportunities and challenges. enterprises are asked to deploy technology that drives business strategy forward. they decide what solutions will make employees more productive, collaborative, and satisfied, or connect with customers in new and compelling ways. they work to unlock business insights from a world of data. at the same time, they must manage and secure corporate information that employees access across a growing number of personal and corporate devices.  \u00a0 24  table of contents  \u00a0 part ii  item 7  \u00a0 to address these opportunities, businesses look to our world-class business applications like microsoft dynamics, office, exchange, sharepoint, lync, yammer, and our business intelligence solutions. they rely on our technology to manage employee corporate identity and to protect their corporate data. and, increasingly, businesses of all sizes are looking to microsoft to realize the benefits of the cloud.  helping businesses move to the cloud is one of our largest opportunities. cloud-based solutions provide customers with software, services, and content over the internet by way of shared computing resources located in centralized data centers. the shift to the cloud is driven by three important economies of scale: larger data centers can deploy computational resources at significantly lower cost per unit than smaller ones; larger data centers can coordinate and aggregate diverse customer, geographic, and application demand patterns improving the utilization of computing, storage, and network resources; and multi-tenancy lowers application maintenance labor costs for large public clouds. because of the improved economics, the cloud offers unique levels of elasticity and agility that enable new solutions and applications. for businesses of all sizes, the cloud creates the opportunity to focus on innovation while leaving non-differentiating activities to reliable and cost-effective providers.  unique to microsoft, we continue to design and deliver cloud solutions that allow our customers to use both the cloud and their on-premise assets however best suits their own needs. for example, a company can choose to deploy office or microsoft dynamics on premise, as a cloud service, or a combination of both. with windows server 2012, windows azure, and system center infrastructure, businesses can deploy applications in their own datacenter, a partner\u0092s datacenter, or in microsoft\u0092s datacenter with common security, management, and administration across all environments, with the flexibility and scale they desire. these hybrid capabilities allow customers to fully harness the power of the cloud so they can achieve greater levels of efficiency and tap new areas of growth.  our future opportunity  there are several distinct areas of technology that we are focused on driving forward. our goal is to lead the industry in these areas over the long-term, which we expect will translate to sustained growth well into the future. we are investing significant resources in:  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 we believe the breadth of our devices and services portfolio, our large, global partner and customer base, and the growing windows ecosystem position us to be a leader in these areas.  economic conditions, challenges, and risks  the market for software, devices, and cloud-based services is dynamic and highly competitive. some of our traditional businesses such as the windows operating system are in a period of transition. our competitors are developing new devices and deploy competing cloud-based services for consumers and businesses. the devices and form factors customers prefer evolve rapidly, and influence how users access services in the cloud and in some cases the user\u0092s choice of which suite of cloud-based services to use. the windows ecosystem must continue to evolve and adapt, over an extended time, in pace with this changing environment. to support our strategy of offering  \u00a0 25  table of contents  \u00a0 part ii  item 7  \u00a0  a family of devices and services designed to empower our customers for the activities they value most, we announced a functional realignment in july 2013. through this realignment our goal is to become more nimble, collaborative, communicative, motivated, and decisive. even if we achieve these benefits, the investments we are making in devices and infrastructure to support our cloud-based services will increase our operating costs and may decrease our operation margins.  we prioritize our investments among the highest long-term growth opportunities. these investments require significant resources and are multi-year in nature. the products and services we bring to market may be developed internally, as part of a partnership or alliance, or through acquisition.  our success is highly dependent on our ability to attract and retain qualified employees. we hire a mix of university and industry talent worldwide. microsoft competes for talented individuals worldwide by offering broad customer reach, scale in resources, and competitive compensation.  aggregate demand for our software, services, and hardware is correlated to global macroeconomic factors, which remain dynamic. see a discussion of these factors and other risks under risk factors (part i, item\u00a01a of this form\u00a010-k).  seasonality  our revenue historically has fluctuated quarterly and has generally been highest in the second quarter of our fiscal year due to corporate calendar year-end spending trends in our major markets and holiday season spending by consumers. our entertainment and devices division is particularly seasonal as its products are aimed at the consumer market and are in highest demand during the holiday shopping season. typically, the entertainment and devices division has generated approximately 40% of its yearly revenue in our second fiscal quarter.  unearned revenue  quarterly and annual revenue may be impacted by the deferral of revenue. see the discussions below regarding revenue deferred on sales of windows 7 with an option to upgrade to windows 8 pro at a discounted price (the \u0093windows upgrade offer\u0094) and sales of the previous version of the microsoft office system with a guarantee to be upgraded to the new office at minimal or no cost (the \u0093office upgrade offer\u0094, for the offer relating to the new office, and \u0093the 2010 office upgrade offer\u0094 for the prior offer relating to office 2010).  if our customers elect to license cloud-based versions of our products and services rather than licensing transaction-based products and services, the associated revenue will shift from being recognized at the time of the transaction to being recognized over the subscription period or upon consumption, as applicable.  results of operations  summary  \u00a0 fiscal year 2013 compared with fiscal year 2012  revenue increased, primarily due to higher revenue from server and tools as well as revenue from new products and services, including windows 8, surface, and the new office, offset in part by the impact on revenue of a decline in the x86 pc market.  \u00a0 26  table of contents  \u00a0 part ii  item 7  \u00a0 operating income grew, primarily due to the $6.2 billion goodwill impairment charge related to our osd business recorded during the prior year. other key changes in cost of revenue and operating expenses were:  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 fiscal year 2012 compared with fiscal year 2011  revenue increased primarily due to strong sales of server and tools products and services and the 2010 microsoft office system, offset in part by the decline in windows operating system revenue primarily due to the deferral of $540 million of revenue relating to the windows upgrade offer. revenue in fiscal year 2012 also included skype revenue from the date of acquisition.  operating income decreased reflecting a goodwill impairment charge of $6.2 billion related to our osd business segment. other key changes in cost of revenue and operating expenses were:  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 headcount-related expenses were higher across the company reflecting a 4% increase in headcount from june\u00a030, 2011 and changes in our employee compensation program.  fiscal year 2012 diluted earnings per share were negatively impacted by the non-tax deductible goodwill impairment charge, which decreased diluted earnings per share by $0.73. fiscal year 2011 net income and diluted earnings per share reflected a partial settlement with the u.s. internal revenue service (\u0093i.r.s.\u0094) and higher other income. the partial settlement with the i.r.s. added $461 million to net income and $0.05 to diluted earnings per share in fiscal year 2011.  segment revenue/operating income (loss)  the revenue and operating income (loss) amounts in this section are presented on a basis consistent with accounting principles generally accepted in the u.s. (\u0093u.s. gaap\u0094) and include certain reconciling items attributable to each of the segments. segment information appearing in note 21 \u0096 segment information and geographic data of the notes to financial statements (part ii, item\u00a08 of this form 10-k) is presented on a basis consistent with our internal management reporting. certain corporate-level activity has been excluded from segment operating results and is analyzed separately. we have recast certain prior period amounts within this md&a to conform to the way we internally managed and monitored segment performance during fiscal year 2013, reflecting immaterial movements of  \u00a0 27  table of contents  \u00a0 part ii  item 7  \u00a0  business activities between segments and changes in cost allocations. in july 2013, we announced a change in organizational structure as part of our transformation to a devices and services company. as we evolve how we allocate resources and analyze performance in the new structure, it is possible that our segments may change.  windows division  \u00a0  windows division develops and markets operating systems for computing devices, related software and online services, surface rt and pro devices, and pc accessories. this collection of software, hardware, and services is designed to empower individuals, companies, and organizations and to simplify everyday tasks through seamless operations across the user\u0092s hardware and software. the general availability of surface rt and windows 8 started october\u00a026, 2012. the general availability of surface pro started february\u00a09, 2013.  currently, approximately 65% of total windows division revenue comes from windows operating systems purchased by original equipment manufacturers (\u0093oems\u0094) and pre-installed on devices they sell. the remaining windows division revenue is generated by commercial and retail sales of windows, surface, pc accessories, and online advertising.  fiscal year 2013 compared with fiscal year 2012  windows division revenue increased $839 million. surface revenue was $853 million. revenue from commercial licensing of windows increased $487 million, while unearned revenue from commercial licensing also increased, reflecting continued support of our platform. in addition, we recognized $540 million of previously deferred revenue related to the expiration of the windows upgrade offer. partially offsetting these increases was a decrease in oem revenue. oem revenue decreased 3%. excluding the impact of the windows upgrade offer, oem revenue decreased 10%. this decrease primarily reflects the impact on revenue of the decline in the x86 pc market, which we estimate declined approximately 9%. in may 2013, we announced that we had surpassed 100\u00a0million licenses sold for windows 8.  windows division operating income decreased, primarily due to higher cost of revenue and sales and marketing expenses, offset in part by revenue growth. cost of revenue increased $1.8 billion, reflecting a $1.6 billion increase in product costs associated with surface and windows 8, including a charge for surface rt inventory adjustments of approximately $900 million. sales and marketing expenses increased $1.0 billion or 34%, reflecting an $898 million increase in advertising costs associated primarily with windows 8 and surface.  fiscal year 2012 compared with fiscal year 2011  windows division revenue reflected relative performance in the pc market segments. we estimate that sales of pcs to businesses grew approximately 4% and sales of pcs to consumers decreased 1%. excluding a decline in sales of netbooks, we estimate that sales of pcs to consumers grew approximately 5%. taken together, the total pc market increased an estimated 0% to 2%. relative to pc market growth, windows division revenue was negatively impacted by higher growth in emerging markets, where average selling prices are lower than developed markets, and the deferral of $540 million of revenue relating to the windows upgrade offer.  windows division operating income decreased, due mainly to lower revenue and a $172 million or 11% increase in research and development expenses, primarily associated with the windows 8 operating system.  \u00a0 28  table of contents  \u00a0 part ii  item 7  \u00a0 server and tools  \u00a0  server and tools develops and markets technology and related services that enable information technology professionals and their systems to be more productive and efficient. server and tools product and service offerings include windows server, microsoft sql server, windows azure, visual studio, system center products, windows embedded device platforms, and enterprise services. enterprise services comprise premier product support services and microsoft consulting services. we also offer developer tools, training, and certification. approximately 80% of server and tools revenue comes from product revenue, including purchases through volume licensing programs, licenses sold to oems, and retail packaged product, while the remainder comes from enterprise services.  fiscal year 2013 compared with fiscal year 2012  server and tools revenue increased in both product sales and enterprise services. product revenue increased $1.3 billion or 9%, driven primarily by growth in microsoft sql server, system center, and windows server. enterprise services revenue grew $434 million or 11%, due to growth in both premier product support and consulting services.  server and tools operating income increased, primarily due to revenue growth, offset in part by higher cost of revenue and sales and marketing expenses. cost of revenue grew $589 million or 15%, reflecting a $269 million increase in headcount-related expenses and a $169 million increase in datacenter expenses. headcount-related expenses increased due mainly to higher enterprise services headcount supporting revenue growth, while datacenter expenses grew primarily to support our online services offerings. sales and marketing expenses grew $160 million or 3%, reflecting increased fees paid to third-party enterprise software advisors and corporate sales and marketing activities.  fiscal year 2012 compared with fiscal year 2011  server and tools revenue increased in both product sales and enterprise services. product revenue increased $1.4 billion or 11%, driven primarily by growth in sql server, windows server, and system center, reflecting continued adoption of the windows platform. enterprise services revenue grew $585 million or 17%, due to growth in both premier product support and consulting services.  server and tools operating income increased primarily due to revenue growth, offset in part by higher costs of providing products and services and increased sales and marketing expenses. cost of revenue increased $678 million or 22%, primarily reflecting higher enterprise services headcount-related expenses. sales and marketing expenses grew $154 million or 3%, reflecting increased corporate marketing activities.  online services division  \u00a0  \u00a0 online services division (\u0093osd\u0094) develops and markets information and content designed to help people simplify tasks and make more informed decisions online, and help advertisers connect with audiences. osd offerings include bing, bing ads, and msn. bing and msn generate revenue through the sale of search and display advertising, accounting for nearly all of osd\u0092s revenue.  \u00a0 29  table of contents  \u00a0 part ii  item 7  \u00a0 fiscal year 2013 compared with fiscal year 2012  online advertising revenue grew $409 million or 16% to $3.0 billion, reflecting an increase in search advertising revenue, offset in part by a decrease in display advertising revenue. search revenue grew primarily due to increased revenue per search, resulting from ongoing improvements in ad products, while display advertising revenue decreased primarily due to industry-wide market pressure.  osd\u0092s operating loss decreased, primarily due to the prior year goodwill impairment charge of $6.2 billion. operating loss was further reduced by higher revenue and lower cost of revenue and operating expenses. cost of revenue decreased $302 million or 12%, driven by a $271 million decrease in traffic acquisition costs as well as lower yahoo! reimbursement costs. sales and marketing expenses were $120 million or 15% lower, due mainly to decreased corporate sales and marketing activities. research and development costs increased $94 million or 7%, due primarily to higher headcount-related expenses resulting mainly from increased headcount.  fiscal year 2012 compared with fiscal year 2011  online advertising revenue grew $317 million or 14% to $2.6 billion, reflecting continued growth in search advertising revenue, offset in part by decreased display advertising revenue. search revenue grew due to increased revenue per search, increased volumes reflecting general market growth, and share gains in the u.s. according to third-party sources, bing organic u.s. market share for the month of june 2012 was approximately 16%, and grew 120 basis points year over year. bing-powered u.s. market share, including yahoo! properties, was approximately 26% for the month of june 2012, down 100 basis points year over year.  osd\u0092s fiscal year 2012 operating loss reflects a goodwill impairment charge of $6.2 billion, which we recorded as a result of our annual goodwill impairment test in the fourth quarter. the non-cash, non-tax-deductible charge related mainly to goodwill acquired through our 2007 acquisition of aquantive, inc. excluding the $6.2 billion goodwill impairment charge, osd\u0092s operating loss was reduced by higher revenue and lower sales and marketing expenses and cost of revenue. sales and marketing expenses decreased $321 million or 29%, due mainly to lower marketing spend. cost of revenue decreased $208 million, driven by lower yahoo! reimbursement costs, amortization, and online operating costs.  microsoft business division  \u00a0  microsoft business division (\u0093mbd\u0094) develops and markets software and online services designed to increase personal, team, and organization productivity. mbd offerings include the microsoft office system (\u0093office,\u0094 comprising mainly the core office product set, office 365, sharepoint, exchange, and lync), which generates over 90% of mbd revenue, and microsoft dynamics business solutions. the general availability of the new office started on january\u00a029, 2013.  we evaluate mbd results based upon the nature of the end user in two primary parts: business revenue and consumer revenue. business revenue includes office revenue generated through subscription and volume licensing agreements with software assurance, license-only agreements for office, and microsoft dynamics revenue. consumer revenue includes revenue from retail packaged product sales and oem revenue.  fiscal year 2013 compared with fiscal year 2012  mbd revenue increased reflecting growth in business revenue, partially offset by a decline in consumer revenue. business revenue increased $1.2\u00a0billion or 6%, which reflects 11% growth in office revenue from subscriptions and  \u00a0 30  table of contents  \u00a0 part ii  item 7  \u00a0  volume licensing agreements with software assurance, and a 12% increase in microsoft dynamics revenue, offset in part by a 9% decrease in office license-only revenue. consumer revenue decreased $582 million or 13%, primarily driven by the impact on revenue of a decline in the x86 pc market.  mbd revenue for the year ended june\u00a030, 2013 included an unfavorable foreign currency impact of $475 million.  mbd operating income increased, primarily due to revenue growth, offset in part by higher sales and marketing expenses and cost of revenue. sales and marketing expenses grew $185 million or 5%, primarily due to higher advertising expenses, fees paid to third-party software advisors, and increased cross-platform marketing activities. cost of revenue grew $108 million or 6%, primarily due to an increase in online operation and support costs.  fiscal year 2012 compared with fiscal year 2011  mbd revenue increased primarily reflecting sales of office. business revenue increased $1.7\u00a0billion or 9%, primarily reflecting growth in multi-year volume licensing revenue, licensing of office to transactional business customers, and a 9% increase in microsoft dynamics revenue. consumer revenue decreased $193 million or 4% due to the recognition of $254 million of revenue in the prior year associated with the 2010 office upgrade offer. excluding the fiscal year 2011 impact associated with the 2010 office upgrade offer, consumer revenue increased $61 million, driven by increased sales of office.  mbd revenue for the year ended june\u00a030, 2012 included a favorable foreign currency impact of $506 million.  mbd operating income increased, primarily due to revenue growth, offset in part by higher cost of revenue and research and development expenses. cost of revenue increased $278 million or 17%, primarily due to higher online operation and support costs. research and development expenses increased, due mainly to an increase in headcount-related expenses.  entertainment and devices division  \u00a0  entertainment and devices division (\u0093edd\u0094) develops and markets products and services designed to entertain and connect people. edd offerings include the xbox entertainment platform (which includes the xbox 360 gaming and entertainment console, kinect for xbox 360, xbox 360 video games, xbox live, and xbox 360 accessories), skype, and windows phone, including related patent licensing revenue. we acquired skype on october\u00a013, 2011, and its results of operations from that date are reflected in our results discussed below. in june 2013, we announced that we expect our next generation console, xbox one, to be available for purchase in the second quarter of fiscal year 2014.  fiscal year 2013 compared with fiscal year 2012  edd revenue increased, due to higher windows phone and skype revenue, offset in part by lower xbox 360 platform revenue. windows phone revenue increased $1.2 billion, including an increase in patent licensing revenue and sales of windows phone licenses. skype revenue increased, due primarily to including a full year of results in fiscal year 2013. xbox 360 platform revenue decreased $950 million or 12%, due mainly to lower volumes of consoles sold, offset in part by higher xbox live revenue. we shipped 9.8\u00a0million xbox 360 consoles during fiscal year 2013, compared with 13.0\u00a0million xbox 360 consoles during fiscal year 2012.  edd operating income increased, primarily due to revenue growth and lower cost of revenue, offset in part by higher operating expenses. sales and marketing expenses decreased $176 million or 16%, reflecting a $248 million  \u00a0 31  table of contents  \u00a0 part ii  item 7  \u00a0  decrease in xbox 360 platform marketing. cost of revenue decreased $143 million or 2%, due mainly to a $1.0 billion decrease in manufacturing and distribution costs associated with lower volumes of xbox 360 consoles sold, offset in part by a $375 million increase in expenses for payments made to nokia related to joint strategic initiatives and a $273 million increase in royalties on xbox live content. research and development expenses increased $432 million or 28%, reflecting $246 million higher headcount-related expenses, resulting mainly from increased headcount in connection with the xbox platform and skype.  fiscal year 2012 compared with fiscal year 2011  edd revenue increased primarily reflecting skype and windows phone revenue, offset in part by lower xbox 360 platform revenue. xbox 360 platform revenue decreased $107 million, due mainly to decreased volumes of kinect for xbox 360 sold and lower video game revenue, offset in part by higher xbox live revenue. we shipped 13.0\u00a0million xbox 360 consoles during fiscal year 2012, compared with 13.7\u00a0million xbox 360 consoles during fiscal year 2011. video game revenue decreased due to strong sales of halo reach in the prior year.  edd operating income decreased reflecting higher cost of revenue and operating expenses, offset in part by revenue growth. cost of revenue grew $896 million or 16%, primarily due to changes in the mix of products and services sold and payments made to nokia related to joint strategic initiatives. research and development expenses increased $366 million or 31%, primarily reflecting higher headcount-related expenses. sales and marketing expenses increased $242 million or 27%, primarily reflecting the inclusion of skype expenses.  corporate-level activity  \u00a0  certain corporate-level activity is not allocated to our segments, including costs of: broad-based sales and marketing; product support services; human resources; legal; finance; information technology; corporate development and procurement activities; research and development; costs of operating our retail stores; and legal settlements and contingencies.  fiscal year 2013 compared with fiscal year 2012  corporate-level expenses increased, primarily due to higher legal charges from the european commission fine of \u0080561\u00a0million (approximately $733 million) for failure to comply with our 2009 agreement to display a \u0093browser choice screen\u0094 on windows pcs where internet explorer is the default browser (the \u0093eu fine\u0094). corporate-level expenses also grew due to a $350 million increase in retail stores expenses and $287 million higher intellectual property licensing costs.  fiscal year 2012 compared with fiscal year 2011  corporate-level expenses increased due mainly to full year puerto rican excise taxes, higher headcount-related expenses, and changes in foreign currency exchange rates. these increases were offset in part by lower legal charges, which were $56 million in fiscal year 2012 compared with $332 million in fiscal year 2011.  cost of revenue  cost of revenue  \u00a0  \u00a0 32  table of contents  \u00a0 part ii  item 7  \u00a0 cost of revenue includes: manufacturing and distribution costs for products sold, including xbox and

million higher intellectual property licensing costs, a $273 million increase in royalties on xbox live content, and a $152 million increase in retail store expenses, offset in part by a $1.0 billion decrease in manufacturing and distribution costs associated with lower volumes of xbox 360 consoles sold and a $431 million decrease in traffic acquisition costs.  fiscal year 2012 compared with fiscal year 2011  cost of revenue increased reflecting higher headcount-related expenses, payments made to nokia, and changes in the mix of products and services sold. headcount-related expenses increased 20%, primarily related to increased enterprise services headcount.  operating expenses  research and development  \u00a0  research and development expenses include payroll, employee benefits, stock-based compensation expense, and other headcount-related expenses associated with product development. research and development expenses also include third-party development and programming costs, localization costs incurred to translate software for international markets, and the amortization of purchased software code.  fiscal year 2013 compared with fiscal year 2012  research and development expenses increased, reflecting a $460 million or 6% increase in headcount-related expenses, largely related to the entertainment and devices division.  fiscal year 2012 compared with fiscal year 2011  research and development expenses increased, primarily reflecting a 10% increase in headcount-related expenses.  sales and marketing  \u00a0  \u00a0 33  table of contents  \u00a0 part ii  item 7  \u00a0 sales and marketing expenses include payroll, employee benefits, stock-based compensation expense, and other headcount-related expenses associated with sales and marketing personnel and the costs of advertising, promotions, trade shows, seminars, and other programs.  fiscal year 2013 compared with fiscal year 2012  sales and marketing expenses grew, reflecting an $898 million increase in advertising costs associated primarily with windows 8 and surface, $181 million higher fees paid to third-party software advisors, and a $145 million or 2% increase in headcount-related expenses.  fiscal year 2012 compared with fiscal year 2011  sales and marketing expenses decreased slightly, primarily reflecting decreased advertising and marketing of the xbox 360 platform, windows phone, and bing, offset in part by a 5% increase in headcount-related expenses.  general and administrative  \u00a0  general and administrative expenses include payroll, employee benefits, stock-based compensation expense, severance expense, and other headcount-related expenses associated with finance, legal, facilities, certain human resources and other administrative personnel, certain taxes, and legal and other administrative fees.  fiscal year 2013 compared with fiscal year 2012  general and administrative expenses increased due to higher legal charges from the eu fine.  fiscal year 2012 compared with fiscal year 2011  general and administrative expenses increased, primarily due to a 10% increase in headcount-related expenses and a full year of puerto rican excise taxes, offset in part by a decrease in legal charges.  goodwill impairment  we test goodwill for impairment annually on may\u00a01 at the reporting unit level using a fair value approach. no impairment of goodwill was identified as of may\u00a01, 2013. our goodwill impairment test as of may\u00a01, 2012, indicated that osd\u0092s carrying value exceeded its estimated fair value. accordingly, we recorded a non-cash, non-tax deductible goodwill impairment charge of $6.2 billion during the three months ended june\u00a030, 2012, reducing osd\u0092s goodwill from $6.4 billion to $223 million.  \u00a0 34  table of contents  \u00a0 part ii  item 7  \u00a0 other income (expense) and income taxes  other income (expense)  the components of other income (expense) were as follows:  \u00a0 we use derivative instruments to: manage risks related to foreign currencies, equity prices, interest rates, and credit; enhance investment returns; and facilitate portfolio diversification. gains and losses from changes in fair values of derivatives that are not designated as hedges are primarily recognized in other income (expense). other than those derivatives entered into for investment purposes, such as commodity contracts, the gains (losses) are generally economically offset by unrealized gains (losses) in the underlying available-for-sale securities, which are recorded as a component of other comprehensive income (\u0093oci\u0094) until the securities are sold or other-than-temporarily impaired, at which time the amounts are reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income (\u0093aoci\u0094) into other income (expense).  fiscal year 2013 compared with fiscal year 2012  dividends and interest income decreased due to lower yields on our fixed-income investments, offset in part by higher average portfolio investment balances. net recognized gains on investments decreased primarily due to lower gains on sales of equity and fixed-income securities and a gain recognized on the partial sale of our facebook holding in the prior year, offset in part by lower other-than-temporary impairments. other-than-temporary impairments were $208 million in fiscal year 2013, compared with $298 million in fiscal year 2012. net losses on derivatives decreased due to gains on equity derivatives in the current fiscal year as compared with losses in the prior fiscal year, and lower losses on commodity and foreign exchange derivatives as compared to the prior fiscal year, offset in part by losses on interest-rate derivatives in the current fiscal year as compared to gains in the prior fiscal year. for the current year, other reflects recognized gains on divestitures, including the gain recognized upon the divestiture of our 50% share in the msnbc joint venture.  fiscal year 2012 compared with fiscal year 2011  dividends and interest income decreased due to lower yields on our fixed-income investments, offset in part by higher average portfolio investment balances. interest expense increased due to our increased issuance of debt in the prior year. net recognized gains on investments increased, primarily due to higher gains on sales of equity and fixed-income securities and a gain recognized on the partial sale of our facebook holding upon the initial public offering on may\u00a018, 2012, offset in part by higher other-than-temporary impairments. other-than-temporary impairments were $298 million in fiscal year 2012, compared with $80 million in fiscal year 2011. net losses on derivatives increased due to losses on commodity and equity derivatives in the current fiscal year as compared with gains in the prior fiscal year, offset in part by fewer losses on foreign exchange contracts in the current fiscal year as compared to the prior fiscal year. changes in foreign currency remeasurements were primarily due to currency movements net of our hedging activities.  \u00a0 35  table of contents  \u00a0 part ii  item 7  \u00a0 income taxes  fiscal year 2013 compared with fiscal year 2012  our effective tax rate for fiscal years 2013 and 2012 was approximately 19% and 24%, respectively. our effective tax rate was lower than the u.s. federal statutory rate primarily due to earnings taxed at lower rates in foreign jurisdictions resulting from producing and distributing our products and services through our foreign regional operations centers in ireland, singapore, and puerto rico.  our fiscal year 2013 effective rate decreased by 5% from fiscal year 2012 mainly due to a nonrecurring $6.2 billion non-tax deductible goodwill impairment charge that was recorded in fiscal year 2012. the goodwill impairment charge increased our effective tax rate by 10% in fiscal year 2012. in addition, in fiscal years 2013 and 2012, we recognized a reduction of 18% and 21%, respectively, to the effective tax rate due to foreign earnings taxed at lower rates. the decrease in our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2013 was primarily offset by a 1% increase related to the eu fine, which is not tax deductible.  changes in the mix of income before income taxes between the u.s. and foreign countries also impacted our effective tax rates and resulted primarily from changes in the geographic distribution of and changes in consumer demand for our products and services. as discussed above, windows division operating income declined $2.1 billion in fiscal year 2013, while mbd and server and tools operating income increased $362 million and $929 million, respectively, during this same period. we supply windows, our primary windows division product, to customers through our u.s. regional operating center, while we supply the microsoft office system, our primary mbd product, and our server and tools products to customers through our foreign regional operations centers. in fiscal years 2013 and 2012, our u.s. income before income taxes was $6.7 billion and $1.6 billion, respectively, and comprised 25% and 7%, respectively, of our income before income taxes. in fiscal years 2013 and 2012, the foreign income before income taxes was $20.4 billion and $20.7 billion, respectively, and comprised 75% and 93%, respectively, of our income before income taxes. the primary driver for the increase in the u.s. income before income tax in fiscal year 2013 was the goodwill impairment charge recorded during the prior year.  tax contingencies and other tax liabilities were $9.4 billion and $7.6 billion as of june\u00a030, 2013 and 2012, respectively, and are included in other long-term liabilities. this increase relates primarily to transfer pricing, including transfer pricing developments in certain foreign tax jurisdictions, primarily denmark. while we settled a portion of the i.r.s. audit for tax years 2004 to 2006 during the third quarter of fiscal year 2011, we remain under audit for those years. in february 2012, the i.r.s. withdrew its 2011 revenue agents report and reopened the audit phase of the examination. as of june\u00a030, 2013, the primary unresolved issue relates to transfer pricing which could have a significant impact on our financial statements if not resolved favorably. we do not believe it is reasonably possible that the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits will significantly increase or decrease within the next 12 months because we do not believe the remaining open issues will be resolved within the next 12 months. we also continue to be subject to examination by the i.r.s. for tax years 2007 to 2012.  we are subject to income tax in many jurisdictions outside the u.s. our operations in certain jurisdictions remain subject to examination for tax years 1996 to 2012, some of which are currently under audit by local tax authorities. the resolutions of these audits are not expected to be material to our financial statements.  fiscal year 2012 compared with fiscal year 2011  our effective tax rates for fiscal years 2012 and 2011 were approximately 24% and 18%, respectively. our effective tax rates were lower than the u.s. federal statutory rate primarily due to earnings taxed at lower rates in foreign jurisdictions resulting from producing and distributing our products and services through our foreign regional operations centers in ireland, singapore, and puerto rico.  our fiscal year 2012 effective rate increased by 6% from fiscal year 2011 mainly due to a nonrecurring $6.2 billion non-tax deductible goodwill impairment charge that was recorded in the fourth quarter of 2012. the goodwill impairment charge increased our effective tax rate by 10%. in addition, in fiscal years 2012 and 2011, we recognized  \u00a0 36  table of contents  \u00a0 part ii  item 7  \u00a0  a reduction of 21% and 16%, respectively, to the effective tax rate due to foreign earnings taxed at lower rates. in fiscal year 2011, we settled a portion of an i.r.s. audit of tax years 2004 to 2006, which reduced our income tax expense for fiscal year 2011 by $461 million and reduced the effective tax rate by 2%.  changes in the mix of income before income taxes between the u.s. and foreign countries also impacted our effective tax rates and resulted primarily from changes in the geographic distribution of and changes in consumer demand for our products and services. as discussed above, windows division operating income declined $751\u00a0million in fiscal year 2012, while mbd and server and tools operating income increased $1.1 billion and $1.1\u00a0billion, respectively, during this same period. we supply windows, our primary windows division product, to customers through our u.s. regional operating center, while we supply the microsoft office system, our primary mbd product, and our server and tools products to customers through our foreign regional operations centers. in fiscal years 2012 and 2011, our u.s. income before income taxes was $1.6 billion and $8.9 billion, respectively, and comprised 7% and 32%, respectively, of our income before income taxes. in fiscal years 2012 and 2011, the foreign income before income taxes was $20.7 billion and $19.2 billion, respectively, and comprised 93% and 68%, respectively, of our income before income taxes. the primary driver for the decrease in the u.s. income before income tax in fiscal year 2012 was the goodwill impairment charge.  financial condition  cash, cash equivalents, and investments  cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments totaled $77.0 billion as of june\u00a030, 2013, compared with $63.0\u00a0billion as of june\u00a030, 2012. equity and other investments were $10.8 billion as of june\u00a030, 2013, compared with $9.8 billion as of june\u00a030, 2012. our short-term investments are primarily to facilitate liquidity and for capital preservation. they consist predominantly of highly liquid investment-grade fixed-income securities, diversified among industries and individual issuers. the investments are predominantly u.s. dollar-denominated securities, but also include foreign currency-denominated securities in order to diversify risk. our fixed-income investments are exposed to interest rate risk and credit risk. the credit risk and average maturity of our fixed-income portfolio are managed to achieve economic returns that correlate to certain fixed-income indices. the settlement risk related to these investments is insignificant given that the short-term investments held are primarily highly liquid investment-grade fixed-income securities. while we own certain mortgage-backed and asset-backed fixed-income securities, our portfolio as of june\u00a030, 2013 does not contain material direct exposure to subprime mortgages or structured vehicles that derive their value from subprime collateral. the majority of our mortgage-backed securities are collateralized by prime residential mortgages and carry a 100% principal and interest guarantee, primarily from federal national mortgage association, federal home loan mortgage corporation, and government national mortgage association.  we routinely monitor our financial exposure to both sovereign and non-sovereign borrowers and counterparties. our gross exposures to our customers and investments in portugal, italy, ireland, greece, and spain are individually and collectively not material.  of the cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments at june\u00a030, 2013, approximately $69.6 billion was held by our foreign subsidiaries and would be subject to material repatriation tax effects. the amount of cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments held by foreign subsidiaries subject to other restrictions on the free flow of funds (primarily currency and other local regulatory) was approximately $880 million. as of june\u00a030, 2013, approximately 87% of the cash equivalents and short-term investments held by our foreign subsidiaries were invested in u.s. government and agency securities, approximately 4% were invested in corporate notes and bonds of u.s. companies, and 2% were invested in u.s. mortgage-backed securities, all of which are denominated in u.s. dollars.  securities lending  we lend certain fixed-income and equity securities to increase investment returns. the loaned securities continue to be carried as investments on our balance sheet. cash and/or security interests are received as collateral for the loaned securities with the amount determined based upon the underlying security lent and the creditworthiness of  \u00a0 37  table of contents  \u00a0 part ii  item 7  \u00a0  the borrower. cash received is recorded as an asset with a corresponding liability. our securities lending payable balance was $645 million as of june\u00a030, 2013. our average and maximum securities lending payable balances for the fiscal year were $494 million and $1.4 billion, respectively. intra-year variances in the amount of securities loaned are mainly due to fluctuations in the demand for the securities.  valuation  in general, and where applicable, we use quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities to determine the fair value of our financial instruments. this pricing methodology applies to our level 1 investments, such as exchange-traded mutual funds, domestic and international equities, and u.s. government securities. if quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities are not available to determine fair value, then we use quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities or inputs other than the quoted prices that are observable either directly or indirectly. this pricing methodology applies to our level 2 investments such as corporate notes and bonds, foreign government bonds, mortgage-backed securities, and u.s. agency securities. level 3 investments are valued using internally developed models with unobservable inputs. assets and liabilities measured using unobservable inputs are an immaterial portion of our portfolio.  a majority of our investments are priced by pricing vendors and are generally level 1 or level 2 investments as these vendors either provide a quoted market price in an active market or use observable inputs for their pricing without applying significant adjustments. broker pricing is used mainly when a quoted price is not available, the investment is not priced by our pricing vendors, or when a broker price is more reflective of fair values in the market in which the investment trades. our broker-priced investments are generally classified as level 2 investments because the broker prices these investments based on similar assets without applying significant adjustments. in addition, all of our broker-priced investments have a sufficient level of trading volume to demonstrate that the fair values used are appropriate for these investments. our fair value processes include controls that are designed to ensure appropriate fair values are recorded. these controls include model validation, review of key model inputs, analysis of period-over-period fluctuations, and independent recalculation of prices where appropriate.  cash flows  fiscal year 2013 compared with fiscal year 2012  cash flows from operations decreased $2.8 billion during the current fiscal year to $28.8 billion, due mainly to changes in working capital, including increases in inventory and other current assets. cash used for financing decreased $1.3 billion to $8.1 billion, due mainly to a $3.5 billion increase in proceeds from issuances of debt, net of repayments, offset in part by a $1.1 billion increase in dividends paid and a $982 million decrease in proceeds from the issuance of common stock. cash used in investing decreased $975 million to $23.8 billion, due mainly to an $8.5\u00a0billion decrease in cash used for acquisitions of companies and purchases of intangible and other assets, offset in part by a $5.8 billion increase in cash used for net investment purchases, maturities, and sales and a $2.0 billion increase in cash used for additions to property and equipment.  fiscal year 2012 compared with fiscal year 2011  cash flows from operations increased $4.6 billion during fiscal year 2012 to $31.6 billion, due mainly to increased revenue and cash collections from customers. cash used for financing increased $1.0 billion to $9.4 billion, due mainly to a $6.0 billion net decrease in proceeds from issuances of debt and a $1.2 billion increase in dividends paid, offset in part by a $6.5 billion decrease in cash used for common stock repurchases. cash used in investing increased $10.2 billion to $24.8 billion, due mainly to a $10.0 billion increase in acquisitions of businesses and purchases of intangible assets and a $1.4 billion decrease in cash from securities lending activities, partially offset by a $1.2 billion decrease in cash used for net purchases, maturities, and sales of investments.  \u00a0 38  table of contents  \u00a0 part ii  item 7  \u00a0 debt  we issued debt to take advantage of favorable pricing and liquidity in the debt markets, reflecting our credit rating and the low interest rate environment. the proceeds of these issuances were or will be used for general corporate purposes, which may include, among other things, funding for working capital, capital expenditures, repurchases of capital stock, acquisitions, and repayment of existing debt.  as of june\u00a030, 2013, the total carrying value and estimated fair value of our long-term debt, including the current portion, were $15.6 billion and $15.8 billion, respectively. this is compared to a carrying value and estimated fair value of $11.9 billion and $13.2 billion, respectively, as of june\u00a030, 2012. these estimated fair values are based on level\u00a02 inputs.  the components of our long-term debt, including the current portion, and the associated interest rates were as follows as of june\u00a030, 2013:  \u00a0 \u00a0 interest on the notes is paid semi-annually, except for the euro-denominated debt securities on which interest is paid annually. as of june\u00a030, 2013, the aggregate unamortized discount for our long-term debt, including the current portion, was $65 million.  notes  the notes are senior unsecured obligations and rank equally with our other unsecured and unsubordinated debt outstanding.  \u00a0 39  table of contents  \u00a0 part ii  item 7  \u00a0 convertible debt  in june 2013, we paid cash of $1.25 billion for the principal amount of our zero coupon convertible unsecured debt and elected to deliver cash for the $96 million excess obligation resulting from the conversion of the notes. each $1,000 principal amount of notes was convertible into 30.68 shares of microsoft common stock at a conversion price of $32.59 per share. as of june\u00a030, 2012, the net carrying amount of the convertible debt and the unamortized discount were $1.2 billion and $19 million, respectively.  in connection with the issuance of the notes in 2010, we entered into capped call transactions with certain option counterparties with a strike price equal to the conversion price of the notes. upon conversion of the notes in june 2013, we exercised the capped calls. the bulk of the capped calls were physically settled by acquiring 29\u00a0million shares of our own common stock for $938 million. the remaining capped calls were net cash settled for $24 million.  credit facility  in june 2013, we established a commercial paper program for the issuance and sale of up to $1.3 billion in commercial paper. as of june\u00a030, 2013, we have not issued any commercial paper under this program.  in june 2013, we entered into a $1.3 billion credit facility, which will serve as a back-up for our commercial paper program. as of june\u00a030, 2013, we were in compliance with the only financial covenant in the credit agreement, which requires us to maintain a coverage ratio of at least three times earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization to interest expense, as defined in the credit agreement. the credit facility expires on june\u00a024, 2018. no amounts were drawn against the credit facility since its inception.  unearned revenue  unearned revenue at june\u00a030, 2013 comprised mainly unearned revenue from volume licensing programs. unearned revenue from volume licensing programs represents customer billings for multi-year licensing arrangements paid for either at inception of the agreement or annually at the beginning of each coverage period and accounted for as subscriptions with revenue recognized ratably over the coverage period. unearned revenue at june\u00a030, 2013 also included payments for: post-delivery support and consulting services to be performed in the future; xbox live subscriptions and prepaid points; oem minimum commitments; microsoft dynamics business solutions products; skype prepaid credits and subscriptions; and other offerings for which we have been paid in advance and earn the revenue when we provide the service or software, or otherwise meet the revenue recognition criteria.  the following table outlines the expected future recognition of unearned revenue as of june\u00a030, 2013:  \u00a0 share repurchases  on september\u00a022, 2008, we announced that our board of directors approved a new share repurchase program authorizing up to $40.0 billion in share repurchases with an expiration date of september\u00a030, 2013. as of june\u00a030, 2013, approximately $3.6 billion remained of the $40.0 billion approved repurchase amount. the repurchase program may be suspended or discontinued at any time without notice.  \u00a0 40  table of contents  \u00a0 part ii  item 7  \u00a0 during the periods reported, we repurchased with cash resources: 158\u00a0million shares for $4.6 billion during fiscal year 2013; 142\u00a0million shares for $4.0 billion during fiscal year 2012; and 447\u00a0million shares for $11.5 billion during fiscal year 2011.  dividends  during fiscal years 2013 and 2012, our board of directors declared the following dividends:  \u00a0  off-balance sheet arrangements  we provide indemnifications of varying scope and size to certain customers against claims of intellectual property infringement made by third parties arising from the use of our products and certain other matters. in evaluating estimated losses on these indemnifications, we consider factors such as the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and our ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss. these obligations did not have a material impact on our financial statements during the periods presented.  contractual obligations  the following table summarizes the payments due by fiscal year for our outstanding contractual obligations as of june\u00a030, 2013:  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 41  table of contents  \u00a0 part ii  item 7  \u00a0 other planned uses of capital  we will continue to invest in sales, marketing, product support infrastructure, and existing and advanced areas of technology. additions to property and equipment will continue, including new facilities, data centers, and computer systems for research and development, sales and marketing, support, and administrative staff. we expect capital expenditures to increase in coming years in support of our cloud and devices strategy. we have operating leases for most u.s. and international sales and support offices and certain equipment. we have not engaged in any related party transactions or arrangements with unconsolidated entities or other persons that are reasonably likely to materially affect liquidity or the availability of capital resources.  liquidity  we earn a significant amount of our operating income outside the u.s., which is deemed to be permanently reinvested in foreign jurisdictions. as a result, as discussed above under cash, cash equivalents, and investments, the majority of our cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments are held by foreign subsidiaries. we currently do not intend nor foresee a need to repatriate these funds. we expect existing domestic cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, and cash flows from operations to continue to be sufficient to fund our domestic operating activities and cash commitments for investing and financing activities, such as regular quarterly dividends, debt repayment schedules, and material capital expenditures, for at least the next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future. in addition, we expect existing foreign cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, and cash flows from operations to continue to be sufficient to fund our foreign operating activities and cash commitments for investing activities, such as material capital expenditures, for at least the next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future.  should we require more capital in the u.s. than is generated by our operations domestically, for example to fund significant discretionary activities, such as business acquisitions and share repurchases, we could elect to repatriate future earnings from foreign jurisdictions or raise capital in the u.s. through debt or equity issuances. these alternatives could result in higher effective tax rates, increased interest expense, or dilution of our earnings. we have borrowed funds domestically and continue to believe we have the ability to do so at reasonable interest rates.  recent accounting guidance  recently adopted accounting guidance  in september 2011, the financial accounting standards board (\u0093fasb\u0094) issued guidance on testing goodwill for impairment. the new guidance provides an entity the option to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. if an entity determines that this is the case, it is required to perform the two-step goodwill impairment test to identify potential goodwill impairment and measure the amount of goodwill impairment loss to be recognized for that reporting unit (if any). if an entity determines that the fair value of a reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount, the two-step goodwill impairment test is not required. we adopted this new guidance beginning july\u00a01, 2012. adoption of this new guidance did not have a material impact on our financial statements.  in june 2011, the fasb issued guidance on presentation of comprehensive income.\u00a0the new guidance eliminated the option to report other comprehensive income (\u0093oci\u0094) and its components in the statement of changes in stockholders\u0092 equity.\u00a0instead, an entity is required to present either a continuous statement of net income and oci or in two separate but consecutive statements.\u00a0we adopted this new guidance beginning july\u00a01, 2012. adoption of this new guidance resulted only in changes to presentation of our financial statements.  \u00a0 42  table of contents  \u00a0 part ii  item 7  \u00a0 recent accounting guidance not yet adopted  in december 2011, the fasb issued guidance enhancing disclosure requirements about the nature of an entity\u0092s right to offset and related arrangements associated with its financial instruments and derivative instruments. the new guidance requires the disclosure of the gross amounts subject to rights of set-off, amounts offset in accordance with the accounting standards followed, and the related net exposure. in january 2013, the fasb clarified that the scope of this guidance applies to derivatives, including bifurcated embedded derivatives, repurchase agreements and reverse repurchase agreements, and securities borrowing and securities lending transactions that are either offset or subject to an enforceable master netting arrangement, or similar agreements. the new guidance will be effective for us beginning july\u00a01, 2013. other than requiring additional disclosures, we do not anticipate material impacts on our financial statements upon adoption.  in february 2013, the fasb issued guidance on disclosure requirements for items reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income (\u0093aoci\u0094). this new guidance requires entities to present (either on the face of the income statement or in the notes) the effects on the line items of the income statement for amounts reclassified out of aoci. the new guidance will be effective for us beginning july\u00a01, 2013. other than requiring additional disclosures, we do not anticipate material impacts on our financial statements upon adoption.  in march 2013, the fasb issued guidance on a parent\u0092s accounting for the cumulative translation adjustment upon derecognition of a subsidiary or group of assets within a foreign entity. this new guidance requires that the parent release any related cumulative translation adjustment into net income only if the sale or transfer results in the complete or substantially complete liquidation of the foreign entity in which the subsidiary or group of assets had resided. the new guidance will be effective for us beginning july\u00a01, 2014. we do not anticipate material impacts on our financial statements upon adoption.  application of critical accounting policies  our financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with u.s. gaap. preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. these estimates and assumptions are affected by management\u0092s application of accounting policies. critical accounting policies for us include revenue recognition, impairment of investment securities, goodwill, research and development costs, contingencies, income taxes, and inventories.  revenue recognition  revenue recognition requires judgment, including whether a software arrangement includes multiple elements, and if so, whether the vendor-specific objective evidence (\u0093vsoe\u0094) of fair value exists for those elements. a portion of revenue may be recorded as unearned due to undelivered elements. changes to the elements in a software arrangement, the ability to identify the vsoe for those elements, and the fair value of the respective elements could materially impact the amount of earned and unearned revenue. judgment is also required to assess whether future releases of certain software represent new products or upgrades and enhancements to existing products. certain volume licensing arrangements include a perpetual license for current products combined with rights to receive unspecified future versions of software products (\u0093software assurance\u0094) and are accounted for as subscriptions, with billings recorded as unearned revenue and recognized as revenue ratably over the coverage period.  software updates are evaluated on a case-by-case basis to determine whether they meet the definition of an upgrade, which may require revenue to be deferred and recognized when the upgrade is delivered, or if it is determined that implied post-contract customer support (\u0093pcs\u0094) is being provided, revenue from the arrangement is deferred and recognized over the implied pcs term. if updates are determined to not meet the definition of an upgrade, revenue is generally recognized as products are shipped or made available.  windows 8.1 will enable new hardware, further the integration with other microsoft services and address customer issues with windows 8, and will be provided to windows 8 customers when available at no additional charge. we evaluated windows 8.1 and determined that it did not meet the definition of an upgrade and thus have not deferred revenue related to this planned release.  \u00a0 43  table of contents  \u00a0 part ii  item 7  \u00a0 windows 7 revenue was subject to deferral as a result of the windows upgrade offer, which started june\u00a02, 2012. the offer provided significantly discounted rights to purchase windows 8 pro to qualifying end-users that purchased windows 7 pcs during the eligibility period. microsoft was responsible for delivering windows 8 pro to the end customer. accordingly, revenue related to the allocated discount for undelivered windows 8 was deferred until it was delivered or the redemption period expired.  microsoft office system revenue was subject to deferral as a result of the office upgrade offer, which started october\u00a019, 2012. the office upgrade offer allowed customers who purchased qualifying 2010 microsoft office system or office for mac 2011 products to receive, at no cost, a one-year subscription to office 365 home premium or the equivalent version of 2013 microsoft office system upon general availability. small business customers in applicable markets were also eligible for a three-month trial of office 365 small business premium. accordingly, estimated revenue related to the undelivered 2013 microsoft office system and subscription services was deferred until the products and services were delivered or the redemption period expired.  impairment of investment securities  we review investments quarterly for indicators of other-than-temporary impairment. this determination requires significant judgment. in making this judgment, we employ a systematic methodology quarterly that considers available quantitative and qualitative evidence in evaluating potential impairment of our investments. if the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value, we evaluate, among other factors, general market conditions, credit quality of debt instrument issuers, the duration and extent to which the fair value is less than cost, and for equity securities, our intent and ability to hold, or plans to sell, the investment. for fixed-income securities, we also evaluate whether we have plans to sell the security or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery. we also consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of and business outlook for the investee, including industry and sector performance, changes in technology, and operational and financing cash flow factors. once a decline in fair value is determined to be other-than-temporary, an impairment charge is recorded to other income (expense) and a new cost basis in the investment is established. if market, industry, and/or investee conditions deteriorate, we may incur future impairments.  goodwill  we allocate goodwill to reporting units based on the reporting unit expected to benefit from the business combination. we evaluate our reporting units on an annual basis and, if necessary, reassign goodwill using a relative fair value allocation approach. goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level (operating segment or one level below an operating segment) on an annual basis (may 1 for us) and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. these events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate, legal factors, operating performance indicators, competition, or sale or disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit.  application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment, including the identification of reporting units, assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units, assignment of goodwill to reporting units, and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit. the fair value of each reporting unit is estimated using a discounted cash flow methodology. this analysis requires significant judgments, including estimation of future cash flows, which is dependent on internal forecasts, estimation of the long-term rate of growth for our business, estimation of the useful life over which cash flows will occur, and determination of our weighted average cost of capital.  the estimates used to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit change from year to year based on operating results, market conditions, and other factors. changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and goodwill impairment for each reporting unit.  research and development costs  costs incurred internally in researching and developing a computer software product are charged to expense until technological feasibility has been established for the product. once technological feasibility is established, all  \u00a0 44  table of contents  \u00a0 part ii  item 7  \u00a0  software costs are capitalized until the product is available for general release to customers. judgment is required in determining when technological feasibility of a product is established. we have determined that technological feasibility for our software products is reached after all high-risk development issues have been resolved through coding and testing. generally, this occurs shortly before the products are released to manufacturing. the amortization of these costs is included in cost of revenue over the estimated life of the products.  legal and other contingencies  the outcomes of legal proceedings and claims brought against us are subject to significant uncertainty. an estimated loss from a loss contingency such as a legal proceeding or claim is accrued by a charge to income if it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. disclosure of a contingency is required if there is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss has been incurred. in determining whether a loss should be accrued we evaluate, among other factors, the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss. changes in these factors could materially impact our financial statements.  income taxes  the objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entity\u0092s financial statements or tax returns. we recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. accounting literature also provides guidance on derecognition of income tax assets and liabilities, classification of current and deferred income tax assets and liabilities, accounting for interest and penalties associated with tax positions, and income tax disclosures. judgment is required in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns. variations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could materially impact our financial statements.  inventories  inventories are stated at average cost, subject to the lower of cost or market. cost includes materials, labor, and manufacturing overhead related to the purchase and production of inventories. we regularly review inventory quantities on hand, future purchase commitments with our suppliers, and the estimated utility of our inventory. these reviews include analysis of demand forecasts, product life cycle status, product development plans, current sales levels, pricing strategy, and component cost trends. if our review indicates a reduction in utility below carrying value, we reduce our inventory to a new cost basis through a charge to cost of revenue. the determination of market value and the estimated volume of demand used in the lower of cost or market analysis require significant judgment.  \u00a0 45  table of contents  \u00a0 part ii  item 7  \u00a0 statement of management\u0092s responsibility for financial statements  management is responsible for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements and related information that are presented in this report. the consolidated financial statements, which include amounts based on management\u0092s estimates and judgments, have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america.  the company designs and maintains accounting and internal control systems to provide reasonable assurance at reasonable cost that assets are safeguarded against loss from unauthorized use or disposition, and that the financial records are reliable for preparing financial statements and maintaining accountability for assets. these systems are augmented by written policies, an organizational structure providing division of responsibilities, careful selection and training of qualified personnel, and a program of internal audits.  the company engaged deloitte\u00a0& touche llp, an independent registered public accounting firm, to audit and render an opinion on the consolidated financial statements and internal control over financial reporting in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board (united states).  the board of directors, through its audit committee, consisting solely of independent directors of the company, meets periodically with management, internal auditors, and our independent registered public accounting firm to ensure that each is meeting its responsibilities and to discuss matters concerning internal controls and financial reporting. deloitte\u00a0& touche llp and the internal auditors each have full and free access to the audit committee.  \u00a0 46  table of contents  \u00a0 part ii  item 7a  \u00a0 item\u00a07a.\u00a0quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk  risks  we are exposed to economic risk from foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, credit risk, equity prices, and commodity prices. a portion of these risks is hedged, but they may impact our financial statements.  foreign currency  certain forecasted transactions, assets, and liabilities are exposed to foreign currency risk. we monitor our foreign currency exposures daily and use hedges where practicable to offset the risks and maximize the economic effectiveness of our foreign currency positions. principal currencies hedged include the euro, japanese yen, british pound, and canadian dollar.  interest rate  our fixed-income portfolio is diversified across credit sectors and maturities, consisting primarily of investment-grade securities. the credit risk and average maturity of the fixed-income portfolio is managed to achieve economic returns that correlate to certain global and domestic fixed-income indices. in addition, we use \u0093to be announced\u0094 forward purchase commitments of mortgage-backed assets to gain exposure to agency and mortgage-backed securities.  equity  our equity portfolio consists of global, developed, and emerging market securities that are subject to market price risk. we manage the securities relative to certain global and domestic indices and expect their economic risk and return to correlate with these indices.  commodity  we use broad-based commodity exposures to enhance portfolio returns and facilitate portfolio diversification. our investment portfolio has exposure to a variety of commodities, including precious metals, energy, and grain. we manage these exposures relative to global commodity indices and expect their economic risk and return to correlate with these indices.  value-at-risk  we use a value-at-risk (\u0093var\u0094) model to estimate and quantify our market risks. var is the expected loss, for a given confidence level, in the fair value of our portfolio due to adverse market movements over a defined time horizon. the var model is not intended to represent actual losses in fair value, including determinations of other-than-temporary losses in fair value in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states (\u0093u.s. gaap\u0094), but is used as a risk estimation and management tool. the distribution of the potential changes in total market value of all holdings is computed based on the historical volatilities and correlations among foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, equity prices, and commodity prices, assuming normal market conditions.  the var is calculated as the total loss that will not be exceeded at the 97.5 percentile confidence level or, alternatively stated, the losses could exceed the var in 25 out of 1,000 cases. several risk factors are not captured in the model, including liquidity risk, operational risk, and legal risk.  \u00a0 47  table of contents  \u00a0 part ii  item 7a  \u00a0 the following table sets forth the one-day var for substantially all of our positions as of june\u00a030, 2013 and 2012 and for the year ended june\u00a030, 2013:  \u00a0  total one-day var for the combined risk categories was $350 million at june\u00a030, 2013 and $292 million at june\u00a030, 2012. the total var is 28% less at june\u00a030, 2013, and 26% less at june\u00a030, 2012, than the sum of the separate risk categories in the above table due to the diversification benefit of the combination of risks.  \u00a0 48  table of contents  \u00a0 part ii  item 8  \u00a0 comprehensive income statements  \u00a0 see accompanying notes.  \u00a0 50  table of

statements  note 1 - accounting policies  accounting principles  the financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america (\u0093u.s. gaap\u0094).  principles of consolidation  the financial statements include the accounts of microsoft corporation and its subsidiaries. intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated. equity investments through which we exercise significant influence over but do not control the investee and are not the primary beneficiary of the investee\u0092s activities are accounted for using the equity method. investments through which we are not able to exercise significant influence over the investee and which do not have readily determinable fair values are accounted for under the cost method.  estimates and assumptions  preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. examples of estimates include: loss contingencies; product warranties; the fair value of, and/or potential goodwill impairment for, our reporting units; product life cycles; useful lives of our tangible and intangible assets; allowances for doubtful accounts; allowances for product returns; the market value of our inventory; and stock-based compensation forfeiture rates. examples of assumptions include: the elements comprising a software arrangement, including the distinction between upgrades or enhancements and new products; when technological feasibility is achieved for our products; the potential outcome of future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns; and determining when investment impairments are other-than-temporary. actual results and outcomes may differ from management\u0092s estimates and assumptions.  foreign currencies  assets and liabilities recorded in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rate on the balance sheet date. revenue and expenses are translated at average rates of exchange prevailing during the year. translation adjustments resulting from this process are recorded to other comprehensive income (\u0093oci\u0094).  revenue recognition  revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the fee is fixed or determinable, and collectibility is probable. revenue generally is recognized net of allowances for returns and any taxes collected from customers and subsequently remitted to governmental authorities.  revenue for retail packaged products, products licensed to original equipment manufacturers (\u0093oems\u0094), and perpetual licenses under certain volume licensing programs generally is recognized as products are shipped or made available.  technology guarantee programs are accounted for as multiple element arrangements as customers receive free or significantly discounted rights to use upcoming new versions of a software product if they license existing versions of the product during the eligibility period. revenue is allocated between the existing product and the new product, and revenue allocated to the new product is deferred until that version is delivered. the revenue allocation is based on the vendor-specific objective evidence (\u0093vsoe\u0094) of fair value of the products. the vsoe of fair value for upcoming new products are based on the price determined by management having the relevant authority when the element is not yet sold separately, but is expected to be sold in the near future at the price set by management.  \u00a0 54  table of contents  \u00a0 part ii  item 8  \u00a0 software updates that will be provided free of charge are evaluated on a case-by-case basis to determine whether they meet the definition of an upgrade and create a multiple element arrangement, which may require revenue to be deferred and recognized when the upgrade is delivered, or if it is determined that implied post-contract customer support (\u0093pcs\u0094) is being provided, the arrangement is accounted for as a multiple element arrangement and all revenue from the arrangement is deferred and recognized over the implied pcs term when the vsoe of fair value does not exist. if updates are determined to not meet the definition of an upgrade, revenue is generally recognized as products are shipped or made available. windows 8.1 will enable new hardware, further the integration with other microsoft services and fix some of the customer issues with windows 8, and will be provided to windows 8 customers when available at no additional charge.\u00a0we evaluated windows 8.1 and determined that it did not meet the definition of an upgrade and thus have not deferred revenue related to this planned release.  certain volume licensing arrangements include a perpetual license for current products combined with rights to receive unspecified future versions of software products (\u0093software assurance\u0094), which we have determined are additional software products and are therefore accounted for as subscriptions, with billings recorded as unearned revenue and recognized as revenue ratably over the coverage period. arrangements that include term based licenses for current products with the right to use unspecified future versions of the software during the coverage period, are also accounted for as subscriptions, with revenue recognized ratably over the coverage period.  revenue from cloud-based services arrangements that allow for the use of a hosted software product or service over a contractually determined period of time without taking possession of software are accounted for as subscriptions with billings recorded as unearned revenue and recognized as revenue ratably over the coverage period beginning on the date the service is made available to customers. revenue from cloud-based services arrangements that are provided on a consumption basis (for example, the amount of storage used in a particular period) is recognized commensurate with the customer utilization of such resources.  some volume licensing arrangements include time-based subscriptions for cloud-based services and software offerings that are accounted for as subscriptions. these arrangements are considered multiple element arrangements. however, because all elements are accounted for as subscriptions and have the same coverage period and delivery pattern, they have the same revenue recognition timing.  revenue related to surface, our xbox 360 gaming and entertainment console, kinect for xbox 360, games published by us, and other hardware components is generally recognized when ownership is transferred to the resellers or end customers when selling directly through microsoft stores. revenue related to games published by third parties for use on the xbox 360 platform is recognized when games are manufactured by the game publishers.  display advertising revenue is recognized as advertisements are displayed. search advertising revenue is recognized when the ad appears in the search results or when the action necessary to earn the revenue has been completed. consulting services revenue is recognized as services are rendered, generally based on the negotiated hourly rate in the consulting arrangement and the number of hours worked during the period. consulting revenue for fixed-price services arrangements is recognized as services are provided. revenue from prepaid points redeemable for the purchase of software or services is recognized upon redemption of the points and delivery of the software or services.  cost of revenue  cost of revenue includes: manufacturing and distribution costs for products sold and programs licensed; operating costs related to product support service centers and product distribution centers; costs incurred to include software on pcs sold by oems, to drive traffic to our websites, and to acquire online advertising space (\u0093traffic acquisition costs\u0094); costs incurred to support and maintain internet-based products and services, including datacenter costs and royalties; warranty costs; inventory valuation adjustments; costs associated with the delivery of consulting services; and the amortization of capitalized research and development costs. capitalized research and development costs are amortized over the estimated lives of the products.  \u00a0 55  table of contents  \u00a0 part ii  item 8  \u00a0 product warranty  we provide for the estimated costs of fulfilling our obligations under hardware and software warranties at the time the related revenue is recognized. for hardware warranties, we estimate the costs based on historical and projected product failure rates, historical and projected repair costs, and knowledge of specific product failures (if any). the specific hardware warranty terms and conditions vary depending upon the product sold and the country in which we do business, but generally include parts and labor over a period generally ranging from 90\u00a0days to three years. for software warranties, we estimate the costs to provide bug fixes, such as security patches, over the estimated life of the software. we regularly reevaluate our estimates to assess the adequacy of the recorded warranty liabilities and adjust the amounts as necessary.  research and development  research and development expenses include payroll, employee benefits, stock-based compensation expense, and other headcount-related expenses associated with product development. research and development expenses also include third-party development and programming costs, localization costs incurred to translate software for international markets, and the amortization of purchased software code and services content. such costs related to software development are included in research and development expense until the point that technological feasibility is reached, which for our software products, is generally shortly before the products are released to manufacturing. once technological feasibility is reached, such costs are capitalized and amortized to cost of revenue over the estimated lives of the products.  sales and marketing  sales and marketing expenses include payroll, employee benefits, stock-based compensation expense, and other headcount-related expenses associated with sales and marketing personnel, and the costs of advertising, promotions, trade shows, seminars, and other programs. advertising costs are expensed as incurred. advertising expense was $2.6 billion, $1.6 billion, and $1.9 billion in fiscal years 2013, 2012, and 2011, respectively.  stock-based compensation  we measure stock-based compensation cost at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and recognize it as expense, net of estimated forfeitures, over the vesting or service period, as applicable, of the stock award (generally four to five years) using the straight-line method.  employee stock purchase plan  shares of our common stock may be purchased by employees at three-month intervals at 90% of the fair market value of the stock on the last day of each three-month period. compensation expense for the employee stock purchase plan is measured as the discount the employee is entitled to upon purchase and is recognized in the period of purchase.  income taxes  income tax expense includes u.s. and international income taxes, the provision for u.s. taxes on undistributed earnings of international subsidiaries not deemed to be permanently invested, and interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions. certain income and expenses are not reported in tax returns and financial statements in the same year. the tax effect of such temporary differences is reported as deferred income taxes. deferred tax assets are reported net of a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized. the deferred income taxes are classified as current or long-term based on the classification of the related asset or liability.  \u00a0 56  table of contents  \u00a0 part ii  item 8  \u00a0 fair value measurements  we account for certain assets and liabilities at fair value. the hierarchy below lists three levels of fair value based on the extent to which inputs used in measuring fair value are observable in the market.\u00a0we categorize each of our fair value measurements in one of these three levels based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. these levels are:  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 we measure certain assets, including our cost and equity method investments, at fair value on a nonrecurring basis when they are deemed to be other-than-temporarily impaired. the fair values of these investments are determined based on valuation techniques using the best information available, and may include quoted market prices, market comparables, and discounted cash flow projections. an impairment charge is recorded when the cost of the investment exceeds its fair value and this condition is determined to be other-than-temporary.  our other current financial assets and our current financial liabilities have fair values that approximate their carrying values.  financial instruments  we consider all highly liquid interest-earning investments with a maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase to be cash equivalents. the fair values of these investments approximate their carrying values. in general, investments with original maturities of greater than three months and remaining maturities of less than one year are classified as short-term investments. investments with maturities beyond one year may be classified as short-term based on their highly liquid nature and because such marketable securities represent the investment of cash that is available for current operations. all cash equivalents and short-term investments are classified as available-for-sale and realized gains and losses are recorded using the specific identification method. changes in market value, excluding other-than-temporary impairments, are reflected in oci.  equity and other investments classified as long-term include both debt and equity instruments. debt and publicly-traded equity securities are classified as available-for-sale and realized gains and losses are recorded using the  \u00a0 57  table of contents  \u00a0 part ii  item 8  \u00a0  specific identification method. changes in market value, excluding other-than-temporary impairments, are reflected in oci. common and preferred stock and other investments that are restricted for more than one year or are not publicly traded are recorded at cost or using the equity method.  we lend certain fixed-income and equity securities to increase investment returns. the loaned securities continue to be carried as investments on our balance sheet. cash and/or security interests are received as collateral for the loaned securities with the amount determined based upon the underlying security lent and the creditworthiness of the borrower. cash received is recorded as an asset with a corresponding liability.  investments are considered to be impaired when a decline in fair value is judged to be other-than-temporary. fair value is calculated based on publicly available market information or other estimates determined by management. we employ a systematic methodology on a quarterly basis that considers available quantitative and qualitative evidence in evaluating potential impairment of our investments. if the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value, we evaluate, among other factors, general market conditions, credit quality of debt instrument issuers, the duration and extent to which the fair value is less than cost, and for equity securities, our intent and ability to hold, or plans to sell, the investment. for fixed-income securities, we also evaluate whether we have plans to sell the security or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery. we also consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of and business outlook for the investee, including industry and sector performance, changes in technology, and operational and financing cash flow factors. once a decline in fair value is determined to be other-than-temporary, an impairment charge is recorded to other income (expense) and a new cost basis in the investment is established.  derivative instruments are recognized as either assets or liabilities and are measured at fair value. the accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation.  for derivative instruments designated as fair-value hedges, the gains (losses) are recognized in earnings in the periods of change together with the offsetting losses (gains) on the hedged items attributed to the risk being hedged. for options designated as fair-value hedges, changes in the time value are excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and are recognized in earnings.  for derivative instruments designated as cash-flow hedges, the effective portion of the gains (losses) on the derivatives is initially reported as a component of oci and is subsequently recognized in earnings when the hedged exposure is recognized in earnings. for options designated as cash-flow hedges, changes in the time value are excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and are recognized in earnings. gains (losses) on derivatives representing either hedge components excluded from the assessment of effectiveness or hedge ineffectiveness are recognized in earnings.  for derivative instruments that are not designated as hedges, gains (losses) from changes in fair values are primarily recognized in other income (expense). other than those derivatives entered into for investment purposes, such as commodity contracts, the gains (losses) are generally economically offset by unrealized gains (losses) in the underlying available-for-sale securities, which are recorded as a component of oci until the securities are sold or other-than-temporarily impaired, at which time the amounts are reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income (\u0093aoci\u0094) into other income (expense).  \u00a0 58  table of contents  \u00a0 part ii  item 8  \u00a0 allowance for doubtful accounts  the allowance for doubtful accounts reflects our best estimate of probable losses inherent in the accounts receivable balance. we determine the allowance based on known troubled accounts, historical experience, and other currently available evidence. activity in the allowance for doubtful accounts was as follows:  \u00a0 inventories  inventories are stated at average cost, subject to the lower of cost or market. cost includes materials, labor, and manufacturing overhead related to the purchase and production of inventories. we regularly review inventory quantities on hand, future purchase commitments with our suppliers, and the estimated utility of our inventory. if our review indicates a reduction in utility below carrying value, we reduce our inventory to a new cost basis through a charge to cost of revenue.  property and equipment  property and equipment is stated at cost and depreciated using the straight-line method over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the asset or the lease term. the estimated useful lives of our property and equipment are generally as follows: computer software developed or acquired for internal use, three years; computer equipment, two to three years; buildings and improvements, five to 15 years; leasehold improvements, two to 10 years; and furniture and equipment, one to five years. land is not depreciated.  goodwill  goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level (operating segment or one level below an operating segment) on an annual basis (may 1 for us) and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value.  intangible assets  all of our intangible assets are subject to amortization and are amortized using the straight-line method over their estimated period of benefit, ranging from one to 15 years. we evaluate the recoverability of intangible assets periodically by taking into account events or circumstances that may warrant revised estimates of useful lives or that indicate the asset may be impaired.  recent accounting guidance  recently adopted accounting guidance  in september 2011, the financial accounting standards board (\u0093fasb\u0094) issued guidance on testing goodwill for impairment. the new guidance provides an entity the option to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. if an entity determines that this is the case, it is required to perform the two-step goodwill impairment test to identify potential goodwill impairment and measure the amount of goodwill impairment loss to be recognized for that reporting unit (if any). if an entity determines that the fair value of a reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount, the two-step goodwill impairment test is not required. we adopted this new guidance beginning july\u00a01, 2012. adoption of this new guidance did not have a material impact on our financial statements.  \u00a0 59  table of contents  \u00a0 part ii  item 8  \u00a0 in june 2011, the fasb issued guidance on presentation of comprehensive income.\u00a0the new guidance eliminated the option to report oci and its components in the statement of changes in stockholders\u0092 equity.\u00a0instead, an entity is required to present either a continuous statement of net income and oci or in two separate but consecutive statements.\u00a0we adopted this new guidance beginning july\u00a01, 2012. adoption of this new guidance resulted only in changes to presentation of our financial statements.  recent accounting guidance not yet adopted  in december 2011, the fasb issued guidance enhancing disclosure requirements about the nature of an entity\u0092s right to offset and related arrangements associated with its financial instruments and derivative instruments. the new guidance requires the disclosure of the gross amounts subject to rights of set-off, amounts offset in accordance with the accounting standards followed, and the related net exposure. in january 2013, the fasb clarified that the scope of this guidance applies to derivatives, including bifurcated embedded derivatives, repurchase agreements and reverse repurchase agreements, and securities borrowing and securities lending transactions that are either offset or subject to an enforceable master netting arrangement, or similar agreements. the new guidance will be effective for us beginning july\u00a01, 2013. other than requiring additional disclosures, we do not anticipate material impacts on our financial statements upon adoption.  in february 2013, the fasb issued guidance on disclosure requirements for items reclassified out of aoci. this new guidance requires entities to present (either on the face of the income statement or in the notes) the effects on the line items of the income statement for amounts reclassified out of aoci. the new guidance will be effective for us beginning july\u00a01, 2013. other than requiring additional disclosures, we do not anticipate material impacts on our financial statements upon adoption.  in march 2013, the fasb issued guidance on a parent\u0092s accounting for the cumulative translation adjustment upon derecognition of a subsidiary or group of assets within a foreign entity. this new guidance requires that the parent release any related cumulative translation adjustment into net income only if the sale or transfer results in the complete or substantially complete liquidation of the foreign entity in which the subsidiary or group of assets had resided. the new guidance will be effective for us beginning july\u00a01, 2014. we do not anticipate material impacts on our financial statements upon adoption.  note 2 - earnings per share  basic earnings per share (\u0093eps\u0094) is computed based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. diluted eps is computed based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock plus the effect of dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period using the treasury stock method. dilutive potential common shares include outstanding stock options, stock awards, and shared performance stock awards.  the components of basic and diluted eps are as follows:  \u00a0 anti-dilutive stock-based awards excluded from the calculations of diluted eps were immaterial during the periods presented.  \u00a0 60  table of contents  \u00a0 part ii  item 8  \u00a0 note 3 - other income (expense)  the components of other income (expense) were as follows:  \u00a0 following are details of net recognized gains (losses) on investments during the periods reported:  \u00a0 note 4 - investments  investment components  the components of investments, including associated derivatives, were as follows:  \u00a0 \u00a0 61  table of contents  \u00a0 part ii  item 8  \u00a0 unrealized losses on investments  investments with continuous unrealized losses for less than 12 months and 12 months or greater and their related fair values were as follows:  \u00a0 \u00a0 unrealized losses from fixed-income securities are primarily attributable to changes in interest rates. unrealized losses from domestic and international equities are due to market price movements. management does not believe any remaining unrealized losses represent other-than-temporary impairments based on our evaluation of available evidence as of june\u00a030, 2013.  \u00a0 62  table of contents  \u00a0 part ii  item 8  \u00a0 at june\u00a030, 2013 and 2012, the recorded bases of common and preferred stock and other investments that are restricted for more than one year or are not publicly traded were $395 million and $313 million, respectively. these investments are carried at cost and are reviewed quarterly for indicators of other-than-temporary impairment. it is not practicable for us to reliably estimate the fair value of these investments.  debt investment maturities  \u00a0 note 5 - derivatives  we use derivative instruments to manage risks related to foreign currencies, equity prices, interest rates, and credit; to enhance investment returns; and to facilitate portfolio diversification. our objectives for holding derivatives include reducing, eliminating, and efficiently managing the economic impact of these exposures as effectively as possible.  our derivative programs include strategies that both qualify and do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment. all notional amounts presented below are measured in u.s. dollar equivalents.  foreign currency  certain forecasted transactions, assets, and liabilities are exposed to foreign currency risk. we monitor our foreign currency exposures daily to maximize the economic effectiveness of our foreign currency hedge positions. option and forward contracts are used to hedge a portion of forecasted international revenue for up to three years in the future and are designated as cash flow hedging instruments. principal currencies hedged include the euro, japanese yen, british pound, and canadian dollar. as of june\u00a030, 2013 and june\u00a030, 2012, the total notional amounts of these foreign exchange contracts sold were $5.1 billion and $6.7 billion, respectively.  foreign currency risks related to certain non-u.s. dollar denominated securities are hedged using foreign exchange forward contracts that are designated as fair value hedging instruments. as of june\u00a030, 2013 and june\u00a030, 2012, the total notional amounts of these foreign exchange contracts sold were $407 million and $1.3 billion, respectively.  certain options and forwards not designated as hedging instruments are also used to manage the variability in exchange rates on accounts receivable, cash, and intercompany positions, and to manage other foreign currency exposures.\u00a0as of june\u00a030, 2013, the total notional amounts of these foreign exchange contracts purchased and sold were $5.0 billion and $7.9 billion, respectively. as of june\u00a030, 2012, the total notional amounts of these foreign exchange contracts purchased and sold were $3.6 billion and $7.3 billion, respectively.  equity  securities held in our equity and other investments portfolio are subject to market price risk.\u00a0market price risk is managed relative to broad-based global and domestic equity indices using certain convertible preferred investments, options, futures, and swap contracts not designated as hedging instruments. from time to time, to hedge our price risk, we may use and designate equity derivatives as hedging instruments, including puts, calls, swaps, and forwards.\u00a0as of june\u00a030, 2013, the total notional amounts of designated and non-designated equity contracts  \u00a0 63  table of contents  \u00a0 part ii  item 8  \u00a0  purchased and sold were $898 million and $1.0 billion, respectively. as of june\u00a030, 2012, the total notional amounts of designated and non-designated equity contracts purchased and sold were $1.4 billion and $982 million, respectively.  interest rate  securities held in our fixed-income portfolio are subject to different interest rate risks based on their maturities. we manage the average maturity of our fixed-income portfolio to achieve economic returns that correlate to certain broad-based fixed-income indices using exchange-traded option and futures contracts and over-the-counter swap and option contracts, none of which are designated as hedging instruments. as of june\u00a030, 2013, the total notional amounts of fixed-interest rate contracts purchased and sold were $1.1 billion and $809 million, respectively. as of june\u00a030, 2012, the total notional amounts of fixed-interest rate contracts purchased and sold were $3.2 billion and $1.9 billion, respectively.  in addition, we use \u0093to be announced\u0094 forward purchase commitments of mortgage-backed assets to gain exposure to agency mortgage-backed securities.\u00a0these meet the definition of a derivative instrument in cases where physical delivery of the assets is not taken at the earliest available delivery date. as of june\u00a030, 2013 and 2012, the total notional derivative amounts of mortgage contracts purchased were $1.2 billion and $1.1 billion, respectively.  credit  our fixed-income portfolio is diversified and consists primarily of investment-grade securities. we use credit default swap contracts, not designated as hedging instruments, to manage credit exposures relative to broad-based indices and to facilitate portfolio diversification. we use credit default swaps as they are a low cost method of managing exposure to individual credit risks or groups of credit risks. as of june\u00a030, 2013, the total notional amounts of credit contracts purchased and sold were $377 million and $501 million, respectively. as of june\u00a030, 2012, the total notional amounts of credit contracts purchased and sold were $318 million and $456 million, respectively.  commodity  we use broad-based commodity exposures to enhance portfolio returns and to facilitate portfolio diversification. we use swaps, futures, and option contracts, not designated as hedging instruments, to generate and manage exposures to broad-based commodity indices. we use derivatives on commodities as they can be low-cost alternatives to the purchase and storage of a variety of commodities, including, but not limited to, precious metals, energy, and grain. as of june\u00a030, 2013, the total notional amounts of commodity contracts purchased and sold were $1.2 billion and $249 million, respectively. as of june\u00a030, 2012, the total notional amounts of commodity contracts purchased and sold were $1.5 billion and $445 million, respectively.  credit-risk-related contingent features  certain of our counterparty agreements for derivative instruments contain provisions that require our issued and outstanding long-term unsecured debt to maintain an investment grade credit rating and require us to maintain minimum liquidity of $1.0 billion. to the extent we fail to meet these requirements, we will be required to post collateral, similar to the standard convention related to over-the-counter derivatives. as of june\u00a030, 2013, our long-term unsecured debt rating was aaa, and cash investments were in excess of $1.0 billion. as a result, no collateral was required to be posted.  \u00a0 64  table of contents  \u00a0 part ii  item 8  \u00a0 fair values of derivative instruments  the following tables present the gross fair values of derivative instruments designated as hedging instruments (\u0093designated hedge derivatives\u0094) and not designated as hedging instruments (\u0093non-designated hedge derivatives\u0094). the fair values exclude the impact of netting derivative assets and liabilities when a legally enforceable master netting agreement exists and fair value adjustments related to our own credit risk and counterparty credit risk:  \u00a0 \u00a0 see also note 4 \u0096 investments and note\u00a06\u00a0\u0096 fair value measurements.  \u00a0 65  table of contents  \u00a0 part ii  item 8  \u00a0 fair value hedge gains (losses)  we recognized in other income (expense) the following gains (losses) on contracts designated as fair value hedges and their related hedged items:  \u00a0 cash flow hedge gains (losses)  we recognized the following gains (losses) on foreign exchange contracts designated as cash flow hedges (our only cash flow hedges during the periods presented):  \u00a0  we estimate that $95 million of net derivative gains included in aoci at june\u00a030, 2013 will be reclassified into earnings within the following 12 months. no significant amounts of gains (losses) were reclassified from aoci into earnings as a result of forecasted transactions that failed to occur during fiscal year 2013.  non-designated derivative gains (losses)  gains (losses) from changes in fair values of derivatives that are not designated as hedges are primarily recognized in other income (expense). these amounts are shown in the table below, with the exception of gains (losses) on derivatives presented in income statement line items other than other income (expense), which were immaterial for the periods presented. other than those derivatives entered into for investment purposes, such as commodity contracts, the gains (losses) below are generally economically offset by unrealized gains (losses) in the underlying available-for-sale securities.  \u00a0 \u00a0 66  table of contents  \u00a0 part ii  item 8  \u00a0 note 6 - fair value measurements  assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis  the following tables present the fair value of our financial instruments that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis:  \u00a0  \u00a0 the changes in our level 3 financial instruments that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis were immaterial during the periods presented.  \u00a0 67  table of contents  \u00a0 part ii  item 8  \u00a0 the following table reconciles the total net fair value of assets above to the balance sheet presentation of these same assets in note 4 \u0096 investments.  \u00a0 financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis  during fiscal year 2013 and 2012, we did not record any material other-than-temporary impairments on financial assets required to be measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis.  note 7 - inventories  the components of inventories were as follows:  \u00a0 note 8 - property and equipment  the components of property and equipment were as follows:  \u00a0 during fiscal years 2013, 2012, and 2011, depreciation expense was $2.6 billion, $2.2 billion, and $2.0 billion, respectively.  \u00a0 68  table of contents  \u00a0 part ii  item 8  \u00a0 note 9 - business combinations  yammer  on july\u00a018, 2012, we acquired yammer, inc. (\u0093yammer\u0094), a leading provider of enterprise social networks, for $1.1 billion in cash. yammer will continue to develop its standalone service and will add an enterprise social networking service to microsoft\u0092s portfolio of complementary cloud-based services. the major classes of assets to which we allocated the purchase price were goodwill of $937 million and identifiable intangible assets of $178 million. we assigned the goodwill to the microsoft business division. yammer was consolidated into our results of operations starting on the acquisition date.  skype  on october\u00a013, 2011, we acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of skype global s.\u00e1 r.l. (\u0093skype\u0094), a leading global provider of software applications and related internet communications products based in luxembourg, for $8.6 billion, primarily in cash. the major classes of assets and liabilities to which we allocated the purchase price were goodwill of $7.1 billion, identifiable intangible assets of $1.6 billion, and unearned revenue of $222 million. the goodwill recognized in connection with the acquisition is primarily attributable to our expectation of extending skype\u0092s brand and the reach of its networked platform, while enhancing microsoft\u0092s existing portfolio of real-time communications products and services. we assigned the goodwill to the following segments: $4.2 billion to entertainment and devices division, $2.8 billion to microsoft business division, and $54 million to online services division. skype was consolidated into our results of operations starting on the acquisition date.  following are the details of the purchase price allocated to the intangible assets acquired:  \u00a0 other  during fiscal year 2013, we completed 11 additional acquisitions for total consideration of $437 million, all of which was paid in cash. these entities have been included in our consolidated results of operations since their respective acquisition dates.  pro forma results of operations have not been presented because the effects of the business combinations described in this note, individually and in aggregate, were not material to our consolidated results of operations.  note 10 - goodwill  changes in the carrying amount of goodwill were as follows:  \u00a0 \u00a0 69  table of contents  \u00a0 part ii  item 8  \u00a0 the measurement periods for purchase price allocations end as soon as information on the facts and circumstances becomes available, but do not exceed 12 months. adjustments in purchase price allocations may require a recasting of the amounts allocated to goodwill retroactive to the periods in which the acquisitions occurred.  any change in the goodwill amounts resulting from foreign currency translations are presented as \u0093other\u0094 in the above table. also included within \u0093other\u0094 are business dispositions and transfers between business segments due to reorganizations, as applicable. for fiscal year 2012, a $6.2 billion goodwill impairment charge was included in \u0093other,\u0094 as discussed further below. this goodwill impairment charge also represented our accumulated goodwill impairment as of june\u00a030, 2013 and 2012.  goodwill impairment  we test goodwill for impairment annually on may\u00a01 at the reporting unit level using a discounted cash flow methodology with a peer-based, risk-adjusted weighted average cost of capital. we believe use of a discounted cash flow approach is the most reliable indicator of the fair values of the businesses.  no impairment of goodwill was identified as of may\u00a01, 2013. upon completion of the fiscal year 2012 test, osd goodwill was determined to be impaired. the impairment was the result of the osd unit experiencing slower than projected growth in search queries and search advertising revenue per query, slower growth in display revenue, and changes in the timing and implementation of certain initiatives designed to drive search and display revenue growth in the future.  because our fiscal year 2012 annual test indicated that osd\u0092s carrying value exceeded its estimated fair value, a second phase of the goodwill impairment test (\u0093step 2\u0094) was performed specific to osd. under step 2, the fair value of all osd assets and liabilities were estimated, including tangible assets, existing technology, trade names, and partner relationships for the purpose of deriving an estimate of the implied fair value of goodwill. the implied fair value of the goodwill was then compared to the recorded goodwill to determine the amount of the impairment. assumptions used in measuring the value of these assets and liabilities included the discount rates, royalty rates, and obsolescence rates used in valuing the intangible assets, and pricing of comparable transactions in the market in valuing the tangible assets.  no other instances of impairment were identified in our may\u00a01, 2012 test.  note 11 - intangible assets  the components of intangible assets, all of which are finite-lived, were as follows:  \u00a0 \u00a0 we estimate that we have no significant residual value related to our intangible assets. no material impairments of intangible assets were identified during any of the periods presented.  \u00a0 70  table of contents  \u00a0 part ii  item 8  \u00a0 the components of intangible assets acquired during the periods presented were as follows:  \u00a0 intangible assets amortization expense was $739 million, $558 million, and $537 million for fiscal years 2013, 2012, and 2011, respectively. amortization of capitalized software was $210 million, $117 million, and $114 million for fiscal years 2013, 2012, and 2011, respectively.  the following table outlines the estimated future amortization expense related to intangible assets held at june\u00a030, 2013:  \u00a0 note 12 - debt  as of june\u00a030, 2013, the total carrying value and estimated fair value of our long-term debt, including the current portion, were $15.6 billion and $15.8 billion, respectively. this is compared to a carrying value and estimated fair value of $11.9 billion and $13.2 billion, respectively, as of june\u00a030, 2012. these estimated fair values are based on level 2 inputs.  \u00a0 71  table of contents  \u00a0 part ii  item 8  \u00a0 the components of our long-term debt, including the current portion, and the associated interest rates were as follows as of june\u00a030, 2013 and 2012:  \u00a0 \u00a0 as of june\u00a030, 2013 and 2012, the aggregate unamortized discount for our long-term debt, including the current portion, was $65 million and $56 million, respectively.  notes  the notes are senior unsecured obligations and rank equally with our other unsecured and unsubordinated debt outstanding.  convertible debt  in june 2013, we paid cash of $1.25 billion for the principal amount of our zero coupon convertible unsecured debt and elected to deliver cash for the $96 million excess obligation resulting from the conversion of the notes. each $1,000 principal amount of notes was convertible into 30.68 shares of microsoft common stock at a conversion price of $32.59 per share. as of june\u00a030, 2012, the net carrying amount of the convertible debt and the unamortized discount were $1.2 billion and $19 million, respectively.  in connection with the issuance of the notes in 2010, we entered into capped call transactions with certain option counterparties with a strike price equal to the conversion price of the notes. upon conversion of the notes in june  \u00a0 72  table of contents  \u00a0 part ii  item 8  \u00a0  2013, we exercised the capped calls. the bulk of the capped calls were physically settled by acquiring 29\u00a0million shares of our own common stock for $938 million. the remaining capped calls were net cash settled for $24 million.  debt service  maturities of our long-term debt for each of the next five years and thereafter are as follows:  \u00a0 interest on the notes is paid semi-annually, except for the euro-denominated debt securities on which interest is paid annually. cash paid for interest on our debt for fiscal years 2013, 2012, and 2011 was $371 million, $344 million, and $197 million, respectively.  credit facility  in june 2013, we established a commercial paper program for the issuance and sale of up to $1.3 billion in commercial paper. as of june\u00a030, 2013, we have not issued any commercial paper under this program.  in june 2013, we entered into a $1.3 billion credit facility, which will serve as a back-up for our commercial paper program. as of june\u00a030, 2013, we were in compliance with the only financial covenant in the credit agreement, which requires us to maintain a coverage ratio of at least three times earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization to interest expense, as defined in the credit agreement. the credit facility expires on june\u00a024, 2018. no amounts were drawn against the credit facility since its inception.  note 13 - income taxes  the components of the provision for income taxes were as follows:  \u00a0 \u00a0 73  table of contents  \u00a0 part ii  item 8  \u00a0 u.s. and international components of income before income taxes were as follows:  \u00a0 the items accounting for the difference between income taxes computed at the u.s. federal statutory rate and our effective rate were as follows:  \u00a0 the reduction from the federal statutory rate from foreign earnings taxed at lower rates results from producing and distributing our products and services through our foreign regional operations centers in ireland, singapore, and puerto rico. our foreign earnings, which are taxed at rates lower than the u.s. rate and are generated from our regional operating centers, were 79%, 79%, and 78% of our international income before tax in fiscal years 2013, 2012, and 2011, respectively. in general, other reconciling items consist of interest, u.s. state income taxes, domestic production deductions, and credits. in fiscal years 2013, 2012, and 2011, there were no individually significant other reconciling items. the i.r.s. settlement is discussed below.  \u00a0 74  table of contents  \u00a0 part ii  item 8  \u00a0 the components of the deferred income tax assets and liabilities were as follows:  \u00a0 as of june\u00a030, 2013, we had net operating loss carryforwards of $2.7 billion, including $2.2 billion of foreign net operating loss carryforwards acquired through our acquisition of skype. the valuation allowance disclosed in the table above relates to the foreign net operating loss carryforwards that may not be realized.  deferred income tax balances reflect the effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases and are stated at enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when the taxes are actually paid or recovered.  as of june\u00a030, 2013, we have not provided deferred u.s. income taxes or foreign withholding taxes on temporary differences of approximately $76.4 billion resulting from earnings for certain non-u.s. subsidiaries which are permanently reinvested outside the u.s. the unrecognized deferred tax liability associated with these temporary differences was approximately $24.4 billion at june\u00a030, 2013.  income taxes paid were $3.9 billion, $3.5 billion, and $5.3 billion in fiscal years 2013, 2012, and 2011, respectively.  uncertain tax positions  as of june\u00a030, 2013, we had $8.6 billion of unrecognized tax benefits of which $6.5 billion, if recognized, would affect our effective tax rate. as of june\u00a030, 2012, we had $7.2 billion of unrecognized tax benefits of which $6.2 billion, if recognized, would have affected our effective tax rate.  interest on unrecognized tax benefits was $400 million, $154 million, and $38 million in fiscal years 2013, 2012, and 2011, respectively. as of june\u00a030, 2013, 2012, and 2011, we had accrued interest related to uncertain tax positions of $1.3 billion, $939 million, and $785 million, respectively, net of federal income tax benefits.  \u00a0 75  table of contents  \u00a0 part ii  item 8  \u00a0 the aggregate changes in the balance of unrecognized tax benefits were as follows:  \u00a0 during the third quarter of fiscal year 2011, we reached a settlement of a portion of an i.r.s. audit of tax years 2004 to 2006, which reduced our income tax expense by $461 million. while we settled a portion of the i.r.s. audit, we remain under audit for these years. in february 2012, the i.r.s. withdrew its 2011 revenue agents report and reopened the audit phase of the examination. as of june\u00a030, 2013, the primary unresolved issue relates to transfer pricing, which could have a significant impact on our financial statements if not resolved favorably. we believe our allowances for tax contingencies are appropriate. we do not believe it is reasonably possible that the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits will significantly increase or decrease within the next 12 months, because we do not believe the remaining open issues will be resolved within the next 12 months. we also continue to be subject to examination by the i.r.s. for tax years 2007 to 2012.  we are subject to income tax in many jurisdictions outside the u.s. our operations in certain jurisdictions remain subject to examination for tax years 1996 to 2012, some of which are currently under audit by local tax authorities. the resolutions of these audits are not expected to be material to our financial statements.  note 14 - unearned revenue  unearned revenue comprises mainly unearned revenue from volume licensing programs, and payments for offerings for which we have been paid in advance and we earn the revenue when we provide the service or software or otherwise meet the revenue recognition criteria.  volume licensing programs  unearned revenue from volume licensing programs represents customer billings for multi-year licensing arrangements paid either at inception of the agreement or annually at the beginning of each coverage period and accounted for as subscriptions with revenue recognized ratably over the coverage period.  other  also included in unearned revenue are payments for post-delivery support and consulting services to be performed in the future; xbox live subscriptions and prepaid points; oem minimum commitments; microsoft dynamics business solutions products; skype prepaid credits and subscriptions; and other offerings for which we have been paid in advance and earn the revenue when we provide the service or software, or otherwise meet the revenue recognition criteria.  \u00a0 76  table of contents  \u00a0 part ii  item 8  \u00a0 the components of unearned revenue were as follows:  \u00a0 \u00a0 unearned revenue by segment was as follows:  \u00a0 note 15 - other long-term liabilities  \u00a0 note 16 - commitments and guarantees  construction and operating leases  we have committed $694 million for constructing new buildings, building improvements, and leasehold improvements as of june\u00a030, 2013.  we have operating leases for most u.s. and international sales and support offices and certain equipment. rental expense for facilities operating leases was $711 million, $639 million, and $525 million, in fiscal years 2013, 2012, and 2011, respectively. future minimum rental commitments under non-cancellable facilities operating leases in place as of june\u00a030, 2013 are as follows:  \u00a0 \u00a0 77  table of contents  \u00a0 part ii  item 8  \u00a0 indemnifications  we provide indemnifications of varying scope and size to certain customers against claims of intellectual property infringement made by third parties arising from the use of our products and certain other matters. we evaluate estimated losses for these indemnifications, and we consider such factors as the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss. to date, we have not encountered significant costs as a result of these obligations and have not accrued any liabilities related to these indemnifications in our financial statements.  note 17 - contingencies  antitrust, unfair competition, and overcharge class actions  a large number of antitrust and unfair competition class action lawsuits were filed against us in various state, federal, and canadian courts on behalf of various classes of direct and indirect purchasers of our pc operating system and certain other software products between 1999 and 2005. we obtained dismissals or reached settlements of all claims made in the united states.  all settlements in the united states have received final court approval. under the settlements, generally class members can obtain vouchers that entitle them to be reimbursed for purchases of a wide variety of platform-neutral computer hardware and software. the total value of vouchers we may issue varies by state. we will make available to certain schools a percentage of those vouchers that are not issued or claimed (one-half to two-thirds depending on the state). the total value of vouchers we ultimately issue will depend on the number of class members who make claims and are issued vouchers. the maximum value of vouchers to be issued is approximately $2.7 billion. the actual costs of these settlements will be less than that maximum amount, depending on the number of class members and schools that are issued and redeem vouchers. we estimate the total cost to resolve all of the state overcharge class action cases will range between $1.9 billion and $2.0 billion. at june\u00a030, 2013, we have recorded a liability related to these claims of approximately $500 million, which reflects our estimated exposure of $1.9 billion less payments made to date of approximately $1.4 billion mostly for vouchers, legal fees, and administrative expenses.  the three cases pending in british columbia, ontario, and quebec, canada have not been settled. in march 2010, the court in the british columbia case certified it as a class action. in april\u00a02011, the british columbia court of appeal reversed the class certification ruling and dismissed the case, holding that indirect purchasers do not have a claim. the plaintiffs have filed an appeal to the canadian supreme court, which was heard in the fall of 2012. the other two actions have been stayed.  other antitrust litigation and claims  in november 2004, novell, inc. (\u0093novell\u0094) filed a complaint in u.s. district court for the district of utah (later transferred to federal court in maryland), asserting antitrust and unfair competition claims against us related to novell\u0092s ownership of wordperfect and other productivity applications during the period between june 1994 and march 1996. in june 2005, the trial court granted our motion to dismiss four of novell\u0092s six claims. in march\u00a02010, the trial court granted summary judgment in favor of microsoft as to all remaining claims. the court of appeals reversed that ruling as to one claim. trial of that claim took place from october to december 2011 and resulted in a mistrial because the jury was unable to reach a verdict. in july 2012, the trial court granted microsoft\u0092s motion for judgment as a matter of law. novell has appealed this decision to the u.s. court of appeals for the tenth circuit, which heard oral arguments in may 2013.  patent and intellectual property claims  motorola litigation  in october 2010, microsoft filed patent infringement complaints against motorola mobility (\u0093motorola\u0094) with the international trade commission (\u0093itc\u0094) and in u.s. district court in seattle for infringement of nine microsoft patents  \u00a0 78  table of contents  \u00a0 part ii  item 8  \u00a0  by motorola\u0092s android devices. since then, microsoft and motorola have filed additional claims against each other in the itc, in federal district courts in seattle, wisconsin, florida, and california, and in courts in germany and the united kingdom. in april 2012, following complaints by microsoft and apple, the european union\u0092s competition office opened two antitrust investigations against motorola to determine whether it has abused certain of its standard essential patents to distort competition in breach of european union antitrust rules. in june 2012, we received a request for information from the u.s. federal trade commission (\u0093ftc\u0094) apparently related to an ftc investigation into whether motorola\u0092s conduct violates u.s. law. the nature of the claims asserted and status of individual matters are summarized below.  international trade commission  the hearing in microsoft\u0092s itc case against motorola took place in august 2011 on seven of the nine patents originally asserted in the complaint. in december 2011, the administrative law judge (\u0093alj\u0094) issued an initial determination that motorola infringed one microsoft patent, and recommended that the itc issue a limited exclusion order against motorola prohibiting importation of infringing motorola android devices. in may 2012, the itc issued the limited exclusion order recommended by the alj, which became effective on july\u00a018, 2012. microsoft has appealed certain aspects of the itc ruling adverse to microsoft and motorola has appealed the itc exclusion order to the court of appeals for the federal circuit. in addition, in july 2013, microsoft filed an action in u.s. district court in washington, d.c. seeking an order to compel enforcement of the itc\u0092s may 2012 import ban against infringing motorola products by the bureau of customs and border protection (\u0093cbp\u0094), after learning that cbp had failed to fully enforce the order.  in november 2010, motorola filed an action against microsoft in the itc alleging infringement of five motorola patents by xbox consoles and accessories and seeking an exclusion order to prohibit importation of the allegedly infringing xbox products into the u.s. in april 2012, the alj found that xbox products infringe four of the five patents asserted by motorola. the alj recommended that the itc issue a limited exclusion order and a cease and desist order. both microsoft and motorola sought itc review of the alj\u0092s findings. in june 2012, microsoft filed a motion to terminate the investigation as to certain patents based on facts arising as the result of google\u0092s acquisition of motorola. the itc determined that it would review the alj\u0092s initial determination in its entirety and remanded the matter to the alj (1)\u00a0to apply certain itc case precedent, (2)\u00a0to rule on microsoft\u0092s june 2012 motion to terminate, and (3)\u00a0set a new target date for completion of the investigation. the alj held a hearing in december\u00a02012 and set a target date for a final itc ruling in july 2013. at motorola\u0092s request, the itc terminated its investigation as to four motorola patents, leaving only one motorola patent at issue before the itc. in march 2013, the alj ruled that there has been no violation as to the remaining motorola patent. motorola sought itc review of the alj\u0092s determination, which the itc denied in may 2013.  u.s. district court  the seattle district court case filed in october 2010 by microsoft as a companion to microsoft\u0092s itc case against motorola has been stayed pending the outcome of microsoft\u0092s itc case.  in november 2010, microsoft sued motorola for breach of contract in u.s. district court in seattle, alleging that motorola breached its commitments to standards-setting organizations to license to microsoft certain patents on reasonable and non-discriminatory (\u0093rand\u0094) terms and conditions. motorola has declared these patents essential to the implementation of the h.264 video standard and the 802.11 wi-fi standard. in suits described below, motorola or a motorola affiliate subsequently sued microsoft on those patents in u.s. district courts, in the itc, and in germany. in february 2012, the seattle district court granted a partial summary judgment in favor of microsoft ruling that (1)\u00a0motorola entered into binding contractual commitments with standards organizations committing to license its declared-essential patents on rand terms and conditions; and (2)\u00a0microsoft is a third-party beneficiary of those commitments. the court rejected motorola\u0092s argument that microsoft had repudiated its right to a rand license, and ruled a trial is needed to determine whether motorola is in breach of its obligation to enter into a patent license with microsoft and, if so, the amount of the rand royalty. in april 2012, the court issued a temporary restraining order preventing motorola from taking steps to enforce an injunction in germany relating to the h.264 video patents. in may 2012, the court converted that order into a preliminary injunction.\u00a0motorola appealed the court\u0092s injunction  \u00a0 79  table of contents  \u00a0 part ii  item 8  \u00a0  orders to the court of appeals for the ninth circuit, which affirmed the orders in september 2012.\u00a0the seattle district court held a trial in november 2012 to determine the rand royalty for motorola\u0092s h.264 and 802.11 patents. in december 2012, the seattle district court ruled that motorola could not obtain injunctive relief in connection with any of its claims for infringement of its h.264 and 802.11 patents. in april 2013, the court set per unit royalties for motorola\u0092s h.264 and 802.11 patents, which resulted in an immaterial microsoft liability. trial of microsoft\u0092s breach of contract claim is set for august\u00a026, 2013.  cases filed by motorola in wisconsin, california, and florida, with the exception of one currently stayed case in wisconsin (a companion case to motorola\u0092s itc action), have been transferred to the u.s district court in seattle. motorola and microsoft both seek damages as well as injunctive relief. no trial dates have been set in any of the transferred cases, and the court has stayed these cases on agreement of the parties.  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 germany  in july 2011, motorola filed patent infringement actions in germany against microsoft and several microsoft subsidiaries.  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 in lawsuits microsoft filed in germany in september, october, and december 2011 and in april 2012, microsoft asserts motorola android devices infringe microsoft patents. microsoft seeks damages and an injunction. in may, july, and september 2012, courts in germany issued injunctions on three patents against motorola android devices and in may and july ruled against microsoft on two patents. microsoft is taking steps to enforce the injunctions. damages will be determined in later proceedings. each party has appealed or is expected to appeal the rulings against it. motorola is also seeking to invalidate microsoft\u0092s patents in parallel court proceedings.  united kingdom  in december 2011, microsoft filed an action against motorola in the high court of justice, chancery division, patents court, in london, england, seeking to revoke the uk part of the european patent asserted by motorola in germany against the activesync protocol. in february 2012, motorola counterclaimed alleging infringement of the  \u00a0 80  table of contents  \u00a0 part ii  item 8  \u00a0  patent and seeking damages and an injunction. a trial took place in december 2012, and the court ruled that motorola\u0092s patent is invalid and revoked. the court also ruled that the patent, even if valid, would be licensed under the grant-back clause in google\u0092s activesync license. motorola has appealed.  other patent and intellectual property claims  in addition to these cases, there are approximately 65 other patent infringement cases pending against microsoft.  other  we also are subject to a variety of other claims and suits that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of our business. although management currently believes that resolving claims against us, individually or in aggregate, will not have a material adverse impact on our financial statements, these matters are subject to inherent uncertainties and management\u0092s view of these matters may change in the future.  as of june\u00a030, 2013, we had accrued aggregate liabilities of $412 million in other current liabilities and $162 million in other long-term liabilities for all of our legal matters that were contingencies as of that date. while we intend to defend these matters vigorously, adverse outcomes that we estimate could reach approximately $400 million in aggregate beyond recorded amounts are reasonably possible. were unfavorable final outcomes to occur, there exists the possibility of a material adverse impact on our financial statements for the period in which the effects become reasonably estimable.  note 18 - stockholders\u0092 equity  shares outstanding  shares of common stock outstanding were as follows:  \u00a0 share repurchases  on september\u00a022, 2008, we announced that our board of directors approved a share repurchase program authorizing up to $40.0 billion in share repurchases with an expiration date of september\u00a030, 2013. as of june\u00a030, 2013, approximately $3.6 billion of the approved repurchase amount remained. the repurchase program may be suspended or discontinued at any time without prior notice.  we repurchased the following shares of common stock under the above-described repurchase plan using cash resources:  \u00a0 \u00a0 81  table of contents  \u00a0 part ii  item 8  \u00a0 dividends  in fiscal year 2013, our board of directors declared the following dividends:  \u00a0  the dividend declared on june\u00a012, 2013 will be paid after the filing date of this report on form 10-k and was included in other current liabilities as of june\u00a030, 2013.  in fiscal year 2012, our board of directors declared the following dividends:  \u00a0  the dividend declared on june\u00a013, 2012 was included in other current liabilities as of june\u00a030, 2012.  note 19 - other comprehensive income (loss)  the activity in other comprehensive income (loss) and related income tax effects were as follows:  \u00a0 \u00a0 82  table of contents  \u00a0 part ii  item 8  \u00a0 the components of accumulated other comprehensive income were as follows:  \u00a0 note 20 - employee stock and savings plans  we grant stock-based compensation to directors and employees. at june\u00a030, 2013, an aggregate of 425\u00a0million shares were authorized for future grant under our stock plans, covering stock options, stock awards, and leadership stock awards. awards that expire or are canceled without delivery of shares generally become available for issuance under the plans. we issue new shares of microsoft common stock to satisfy exercises and vesting of awards granted under all of our stock plans.  stock-based compensation expense and related income tax benefits were as follows:  \u00a0  stock plans (excluding stock options)  stock awards  stock awards (\u0093sas\u0094) are grants that entitle the holder to shares of microsoft common stock as the award vests. sas generally vest over a five-year period.  leadership stock awards  leadership stock awards (\u0093lsas\u0094) are a form of sas in which the number of shares ultimately received depends on our business performance against specified performance metrics. lsas replaced shared performance stock awards (\u0093spsa\u0094) in fiscal year 2013. shares previously issued under the spsa program will continue to vest ratably under their original term, generally with a three-year remaining service period.  a base number of lsas are granted in each fiscal year, which represents the performance period for the awards. following the end of the performance period, the number of shares can be increased by 25% if certain performance metrics are met. one quarter of the awarded shares will vest one year after the grant date. the remaining shares will vest semi-annually during the following three years.  executive incentive plan  under the executive incentive plan (\u0093eip\u0094), the compensation committee awards performance-based compensation comprising both cash and sas to executive officers and certain senior executives. for executive officers, their awards are based on an aggregate incentive pool equal to a percentage of consolidated operating income. for fiscal years 2013, 2012, and 2011, the pool was 0.35%, 0.3%, and 0.25% of operating income, respectively. the sas vest ratably in august of each of the four years following the grant date. the final cash awards will be determined after each performance period based on individual and business performance.  \u00a0 83  table of contents  \u00a0 part ii  item 8  \u00a0 activity for all stock plans  the fair value of each award was estimated on the date of grant using the following assumptions:  \u00a0  during fiscal year 2013, the following activity occurred under our stock plans:  \u00a0 as of june\u00a030, 2013, there was approximately $5.0 billion of total unrecognized compensation costs related to stock awards. these costs are expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 3 years.  during fiscal year 2012 and 2011, the following activity occurred under our stock plans:  \u00a0  total vest-date fair value of stock awards vested was $2.8 billion, $2.4 billion, and $1.8 billion, for fiscal years 2013, 2012, and 2011, respectively.  stock options  currently, we grant stock options primarily in conjunction with business acquisitions. we granted two million, six million, and zero stock options in conjunction with business acquisitions during fiscal years 2013, 2012, and 2011, respectively.  employee stock options activity during 2013 was as follows:  \u00a0 \u00a0 84  table of contents  \u00a0 part ii  item 8  \u00a0 as of june\u00a030, 2013, approximately four\u00a0million options that were granted in conjunction with business acquisitions were outstanding. these options have an exercise price range of $0.01 to $29.24 and a weighted average exercise price of $7.33.  during the periods reported, the following stock option exercise activity occurred:  \u00a0 employee stock purchase plan  we have an employee stock purchase plan (the \u0093plan\u0094) for all eligible employees. shares of our common stock may be purchased by employees at three-month intervals at 90% of the fair market value on the last trading day of each three-month period. employees may purchase shares having a value not exceeding 15% of their gross compensation during an offering period. employees purchased the following shares during the periods presented:  \u00a0 at june\u00a030, 2013, 191\u00a0million shares of our common stock were reserved for future issuance through the plan.  savings plan  we have a savings plan in the u.s. that qualifies under section\u00a0401(k) of the internal revenue code, and a number of savings plans in international locations. participating u.s. employees may contribute up to 75% of their salary, but not more than statutory limits. we contribute fifty cents for each dollar a participant contributes in this plan, with a maximum contribution of 3% of a participant\u0092s earnings. matching contributions for all plans were $393 million, $373 million, and $282 million in fiscal years 2013, 2012, and 2011, respectively, and were expensed as contributed. matching contributions are invested proportionate to each participant\u0092s voluntary contributions in the investment options provided under the plan. investment options in the u.s. plan include microsoft common stock, but neither participant nor our matching contributions are required to be invested in microsoft common stock.  note 21 - segment information and geographic data  in its operation of the business, management, including our chief operating decision maker, the company\u0092s chief executive officer, reviews certain financial information, including segmented internal profit and loss statements prepared on a basis not consistent with u.s. gaap. the segment information within this note is reported on that basis. during the periods presented, our five segments were windows division, server and tools, online services division, microsoft business division, and entertainment and devices division. during the three months ended december\u00a031, 2012, we changed the name of our windows\u00a0& windows live division to windows division.  due to the integrated structure of our business, certain revenue earned and costs incurred by one segment may benefit other segments. revenue on certain contracts may be allocated among the segments based on the relative value of the underlying products and services. costs that are identifiable are allocated to the segments that benefit to incent cross-collaboration among our segments so that one segment is not solely burdened by the cost of a mutually beneficial activity. allocated costs may include those relating to development and marketing of products and services from which multiple segments benefit, or those costs relating to services performed by one segment on behalf of other segments. each allocation is measured differently based on the specific facts and circumstances of the costs being allocated.  \u00a0 85  table of contents  \u00a0 part ii  item 8  \u00a0 in addition, certain costs incurred at a corporate level that are identifiable and that benefit our segments are allocated to them. these allocated costs include costs of: field selling; employee benefits; shared facilities services; and customer service and support. each allocation is measured differently based on the specific facts and circumstances of the costs being allocated. certain other corporate-level activity is not allocated to our segments, including costs of: broad-based sales and marketing; product support services; human resources; legal; finance; information technology; corporate development and procurement activities; research and development; legal settlements and contingencies; and employee severance.  we have recast certain prior period amounts within this note to conform to the way we internally managed and monitored segment performance during the current fiscal year, reflecting immaterial movements of business activities between segments and changes in cost allocations. in july 2013, we announced a change in organizational structure as part of our transformation to a devices and services company. as we evolve how we allocate resources and analyze performance in the new structure, it is possible that our segments may change.  the principal products and services provided by each segment are summarized below:  windows division \u0096 windows division offerings consist of the windows operating system, surface, and pc accessories.  server and tools \u0096 server and tools product and service offerings include windows server, windows azure, microsoft sql server, windows intune, windows embedded, visual studio, system center products, and enterprise services. enterprise services comprise premier product support services and microsoft consulting services.  online services division \u0096 online services division offerings include bing, bing ads, and msn.  microsoft business division \u0096 microsoft business division offerings include microsoft office, exchange, sharepoint, lync, yammer, microsoft dynamics business solutions, and office 365.  entertainment and devices division \u0096 entertainment and devices division offerings include the xbox 360

during the periods presented:  \u00a0 \u00a0 86  table of contents  \u00a0 part ii  item 8  \u00a0 reconciling amounts in the tables above and below include adjustments to conform our internal accounting policies to u.s. gaap and corporate-level activity not specifically attributed to a segment. significant internal accounting policies that differ from u.s. gaap relate to revenue recognition, income statement classification, and depreciation.  significant reconciling items were as follows:  \u00a0 \u00a0 no sales to an individual customer or country other than the united states accounted for more than 10% of fiscal year 2013, 2012, or 2011 revenue. revenue, classified by the major geographic areas in which our customers are located, was as follows:  \u00a0 \u00a0 revenue from external customers, classified by significant product and service offerings were as follows:  \u00a0 \u00a0 87  table of contents  \u00a0 part ii  item 8  \u00a0 assets are not allocated to segments for internal reporting presentations. a portion of amortization and depreciation is included with various other costs in an overhead allocation to each segment, and it is impracticable for us to separately identify the amount of amortization and depreciation by segment that is included in the measure of segment profit or loss.  long-lived assets, excluding financial instruments and tax assets, classified by the location of the controlling statutory company and with countries over 10% of the total shown separately, were as follows:  \u00a0 note 22 - quarterly information (unaudited)  \u00a0  \u00a0 \u00a0 88  table of contents  \u00a0 part ii  item 8  \u00a0 report of independent registered public accounting firm  to the board of directors and stockholders of microsoft corporation  redmond, washington  we have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of microsoft corporation and subsidiaries (the \u0093company\u0094) as of june\u00a030, 2013 and 2012, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, cash flows, and stockholders\u0092 equity for each of the three years in the period ended june\u00a030, 2013.\u00a0these financial statements are the responsibility of the company\u0092s management. our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.  we conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board (united states).\u00a0those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.\u00a0an audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.\u00a0an audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. we believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.  in our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of microsoft corporation and subsidiaries as of june\u00a030, 2013 and 2012, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended june\u00a030, 2013, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america.  we have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board (united states), the company\u0092s internal control over financial reporting as of june\u00a030, 2013, based on the criteria established in internal control \u0096 integrated framework

services, games and internet service offerings. we expect that general macroeconomic trends will remain stable or experience slight improvement in fiscal year 2006 as compared to fiscal year 2005. our optimism is balanced by recent data which revealed slight downward revisions when compared to previous forecasts for gross domestic product growth in the u.s., united kingdom, france, germany, japan and latin america. the leading indicators were also revised slightly lower for the major markets. additionally, recent surveys of chief information officers also reflect slight downward revisions in expected corporate it spend budgets and short-term purchase intent.  as open source software development and distribution evolves, we continue to seek to differentiate our products from competitive products based on open source software. we believe that microsoft\u0092s share of server unit operating systems held steady in fiscal year 2005, while linux distributions rose slightly faster on an absolute basis.  \u00a0 summary  \u00a0 \u00a0 our revenue growth for fiscal year 2005 was driven by growth in licensing of windows server\u0099 operating systems and other server applications, licensing of windows\u00ae client operating systems through oems, and increased licensing of office and other information worker products. the license revenue growth resulted from growth in server hardware and pc shipments, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, and overall improvements in it spending. the november 2004 launch of the \u0093halo 2\u00ae\u0094 xbox game also contributed to the overall revenue growth for the company. based on our preliminary estimates, worldwide pc shipments from all sources grew about 11% to 13% and total server hardware shipments grew approximately 13% to 14% during fiscal year 2005 as compared to fiscal year 2004. the net impact of foreign exchange rates on revenue was positive in 2005, primarily due to relative strengthening of most foreign currencies, particularly the euro and japanese yen, against the u.s. dollar. had the exchange rates from the previous year been in effect in fiscal year 2005, translated international revenue growth earned in local currencies would have been approximately $873 million or two percentage points lower for fiscal year 2005. we hedge a portion of our international currency exposures, thereby reducing our overall exposure. fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates have a greater impact on non-oem commercial and retail license business as a significant portion of those product revenues are denominated in foreign currencies. the vast majority of oem license revenue is denominated in u.s. dollars. partially offsetting revenue growth rates was a $1.1 billion decline in earned revenue from upgrade advantage in fiscal year 2005. the upgrade advantage contract value reached its expiration dates in the first quarter of fiscal year 2005. this revenue was recognized over fiscal year 2003 and fiscal year 2004 and in the first quarter of fiscal year 2005 when the contract period expired.  revenue growth in fiscal year 2004 was primarily driven by the growth in licensing of windows client operating systems through oems, windows server operating systems, office and other server applications as a result of growth in pc and server hardware shipments. the worldwide pc shipment growth rate from all sources was estimated at 13% and the windows server shipment was estimated at 18% in fiscal year 2004 as compared to fiscal year 2003. the net impact of foreign exchange rates on revenue was positive in fiscal year 2004 due to a relative strengthening of most foreign currencies versus the u.s. dollar. this resulted in approximately $1.10 billion growth in total revenue. revenue growth in fiscal year 2003 was driven primarily by multi-year licensing that occurred before the licensing 6.0 transition date in the first quarter of fiscal year 2003. the fiscal year 2003 revenue growth also reflected a $933 million or 13% increase associated with oem licensing of windows operating systems and a $309 million or 23% increase in revenue from xbox video game consoles.  for fiscal year 2005, the operating income increase was driven by a decline in stock-based compensation expense; increased revenue in server and tools, client and information worker, which have higher gross margins as compared to other segments; and a reduction in legal costs associated with major litigation. in addition, strong sales of halo 2 reduced the overall operating loss for the home and entertainment segment for fiscal year 2005. the $3.29 billion decrease in stock-based compensation expense was partially offset by increased operating expenses of $562 million related to increased salary and benefits for new and existing headcount. general and administrative expenses related to major litigation declined in fiscal year 2005 due to the $2.53 billion of charges related to the   \u00a0  table of contents \u00a0part ii\u00a0  item 7  \u00a0 \u00a0  settlement of sun microsystems litigation and the fine imposed by the european commission in fiscal year 2004. this effect was partially offset by legal expenses of $2.08 billion related to settlements with ibm, novell, gateway, and end-user class action plaintiffs to resolve antitrust issues and other matters. in fiscal year 2004, the operating income decline was caused primarily by $2.53 billion of legal charges and $2.21 billion of stock-based compensation expense related to our employee stock option transfer program, mainly offset by an increase in revenue. in fiscal year 2003, the growth in operating income reflected an increase in revenue, partially offset by an increase in operating expenses related to employee and related costs associated with headcount and increased legal settlement expenses, primarily the time warner settlement charge of $750 million.  in fiscal year 2004, we implemented changes in employee compensation whereby employees are granted stock awards rather than stock options. we also completed an employee stock option transfer program in the second quarter of fiscal year 2004 in which employees could elect to transfer all of their vested and unvested stock options with a strike price of $33 or higher to jpmorgan. the unvested options that were transferred to jpmorgan became vested upon the transfer. a total of 345 million of the 621 million eligible options were transferred, which resulted in additional stock-based compensation expense of $2.21 billion in the second quarter of fiscal year 2004. as a result of these changes, we expect stock-based compensation expense to continue to decrease for at least the next three fiscal years.  the following table shows total stock-based compensation expense by segment and by income statement classification for fiscal years 2003, 2004 and 2005.  \u00a0 \u00a0 in fiscal year 2006, we expect revenue to grow at a higher rate than fiscal year 2005, mainly due to the launches of new products. we expect higher revenue growth in fiscal year 2006 as compared to fiscal year 2005 in home and entertainment primarily driven by the launch of xbox 360. we estimate worldwide pc shipments will grow between 7% to 9% and worldwide server unit shipments will grow between 11% to 13% in fiscal year 2006 as compared to fiscal year 2005. we do not expect a benefit from year-over-year foreign currency exchange rates in fiscal year 2006.  we expect our operating income growth rate in fiscal year 2006 to exceed our revenue growth rate. operating income is expected to reflect lower operating expenses due to lower costs for legal settlements than incurred in fiscal year 2005 and a reduction in stock-based compensation expense. the operating loss for home and entertainment is expected to increase in fiscal year 2006 driven by the launch of and investments in xbox 360.  \u00a0 segment product revenue/operating income (loss)  \u00a0 our seven segments are client; server and tools; information worker; microsoft business solutions; msn; mobile and embedded devices; and home and entertainment.  the revenue and operating income/(loss) amounts in this section are presented on a basis consistent with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles (gaap) and include certain reconciling items attributable to each of the   \u00a0  table of contents \u00a0part ii\u00a0  item 7  \u00a0  segments. the segment information appearing in note 18 \u0096 segment information of the notes to financial statements is presented on a basis consistent with the company\u0092s internal management reporting, in accordance with sfas no. 131, disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information. certain corporate level expenses have been excluded from our segment operating results and are analyzed separately. fiscal years 2003 and 2004 amounts have been restated for certain internal reorganizations and to conform to the current period presentation including reclassifying certain legal settlements from business segments to corporate-level expense.  \u00a0 client  \u00a0 \u00a0 client includes revenue from windows xp professional and home, media center edition, tablet pc edition, and other standard windows operating systems. client revenue growth is correlated with the growth of corporate and consumer purchases of pcs from oems that pre-install versions of windows operating systems because the oem channel accounts for over 80% of total client revenue. the operating results for all periods presented have been restated to reflect the reorganization of the windows security group from server and tools to client.  client revenue increased in fiscal year 2005 driven by 12% growth in oem license units and $886 million or 10% growth in oem revenue from increased pc unit shipments, partially offset by a $198 million or 9% decrease in revenue from commercial and retail licensing of windows operating systems. this channel-mix shift reflects our customers\u0092 continued preference for upgrading their pc operating systems through the oem channel when they replace their pcs versus the purchase of a multi-year licensing agreement. the mix of oem windows operating systems licensed with premium edition operating systems as a percentage of total oem windows operating systems licensed during the year remained flat at 50% of total oem windows operating systems as compared to the previous year. revenue earned from upgrade advantage declined by $99 million in fiscal year 2005 contributing to the decrease in commercial and retail licensing revenue. the differences between unit growth rates and revenue growth rates from year to year are affected by the mix of premium versions of operating systems licensed during the year, changes in the geographical mix, the channel mix of products sold by large, multi-national oems versus those sold by local and regional system builders, and previous changes to deferral rates and product lives for undelivered elements of unearned revenue. client revenue increase in fiscal year 2004 was driven by 14% growth in oem licenses and 16% growth in oem revenue on increased consumer pc unit shipments in the first half of the fiscal year and growth in business pc unit shipments in the second half of fiscal year 2004.  client operating income increased in fiscal year 2005 primarily due to an increase in oem revenue and a decrease in stock-based compensation expense. these factors were partially offset by an increase in sales and marketing expenses associated with \u0093start something,\u0094 a globally launched advertising campaign, marketing for security initiatives, and an increase in salary and benefits for new and existing headcount. the additional headcount for research and development was primarily devoted to the continued development of the windows client next-generation operating system. the operating income for fiscal year 2004 has been restated for a reclassification of legal settlement charges totaling $700 million from client to corporate expenses to conform to the current year presentation. client operating income increased for fiscal year 2004 compared to fiscal year 2003 mainly due to growth in revenue, partially offset by increased operating expenses primarily related to stock-based compensation expense from the employee stock option transfer program in the second quarter of fiscal year 2004.  we anticipate that worldwide pc shipments will grow at approximately 7% to 9% in fiscal year 2006, continuing to influence our growth in client revenue. in addition, we estimate that increasing shipments of laptops as a percentage of total pc systems will continue to positively influence client revenue growth due to shorter replacement cycles for laptops. the time between operating system releases may affect our ability to close some multi-year licensing agreements. we expect growth rates in emerging markets to continue to outpace mature market growth rates. piracy continues to be a challenge in both emerging and mature markets. we intend to focus on growing oem licenses faster than the overall market by reducing piracy, particularly in the mature markets, through initiatives such as windows genuine advantage. client commercial and retail licensing revenues are expected to continue to lag behind overall client revenue growth, but we expect to see improvements in these channels in fiscal year 2006 compared to fiscal year 2005. we anticipate a modest increase in our premium product mix in fiscal year 2006, although we   \u00a0  table of contents \u00a0part ii\u00a0  item 7  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  anticipate shipments of the premium-priced media center edition will grow as a percentage of the total operating system shipments. major investments in fiscal year 2006 will focus on development of windows vista, the next-generation pc operating system, and will include marketing initiatives such as the global \u0093start something\u0094 campaign.  \u00a0 server and tools  \u00a0 \u00a0 server and tools consists of server software licenses and client access licenses (cals) for windows server, microsoft sql server\u00ae, exchange server, and other server products. it also includes developer tools, training, certification, microsoft press, premier and professional product support services, and microsoft consulting services. server and tools concentrates on licensing products, applications, tools, content, and services that make information technology professionals and developers more productive and efficient. the segment uses multiple channels for licensing including pre-installed oem versions, licenses through partners, and licenses directly to end customers. the licenses are sold both as one-time licenses and as multi-year volume licenses depending upon the needs of different customers. server and tools uses product innovation and partnerships with information technology professionals to drive the adoption and sales growth of its products. server and tools growth is driven by performance of the overall market for information technology \u0096 both hardware and software. the operating results for previous years have been restated for the reorganization of the windows security group from server and tools to client and the reorganization of professional product support services from information worker to server and tools.  server and tools revenue growth in fiscal year 2005 was mainly driven by growth in server and server application revenue, including cal revenue, which grew $1.1 billion or 17% in fiscal year 2005 reflecting broad adoption of windows server system\u0099 products, including windows server, sql server, exchange server, and management servers. we estimate that overall server hardware shipments grew 13% to 14% during fiscal year 2005 and that windows-based server shipments grew at a comparable rate for the same period. consulting and premier and professional product support services revenue increased $241 million or 19% compared to the previous year, primarily due to increased consultant utilization and new premier customers. foreign currency exchange rate changes accounted for approximately $284 million or three percentage points of total server and tools revenue growth, which was offset by a $314 million decline in upgrade advantage revenue earned. in fiscal year 2004, server and server applications revenue, including cal revenue, grew $1.28 billion or 25%. foreign currency exchange rates contributed approximately $350 million or five percentage points of server and tools revenue growth in fiscal year 2004 compared to fiscal year 2003. consulting and premier product support services revenue increased $192 million or 18% compared to fiscal year 2003 due to increased customer penetration from new product offerings.  server and tools operating income growth for fiscal year 2005 was primarily due to an increase in revenue and a decrease in stock-based compensation expense. this was partially offset by an increase in sales and marketing costs and headcount-related costs from increased hiring and increases in salary and benefits. operating income for the previous year has been restated for a reclassification of $1.22 billion of legal settlements from server and tools to corporate expenses to conform to the current year presentation. server and tools operating income for fiscal year 2004 increased slightly due to the revenue increase offset by increased stock-based compensation charges, including $651 million related to the employee stock option transfer program in the second quarter of fiscal year 2004.  we expect worldwide server hardware shipments to grow 11% to 13% in fiscal year 2006. however, we face strong competition from linux-based, unix, and other server operating systems. we anticipate little or no year-over-year foreign currency exchange rate impacts in fiscal year 2006. we also expect server and tools operating expenses to increase during fiscal year 2006 due to expected investment in headcount and new marketing initiatives and upcoming product releases, including sql server 2005 and visual studio 2005.  \u00a0  table of contents \u00a0part ii\u00a0  item 7  \u00a0 information worker  \u00a0 \u00a0 information worker consists of the microsoft office system of programs, servers, services, and solutions designed to increase personal, team, and organization productivity. information worker includes microsoft office, microsoft project, microsoft visio\u00ae, sharepoint\u00ae portal server cals, and other information worker products including microsoft livemeeting\u00ae and onenote\u00ae. most revenue from this segment comes from licensing our office system products. revenue growth depends on the ability to add value to the core office product set and expand our product offerings in other information worker areas such as document lifecycle management, collaboration, and business intelligence. beginning in fiscal year 2005, the small and mid-market solutions & partners (sms&p) organization, which was historically part of information worker, was re-aligned in microsoft business solutions. as a result of this change, information worker results have been restated to reflect the reclassification of the sms&p organization to microsoft business solutions. the results for previous periods have also been restated due to the reclassification of professional product support services from information worker into server and tools.  information worker revenue increased in fiscal year 2005 primarily due to a 3% or $269 million increase in volume licensing, retail packaged product, and pre-installed versions of office in japan, a 6% or $91 million increase in oem revenue, and the impact of foreign currency exchange rates, partially offset by reduced upgrade advantage earned revenue. changes in foreign currency exchange rates accounted for approximately $367 million or three percentage points of the revenue growth for fiscal year 2005 as compared to the previous fiscal year, offset by a $663 million decline in upgrade advantage earned revenue. revenue growth for fiscal year 2004 from volume licensing, retail packaged product and pre-installed versions of office in japan was 15% in aggregate. this increase was driven by recognition of unearned revenue primarily from a large increase in multi-year licenses signed previous to the transition to our licensing 6.0 programs and approximately $110 million related to the launch of office 2003. oem licensing revenue grew 29% or $325 million. foreign currency exchange rates provided approximately $485 million or 5% of total information worker revenue growth.  information worker operating income growth for fiscal year 2005 was primarily due to the revenue growth and a decrease in stock-based compensation expense. operating expenses were also impacted by a reduction in marketing campaign costs from the previous period associated with the launch of office 2003. this decline was offset by an increase in headcount-related costs from increased hiring and increases in salary and benefits. information worker operating income in fiscal year 2004 increased from the previous year primarily due to growth in revenue, partially offset by an increase in operating expenses, primarily related to $351 million of stock-based compensation expense from the employee stock option transfer program in the second quarter of fiscal year 2004 and higher sales and marketing expenses.  the revenue growth rate for information worker is expected to be higher in fiscal year 2006 than fiscal year 2005. we expect sustained momentum in our oem and multi-year licensing offerings and increased purchasing of office system 2003 as enterprises complete their product evaluations. we expect to see slowing revenue from packaged product late in the year as we approach the next version launch. we anticipate little or no year-over-year foreign currency exchange rate benefit in fiscal year 2006.

strong players in the enterprise segment while the mid-market segment is more fragmented. microsoft business solutions now includes the sms&p organization, which previously had been included in information worker. sms&p supports small and mid-market customers for microsoft including microsoft business solutions. results have been restated to reflect the reclassification of sms&p for all periods presented. also as a result of the reorganization, the microsoft partner program became a component of microsoft business solutions.  the increase in microsoft business solutions revenue in fiscal year 2005 was mainly due to a 10% revenue growth in software partially offset by a 25% decline in services revenue, which resulted from encouraging our partners to provide more of these types of services. the software revenue increase was driven by a 9% growth in license revenue and 16% growth in enhancement revenue as compared to the previous year, and is attributed to growth in our line of business solutions and customer relationship management solutions, and increased microsoft partner program subscriptions. the revenue increase in fiscal year 2004 was primarily attributable to continued growth in licensing of navision and axapta line of business solutions, new sales of microsoft crm, and microsoft partner program subscriptions.  microsoft business solutions operating loss declined in fiscal year 2005 primarily due to a decline in stock-based compensation expense, an increase in product revenue, and a decline in acquisition intangibles amortization. the reduction in operating loss was partially offset by a net increase in sales and marketing expense driven by incremental headcount and marketing costs in the sms&p organization. in addition, there has been an increase in marketing and product development investments in our portfolio of business solutions. the operating loss for fiscal year 2004 increased from fiscal year 2003 due to an increase in stock-based compensation expense from the employee stock option transfer program in the second quarter of fiscal year 2004, partially offset by an increase in revenue and lower operating expenses including $42 million of lower intangibles amortization costs.  microsoft business solutions expects continued revenue growth through its portfolio of business solutions and related product releases, including newer applications such as microsoft office small business accounting and microsoft crm. continued investment in the next generation of solutions, broader geographical coverage, and plans for facilitating our partners to provide customized vertical solutions should result in improved business performance for microsoft business solutions in fiscal year 2006.  \u00a0 msn  \u00a0 \u00a0 msn includes personal communications services, such as e-mail and instant messaging, and online information offerings, such as msn search and the msn portals and channels around the world. msn also provides a variety of online paid services in addition to msn internet access and msn premium web services. revenue is derived primarily from advertisers on msn, from consumers and partners through subscriptions and transactions generated from online paid services, and from subscribers to msn narrowband internet access. in fiscal year 2005, we launched a new version of our msn search engine, which is based on our own technology. this change will help provide the ability to innovate more quickly and the opportunity to develop a long-term competitive advantage in search. in addition to the launch of msn search, we introduced many new products and product enhancements in fiscal year 2005, including a new version of the msn home page which provides a richer user experience, quicker load times, higher levels of end user customization, and fewer advertisements and links. msn launched the clarity in advertising program in fiscal year 2005, which removed paid advertising from inclusion in search results and resulted in a reduced number of advertisements that are returned with search results.  in fiscal year 2005, msn advertising revenue increased $193 million or 16% primarily as a result of industry and market growth, and continued growth of msn display advertising revenue, tempered by the search clarity in   \u00a0  table of contents \u00a0part ii\u00a0  item 7  \u00a0  advertising program and the impact of the home page redesign. revenue from subscription and transaction services other than internet access increased $84 million or 88% in fiscal year 2005 as a result of growth in the number of msn premium subscribers through our carrier partnerships. offsetting the overall revenue growth was a decline of $219 million or 24% in internet access revenue, driven by the continued migration of internet access subscribers to broadband or other competitively priced internet service providers. at the end of the current fiscal year, msn had 2.7 million internet access subscribers and 9.1 million total subscribers compared to 4.3 million and 8.8 million at the end of the previous year. in addition, msn has over 420 million unique users monthly, over 205 million active hotmail accounts, and over 175 million active messenger accounts. in fiscal year 2004, msn advertising revenue increased $360 million or 43% as a result of growth in paid search and growth in the overall internet advertising market. this increase was partially offset by a decline of $168 million or 15% in internet access revenue. revenue from subscription and transaction services other than internet access increased $71 million.  in fiscal year 2005, msn operating income increased mainly due to a decrease in stock-based compensation expense, reduced online operations and bandwidth costs associated with the internet access business as the number of subscribers declines, and increased advertising and subscription revenue. the operating income increase was partially offset by an increase in headcount-related costs from increased hiring and increases in salary and benefits, and a $48 million tax benefit recorded in the first quarter of fiscal year 2004. msn reached profitability in the first quarter of fiscal year 2004 and was profitable for fiscal year 2004. the improvement in profitability in fiscal year 2004 was primarily driven by an increase in revenue, a decline in customer acquisition costs and other expenses related to the internet access business, efficiency gains in the operations of the advertising and subscription businesses, and a $48 million refund of previous year taxes, partially offset by an increase in stock-based compensation expense.  msn expects increased growth in advertising revenue as it benefits from improvements to its advertising platform and search engine and continued increases in internet spending. we expect revenue from narrowband internet access to continue to decline in fiscal year 2006. profitability may decline in fiscal year 2006 as investments are made in the development of new applications and services, the search and search monetization platform, and growth in the field sales force. msn may from time to time continue to make investments in improving the user experience and in some cases, the number of advertisements delivered either via our search tools or via our internet portals may be reduced to improve the overall user experience thereby helping to sustain and grow our user base. effective july 1, 2005, functions related to mappoint in mobile and embedded devices have been moved to msn. this reorganization will result in a corresponding change to the mobile and embedded devices and msn reported results.  \u00a0 mobile and embedded devices  \u00a0 \u00a0 mobile and embedded devices includes windows mobile\u0099 software, windows embedded operating systems, mappoint\u00ae, and windows automotive. these products extend the advantages of the windows platform to mobile devices such as pdas, phones, and a wide range of embedded devices. the business is also responsible for managing sales and customer relationships for microsoft overall with device manufacturers and communication sector customers. the communication sector includes network service providers (such as wireless, wireline and cable operators), and media and entertainment companies. the market for products in these segments is intensely competitive. competitive alternatives vary based on product lines and include product offerings from commercial and non-commercial mobile operating system providers, and proprietary software developed by oems and mobile operators. short product lifecycles in product lines such as windows mobile software may impact our continuing revenue streams.  mobile and embedded devices revenue growth for fiscal year 2005 was primarily due to unit volume increases in all major product lines, especially windows mobile software sales and windows embedded operating systems. increased revenue for windows mobile software was primarily driven by increased market demand for connected mobile devices such as phone-enabled pdas and smartphones, and strong growth in volume shipments for   \u00a0  table of contents \u00a0part ii\u00a0  item 7  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  standalone pdas. the increase in windows embedded revenue was due to our operating system being included in new product designs for both new and existing customers. mobile and embedded devices also benefited from the increased demand for on-line mapping and the introduction of new mappoint finished goods products. this new functionality resulted in increased unit sales for mobile, embedded, and mappoint product categories. in fiscal year 2005, revenue for windows mobile software increased $46 million or 45%, revenue for windows embedded operating systems increased $19 million or 21% and revenue for mappoint and windows automotive increased $25 million or 45%. mobile and embedded devices realized positive increases in customer satisfaction ratings from both mobile operator partners and the developer community. in fiscal year 2005, mobile and embedded devices released windows mobile 5.0 which is the latest version of our mobile operating software. unit volume increases drove revenue growth for fiscal year 2004 over fiscal year 2003 in all major product lines. the growth was primarily due to the increased number of oems and mobile operators shipping windows mobile software for smartphones, increases in market share for our pocket pc and embedded products and increased usage by existing customers of our mappoint web service.  mobile and embedded devices operating loss for fiscal year 2005 decreased compared to fiscal year 2004 primarily due to a decrease in stock-based compensation expense. the growth in revenue and a reduction in sales and marketing expense also contributed to improved operating results in this period compared to the previous year. this improvement has been partially offset by increased salary and benefit costs from increased hiring and increased investment in research and development. the mobile and embedded devices operating loss for fiscal year 2004 decreased compared to fiscal year 2003 primarily due to growth in revenue and lower marketing expenses, partially offset by $58 million of stock-based compensation expense from the employee stock option transfer program in the second quarter of fiscal year 2004.  mobile and embedded devices is committed to continuing product innovation to meet the growing needs of our customers and partners. we will continue to invest in research and development and sales and marketing to develop and market evolving software solutions. in fiscal year 2006 we expect to bring added functionality to the windows mobile 5.0 platform through the windows mobile 5.0 messaging and security feature pack and the exchange server 2003 service pack 2. this solution enables business users to easily stay connected to their microsoft office outlook mobile information and helps businesses to better protect device data. we expect sales for mobile and embedded devices to continue to grow in fiscal year 2006. the growth is anticipated to be driven by an overall increase in customer demand for connectivity, and an increase in the number of new devices being offered by oems and mobile operators incorporating windows mobile software and windows embedded operating systems. growth is also anticipated due to a strong focus on increasing segment share in the connected device space by working with our partners to bring to market a strong portfolio of smartphone and mobile computing devices. in addition, we are focused on bringing to market applications and services on the windows mobile platform that fulfill our customers desire for personalized communication devices. effective july 1, 2005, functions related to mappoint in mobile and embedded devices have been moved to msn. this reorganization will result in a corresponding change to the mobile and embedded devices and msn reported results.  \u00a0 home and entertainment  \u00a0 \u00a0 home and entertainment includes the microsoft xbox video game console system, pc games, the home products division (hpd), and tv platform products for the interactive television industry. the success of video game consoles is determined by console functionality, the portfolio of video game content for the console, and the market share of the console. revenue and unit volumes have grown quickly since we entered the market in 2002 and we have established ourselves as one of the market leaders. we believe our competitive position and revenue is bolstered by our increasing software game attach rates, which provides higher margins to offset the declining prices on consoles sold. xbox consoles have negative gross margins.  home and entertainment revenue increased in fiscal year 2005 primarily due to significant new product launches, which resulted in a $416 million or 23% increase in xbox revenue. in the second quarter of fiscal year 2005, we   \u00a0  table of contents \u00a0part ii\u00a0  item 7  \u00a0 \u00a0  introduced halo 2, which generated over $300 million in revenue in the fiscal year. revenue from consumer hardware and software, pc games, and tv platforms declined $50 million or 5% compared to fiscal year 2004 due to lower pc games software sales. in fiscal year 2004, xbox revenue increased $144 million or 9% with $269 million related to higher xbox software volumes and $117 million due to higher xbox console volumes, partially offset by a $242 million decline related to price reductions of xbox consoles and software. overall, xbox console volumes sales increased 11% in fiscal year 2004 compared to fiscal year 2003. revenue from consumer hardware and software, pc games and tv platforms declined $16 million or 1% compared to fiscal year 2003 due to lower pc games software and pc gaming devices sales, partially offset by the new release of mac office.  home and entertainment operating loss in fiscal year 2005 decreased primarily due to an increase in high margin xbox software sales, lower xbox console unit costs, the lower-of-cost-or-market inventory adjustment recorded in fiscal year 2004, and a decrease in stock-based compensation expense. the decrease was partially offset by an increase in costs associated with xbox 360 console development and launch efforts associated with it. the increase in operating loss in fiscal year 2004 was primarily due to $141 million of stock-based compensation expense from the employee stock option transfer program in the second quarter of fiscal year 2004, increased sales of negative margin consoles, and costs associated with xbox 360 console development efforts, partially offset by increased xbox and mac office software sales. the operating loss increase from fiscal year 2003 also included a lower-of-cost-or-market adjustment of approximately $90 million related to xbox console inventory.  we expect operating expenses to continue to increase as we near the launch of xbox 360. as a result of launch-related activities, we expect our operating loss to increase in fiscal year 2006. in fiscal year 2006, we expect xbox console unit volumes and revenue to increase from fiscal year 2005 due to launch of the xbox 360. in fiscal year 2006 we expect pc games revenue to increase from fiscal year 2005 driven by more new game titles.  \u00a0 corporate-level expenses  \u00a0 \u00a0 certain corporate-level expenses are not allocated to our segments. those expenses primarily include corporate operations related to broad-based sales and marketing, product support services, human resources, legal, finance, information technology, corporate development and procurement activities, certain research and development and other costs, and all litigation settlements and accrued legal contingencies.  in fiscal year 2005, corporate-level expenses decreased primarily as a result of a reduction in stock-based compensation expense and decreased corporate legal costs. fiscal year 2005 legal costs were $2.08 billion as compared to $2.53 billion in fiscal year 2004. the legal costs in both years were primarily related to antitrust and competition law claims brought by competitors, class actions on behalf of end users, and by government regulatory bodies outside the united states.  in fiscal year 2004, corporate-level expenses increased primarily due to legal costs including a $1.92 billion charge for a settlement with the sun microsystems, inc., and the fine of \u0080497 million ($605 million) imposed by the european commission. in addition, stock-based compensation increased by $497 million as compared to fiscal year 2003.  \u00a0 cost of revenue  \u00a0 \u00a0 cost of revenue includes manufacturing and distribution costs for products sold and programs licensed, operating costs related to product support service centers and product distribution centers, costs incurred to support and maintain internet-based products and services, and costs associated with the delivery of consulting services. in   \u00a0  table of contents \u00a0part ii\u00a0  item 7  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  addition to a decrease in the cost of revenue in fiscal year 2005 due to lower stock-based compensation expense, the cost of revenue decreased due to a $140 million reduction in costs primarily associated with provisioning the msn internet access business as subscriptions declined and a $169 million reduction in other product costs mainly due to xbox consoles cost efficiency in home and entertainment, partially offset by increased costs in product support and consulting services costs. the increase in fiscal year 2004 was primarily due to increased product support and consulting services costs of $508 million, $214 million of stock-based compensation expense from the employee stock option transfer program, and a lower-of-cost-or-market inventory adjustment in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2004 of approximately $90 million related to the xbox console, partially offset by a $365 million decrease in msn online operations costs.  \u00a0 research and development  \u00a0 \u00a0 research and development expenses include payroll, employee benefits, stock-based compensation, and other headcount-related costs associated with product development. research and development expenses also include third-party development and programming costs, localization costs incurred to translate software for international markets, and the amortization of purchased software code and services content. our research and development expenses decreased in fiscal year 2005 due to lower stock-based compensation expense. this expense decline was partially offset by an increase in headcount-related costs associated with incremental hiring and product development costs associated with upcoming products, primarily the xbox 360 console and related games, sql server 2005, windows vista, and product development in mobile and embedded devices. the increase in fiscal year 2004 was primarily due to $1.31 billion of stock-based compensation expenses related to the option transfer program and other headcount-related payroll and other employee costs associated with a 3% increase in research and development headcount from fiscal year 2003.  \u00a0 sales and marketing  \u00a0 \u00a0 sales and marketing expenses include payroll, employee benefits, stock-based compensation, and other headcount-related costs associated with sales and marketing personnel and advertising, promotions, tradeshows, seminars, and other marketing-related programs. for fiscal year 2005, sales and marketing expense increased slightly due to $470 million higher headcount-related costs from hiring and salary increases; higher sales and marketing costs driven by product planning, reseller marketing, and advertising campaign costs mainly related to launch of the \u0093start something\u0094 campaign; launch of halo 2; and launch arrangements for xbox 360. the increase was offset mainly by reductions in stock-based compensation expense. sales and marketing costs increased in fiscal year 2004 due to $400 million of stock-based compensation expense related to the option transfer program and other headcount-related costs related to a 9% increase in sales and marketing headcount.  \u00a0 general and administrative  \u00a0 \u00a0  table of contents \u00a0part ii\u00a0  item 7  \u00a0 general and administrative costs include payroll, employee benefits, stock-based compensation, and other headcount-related costs associated with finance, legal, facilities, certain human resources, and other administrative headcount; and legal costs and other administrative fees. general and administrative expenses decreased in fiscal year 2005 due to lower legal costs and stock-based compensation expense, partially offset by an increase in other headcount-related costs from new and existing employees of $25 million. in fiscal year 2005, our legal expenses were driven by charges of $2.08 billion, nearly all of which were for settlements of certain antitrust claims with ibm, novell, gateway, and end-user class action plaintiffs, and increases in contingency reserves for anti-trust related claims. general and administrative costs increased in fiscal year 2004 primarily due to legal expenses including $1.92 billion of charges related to the sun microsystems settlement, a $605 million fine imposed by the european commission, and other legal costs of approximately $104 million; $280 million of stock-based compensation expense related to the employee stock option transfer program in the second quarter of fiscal year 2004; and other headcount-related costs.  \u00a0 investment income  \u00a0 the components of investment income and other in each full fiscal year are as follows:  \u00a0 \u00a0 dividends and interest income declined $432 million in fiscal year 2005 due to the combination of a greater allocation of funds to lower yielding, more liquid asset classes in preparation for the $32.64 billion special dividend paid on december 2, 2004 and a lower portfolio balance following payment of the special dividend.  net gains on investments declined $707 million in fiscal year 2005 due primarily to greater sales of investments in the previous fiscal year in preparation for the special dividend paid on december 2, 2004. net gains on investments also include other-than-temporary impairments of $152 million in fiscal year 2005 compared to $82 million fiscal year 2004. investments are considered to be impaired when a decline in fair value is judged to be other than temporary. we employ a systematic methodology that considers available evidence in evaluating potential impairment of our investments. if the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value, we evaluate, among other factors, general market conditions, the duration and extent to which the fair value is less than cost, and our intent and ability to hold the investment. we also consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of and business outlook for the investee, including industry and sector performance, changes in technology, operational and financing cash flow factors, and rating agency actions. once a decline in fair value is determined to be other than temporary, an impairment charge is recorded and a new cost basis in the investment is established.  derivative instruments are used to manage exposures to interest rates, equity prices, and foreign currency exchange rates and to facilitate portfolio diversification. net derivative losses in fiscal year 2005 were primarily related to losses on equity derivatives, interest rate derivatives, and foreign currency contracts. during fiscal year 2005, losses related to equity derivatives used to economically hedge against a decline in equity prices were $202 million and losses related to interest rate derivatives were $53 million. these losses were offset by the combination of realized gains on sales of securities and unrealized gains related to increases in the market value of the underlying assets included as a component of other comprehensive income. net losses related to foreign currency contracts were $53 million, related in part to hedging anticipated foreign currency revenues while the u.s. dollar generally declined against most currencies during the current fiscal year, and economically hedging foreign currency based investment exposures. losses related to hedging foreign currency-based investment exposures were offset by unrealized gains in the underlying assets. net gains on derivatives also included gains related to commodity positions used to provide portfolio diversification. gains on commodity positions were $46 million during fiscal year 2005.  in fiscal year 2004, dividends and interest income decreased by $65 million mainly due to lower dividend income resulting from the exchange of at&t 5% convertible preferred debt for common shares of comcast during fiscal year 2003 and declining interest rates, partly offset by a larger investment portfolio. net gains on investments include   \u00a0  table of contents \u00a0part ii\u00a0  item 7  \u00a0 \u00a0  other-than-temporary impairments of $82 million in fiscal year 2004 compared to $1.15 billion in fiscal year 2003 and higher net realized gains on sales in fiscal year 2004 as we moved to more liquid investment asset classes. net realized gains on sales were $1.65 billion in fiscal year 2004 and $1.19 billion in fiscal year 2003. the decline in impairments was due to improved market conditions. derivative losses decreased $156 million to $268 million in fiscal year 2004 compared to fiscal year 2003 primarily due to the combined effects of interest rate movements on interest rate sensitive instruments and equity market price movements relative to positions used to hedge the fair value of certain equity securities.  net losses on equity investees and other for the previous periods were reclassified into investment income and other to conform to the current period presentation.  \u00a0 income taxes  \u00a0 our effective tax rate for the full fiscal year 2005 was 26% compared with 33% for fiscal year 2004. the decreased rate for the full year resulted primarily from the reversal of $776 million of previously accrued taxes upon settling an internal revenue service examination for fiscal years 1997 to 1999 and recording a tax benefit of $179 million generated by the decision to repatriate foreign subsidiary earnings under a temporary incentive provided by the american jobs creation act of 2004. the effective tax rate for fiscal year 2003 was 32%. the fiscal year 2003 rate reflected a benefit in the second quarter of $126 million which resulted from the reversal of previously accrued taxes that were related to a previous unfavorable tax court ruling, portions of which were reversed in 2003 by the ninth circuit court of appeals.  \u00a0 financial condition  \u00a0 cash and short-term investments totaled $37.75 billion as of june 30, 2005 compared to $60.59 billion as of june 30, 2004. the decline is primarily attributable to the special dividend of $3.00 per share, or $32.64 billion, paid on december 2, 2004, and to common stock repurchases of 312 million shares for $8.0 billion during 2005. equity and other investments were $11.00 billion as of june 30, 2005 compared to $12.21 billion as of june 30, 2004. the investment portfolio consists primarily of fixed-income securities, diversified among industries and individual issuers. our investments are generally liquid and investment grade. the portfolio is invested predominantly in u.s. dollar denominated securities, but also includes foreign currency denominated positions in order to diversify financial risk. the portfolio is primarily invested in short-term securities to facilitate rapid deployment for immediate cash needs. as a result of the special dividend and shares repurchased, our retained deficit, including accumulated other comprehensive income, was $12.30 billion at june 30, 2005. our retained deficit is not expected to impact our future ability to operate or pay dividends given our continuing profitability and strong cash and financial position.  \u00a0 unearned revenue  \u00a0 unearned revenue is attributable to volume licensing programs, undelivered elements of software licensing arrangements, and certain other services. unearned revenue from volume licensing programs represents customer billings, paid either upfront or at the beginning of each billing coverage period, that are accounted for as subscriptions with revenue recognized ratably over the billing coverage period. for certain other licensing arrangements revenue attributable to undelivered elements, including free post-delivery telephone support and the right to receive unspecified upgrades/enhancements of microsoft internet explorer on a when-and-if-available basis, is based on the sales price of those elements when sold separately and is recognized ratably on a straight-line basis over the related product\u0092s life cycle. other unearned revenue includes services, tv platform, microsoft business solutions, and advertising and subscription services where we have been paid upfront and earn the revenue when we provide the service or software or otherwise meet the revenue recognition criteria.  unearned revenue as of june 30, 2005 increased $990 million from june 30, 2004 reflecting current period billings outpacing the recognition of deferrals from multi-year licensing arrangements by $925 million and a $304 million increase primarily in unearned revenue for services, msn advertising and subscriptions, xbox live, tv platform, and microsoft business solutions, partially offset by a $239 million decline in revenue deferred for undelivered elements.  \u00a0  table of contents \u00a0part ii\u00a0  item 7  \u00a0 \u00a0 the following table outlines the expected recognition of unearned revenue at june 30, 2005:  \u00a0 \u00a0 cash flows  \u00a0 cash flow from operations for fiscal year 2005 increased 14% to $16.61 billion due primarily to an increase in cash receipts from customers driven by our 8% revenue growth combined with a 12% increase in unearned revenue. cash payments in fiscal year 2005 resulting from significant legal settlements were approximately $1.8 billion lower than in the previous year, adding to the overall increase in operating cash flow. partially offsetting these factors were increased payments to employees resulting from a 7% increase in full-time employees. cash used for financing was $41.08 billion in fiscal year 2005, driven by $36.11 billion of cash dividends paid in fiscal year 2005 compared to $1.73 billion paid in fiscal year 2004. the increase was also partially driven by $8.0 billion in cash used for common stock repurchases, an increase of $4.67 billion in cash used for share repurchases compared to the previous year, reflecting 312 million shares repurchased in fiscal year 2005, an increase of 188.5 million shares compared to the previous year. net cash from investing was $15.03 billion in fiscal year 2005, an increase of $18.37 billion from fiscal year 2004, primarily due to a $23.59 billion increase in investment maturities that occurred to fund cash dividends paid in fiscal year 2005, partially offset by a $5.32 billion decrease in cash from combined investment purchase and sale activity.  cash flow from operations for fiscal year 2004 decreased $1.17 billion to $14.63 billion. the decrease primarily reflects the combined cash outflows of $2.56 billion related to the sun microsystems settlement and the european commission fine partially offset by increased cash receipts from customers driven by the rise in revenue billings. cash used for financing was $2.36 billion in fiscal year 2004, a decrease of $2.86 billion from the previous year. the decrease reflects that we did not repurchase common stock in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2004 combined with a $628 million increase primarily from stock issuances related to employee stock options exercises, partially offset by an $872 million increase in cash dividends paid. we repurchased 123.7 million shares of common stock under our share repurchase program in fiscal year 2004. cash used for investing was $3.34 billion in fiscal year 2004, a decrease of $3.88 billion from fiscal year 2003.  cash flow from operations was $15.80 billion for fiscal year 2003, an increase of $1.29 billion from fiscal year 2002. the increase primarily reflects the rise in cash receipts from customers driven by the increase in revenue billings and maintenance of relatively stable accounts receivable levels. cash used for financing was $5.22 billion in fiscal year 2003, an increase of $651 million from the previous year. the increase reflects a cash dividend payment of $857 million in 2003 and an increase of $417 million in common stock repurchased, offsetting $623 million received from common stock issued. we repurchased 238.2 million shares of common stock under our share repurchase program in fiscal year 2003. cash used for investing was $7.50 billion in fiscal year 2003, a decrease of $3.37 billion from fiscal year 2002, due to stronger portfolio performance on sold and matured investments.  we have no material long-term debt. stockholders\u0092 equity at june 30, 2005 was $48.12 billion. we will continue to invest in sales, marketing, product support infrastructure, and existing and advanced areas of technology. additions to property and equipment will continue, including new facilities and computer systems for research and development, sales and marketing, support, and administrative staff. commitments for constructing new buildings were $152 million on june 30, 2005. we have operating leases for most u.s. and international sales and support offices and certain equipment under which we incurred rental expense totaling, $290 million, $331 million and $299 million in fiscal year 2003, 2004 and 2005, respectively. we have issued residual value guarantees in connection with various operating leases. these guarantees provide that if we do not purchase the leased property from the   \u00a0  table of contents \u00a0part ii\u00a0  item 7  \u00a0 \u00a0  lessor at the end of the lease term, then we are liable to the lessor for an amount equal to the shortage (if any) between the proceeds from the sale of the property and an agreed value. as of june 30, 2005, the maximum amount of the residual value guarantees was approximately $271 million. we believe that proceeds from the sale of properties under operating leases would exceed the payment obligation and therefore no liability currently exists. we have not engaged in any related party transactions or arrangements with unconsolidated entities or other persons that are reasonably likely to materially affect liquidity or the availability of requirements for capital resources.  in fiscal year 2005, our board of directors approved $3.40 per share cash dividends, with $3.32 paid as of june 30, 2005. a quarterly dividend of $0.08 per share (or approximately $857 million) was approved by our board of directors on june 15, 2005 to be paid to shareholders of record as of august 17, 2005 on september 8, 2005.  on july 20, 2004, our board of directors approved a plan to buy back up to $30 billion in microsoft common stock over four years. the specific timing and amount of repurchases will vary based on market conditions, securities law limitations, and other factors. the repurchases will be made using our cash resources. the repurchase program may be suspended or discontinued at any time without previous notice. in any period, cash used in financing activities related to common stock repurchased may differ from the comparable change in stockholders\u0092 equity, reflecting timing differences between the recognition of share repurchase transactions and their settlement for cash. during fiscal year 2005, we repurchased 312 million shares, or $8.0 billion of our common stock under this plan.  we believe existing cash and short-term investments, together with funds generated from operations should be sufficient to meet operating requirements, quarterly dividends and planned share repurchases. our philosophy regarding the maintenance of a balance sheet with a large component of cash and short-term investments, and equity and other investments, reflects our views on potential future capital requirements relating to research and development, creation and expansion of sales distribution channels, investments and acquisitions, share dilution management, legal risks, and challenges to our business model. we regularly assess our investment management approach in view of our current and potential future needs.  \u00a0 off-balance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations  \u00a0 off-balance sheet arrangements  \u00a0 as of june 30, 2004, we had guaranteed the repayment of certain japanese yen denominated bank loans and related interest and fees of jupiter telecommunication, ltd., a japanese cable company. the total amount of these guarantees was approximately $51 million. effective december 21, 2004, the guarantees were terminated.  we provide indemnifications of varying scope and amount to certain customers against claims of intellectual property infringement made by third parties arising from the use of our products. we evaluate estimated losses for such indemnifications under sfas no. 5, accounting for contingencies, as interpreted by fasb interpretation no. (fin) 45. we consider factors such as the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss. to date, we have not encountered material costs as a result of such obligations and have not accrued any liabilities related to such indemnifications in our financial statements.  \u00a0 contractual obligations  \u00a0 the following table summarizes our outstanding contractual obligations as of june 30, 2005:  \u00a0 \u00a0  table of contents \u00a0part ii\u00a0  item 7  \u00a0 \u00a0 recently issued accounting standards  \u00a0 in november 2004, the financial accounting standards board (fasb) issued sfas no. 151, inventory costs, which clarifies the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense, freight, handling costs, and wasted material. sfas no. 151 will be effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after june 15, 2005. we do not believe the adoption of sfas no. 151 will have a material impact on our financial statements.  in december 2004, the fasb issued sfas no. 153, exchanges of nonmonetary assets, which eliminates the exception for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets and replaces it with a general exception for exchanges of nonmonetary assets that do not have commercial substance. sfas no. 153 will be effective for nonmonetary asset exchanges occurring in fiscal periods beginning after june 15, 2005. we do not believe the adoption of sfas no. 153 will have a material impact on our financial statements.  in december 2004, the fasb issued sfas no. 123(r), share-based payment, which establishes standards for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services. this standard requires an issuer to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant-date fair value of the award. this eliminates the exception to account for such awards using the intrinsic method previously allowable under accounting principles board (apb) opinion no. 25. in march 2005, the sec released staff accounting bulletin (sab) 107, share-based payment, which expresses views of the sec staff about the application of sfas no. 123(r). in april 2005 the sec issued a rule that sfas no. 123(r) will be effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after june 15, 2005. we previously adopted the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no. 123, accounting for stock-based compensation, on july 1, 2003 and restated previous periods at that time for all awards granted to employees after july 1, 1995. accordingly we believe sfas no. 123(r) will not have a material impact on our financial statements; however, we continue to assess the potential impact that the adoption of sfas no. 123(r) will have on the classification of tax deductions for stock-based compensation in our statements of cash flows.  \u00a0 application of critical accounting policies  \u00a0 our financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with u.s. gaap. preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. these estimates and assumptions are affected by management\u0092s application of accounting policies. critical accounting policies for us include revenue recognition, impairment of investment securities, impairment of goodwill, accounting for research and development costs, accounting for legal contingencies, accounting for income taxes, and accounting for stock-based compensation.  we account for the licensing of software in accordance with american institute of certified public accountants (aicpa) statement of position (sop) 97-2, software revenue recognition. the application of sop 97-2 requires judgment, including whether a software arrangement includes multiple elements, and if so, whether vendor-specific objective evidence (vsoe) of fair value exists for those elements. customers receive certain elements of our products over a period of time. these elements include free post-delivery telephone support and the right to receive unspecified upgrades/enhancements of microsoft internet explorer on a when-and-if-available basis, the fair value of which is recognized over the product\u0092s estimated life cycle. changes to the elements in a software arrangement, the   \u00a0  table of contents \u00a0part ii\u00a0  item 7  \u00a0 \u00a0  ability to identify vsoe for those elements, the fair value of the respective elements, and changes to a product\u0092s estimated life cycle could materially impact the amount of earned and unearned revenue. judgment is also required to assess whether future releases of certain software represent new products or upgrades and enhancements to existing products.  sfas no. 115, accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities, and sec sab 59, accounting for noncurrent marketable equity securities, provide guidance on determining when an investment is other-than-temporarily impaired. investments are reviewed quarterly for indicators of other-than-temporary impairment. this determination requires significant judgment. in making this judgment, we employ a systematic methodology quarterly that considers available quantitative and qualitative evidence in evaluating potential impairment of our investments. if the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value, we evaluate, among other factors, general market conditions, the duration and extent to which the fair value is less than cost, and our intent and ability to hold the investment. we also consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of and business outlook for the investee, including industry and sector performance, changes in technology, operational and financing cash flow factors, and rating agency actions. once a decline in fair value is determined to be other-than-temporary, an impairment charge is recorded and a new cost basis in the investment is established. if market, industry and/or investee conditions deteriorate, we may incur future impairments.  sfas no. 142, goodwill and other intangible assets, requires that goodwill be tested for impairment at the reporting unit level (operating segment or one level below an operating segment) on an annual basis (july 1 for us) and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. these events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate, legal factors, operating performance indicators, competition, sale or disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit. application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment, including the identification of reporting units, assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units, assignment of goodwill to reporting units, and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit. the fair value of each reporting unit is estimated using a discounted cash flow methodology. this requires significant judgments including estimation of future cash flows, which is dependent on internal forecasts, estimation of the long-term rate of growth for our business, the useful life over which cash flows will occur, and determination of our weighted average cost of capital. changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and/or goodwill impairment for each reporting unit.  we account for research and development costs in accordance with several accounting pronouncements, including sfas no. 2, accounting for research and development costs, and sfas no. 86, accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold, leased, or otherwise marketed. sfas no. 86 specifies that costs incurred internally in researching and developing a computer software product should be charged to expense until technological feasibility has been established for the product. once technological feasibility is established, all software costs should be capitalized until the product is available for general release to customers. judgment is required in determining when technological feasibility of a product is established. we have determined that technological feasibility for our software products is reached shortly before the products are released to manufacturing. costs incurred after technological feasibility is established are not material, and accordingly, we expense all research and development costs when incurred.  the outcomes of legal proceedings and claims brought against us are subject to significant uncertainty. sfas no.\u00a05, accounting for contingencies, requires that an estimated loss from a loss contingency such as a legal proceeding or claim should be accrued by a charge to income if it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. disclosure of a contingency is required if there is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss has been incurred. in determining whether a loss should be accrued we evaluate, among other factors, the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss. changes in these factors could materially impact our financial position or our results of operations.  sfas no. 109, accounting for income taxes, establishes financial accounting and reporting standards for the effect of income taxes. the objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entity\u0092s financial statements or tax returns. judgment is required in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns. variations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could materially impact our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.  \u00a0  table of contents \u00a0part ii\u00a0  item 7a  \u00a0 \u00a0 management began using a 1-day var for internal risk measurement purposes effective for the quarter-ended march 31, 2005. the effect of changing from 20-day var to 1-day var was not material and there have been no modifications to the assumptions or parameters within the model. the following table sets forth the 1-day var for substantially all of our positions.  \u00a0 \u00a0 the total 1-day var for the combined risk categories was $195 million at june 30, 2005 and $187 million at june 30, 2004. the total var is 39% less at june 30, 2005 and 35% less at june, 30 2004 than the sum of the separate risk categories for each of those years in the above table, due to the diversification benefit of the combination of risks.  \u00a0  ", "table": [{"0": [["In millions except percentages", "2003", "2004", "PercentChange", "2005",
