 table of contents     part i  item 1a      challenges to our business models may reduce our revenue or operating margins.    whether our software runs in the cloud or on a device, we continue to face challenges from alternative means of developing and licensing software. under our license-based software model, software developers bear the costs of converting original ideas into software products through investments in research and development, offsetting these costs with the revenue received from the distribution of their products. certain open source software business models challenge our license-based software model. open source commonly refers to software whose source code is subject to a license allowing it to be modified, combined with other software and redistributed, subject to restrictions set forth in the license. some companies compete with us using an open source business model by modifying and then distributing open source software to end users at nominal cost and earning revenue on complementary services and products. these firms do not bear the full costs of research and development for the software. in some cases, their products may infringe our patents. in addition, advertising-based business models seek revenue by delivering third party advertisements to end customers who receive the software and services at no direct costs. gains in market acceptance of open source or advertising based software may adversely affect our sales, revenue, and operating margins.  an important element of our business model has been to create platform-based ecosystems on which many participants can build diverse solutions. a competing vertically-integrated model, in which a single firm controls both the software and hardware elements of a product, has been successful with certain consumer products such as personal computers, mobile phones, and digital music players. we also offer vertically-integrated hardware and software products; however, efforts to compete with the vertically integrated model may increase our cost of sales and reduce our operating margins.  we derive substantial revenue from licenses of windows operating systems on personal computers. the proliferation of alternative devices and form factors creates challenges from competing software platforms. it is uncertain to what extent alternative devices will increase the number of computing devices that users own, or will substitute for users personal computer purchases. alternative devices also run operating systems and applications developed by our competitors. these factors could impact our revenue and margins.  we face intense competition.    we continue to experience intense competition across all markets for our products and services. our competitors range in size from fortune 100 companies to small, specialized single-product businesses and open source community-based projects. although we believe the breadth of our businesses and product portfolio is a competitive advantage, our competitors that are focused on narrower product lines may be more effective in devoting technical, marketing, and financial resources to compete with us. in addition, barriers to entry in our businesses generally are low and products, once developed, can be distributed broadly and quickly at relatively low cost. open source software vendors are devoting considerable efforts to developing software that mimics the features and functionality of our products, in some cases in violation of our intellectual property rights or on the basis of technical specifications for microsoft technologies that we make available at little or no cost in connection with our interoperability initiatives. in response to competition, we continue to develop versions of our products with basic functionality that are sold at lower prices than the standard versions. these competitive pressures may result in decreased sales volumes, price reductions, and/or increased operating costs, such as for marketing and sales incentives, resulting in lower revenue, gross margins, and operating income.  we may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property rights.    protecting our global intellectual property rights and combating unlicensed copying and use of software and other intellectual property is difficult. while piracy adversely affects u.s. revenue, the impact on revenue from outside the u.s. is more significant, particularly in countries where laws are less protective of intellectual property rights. as a result, our revenue in these markets likely will grow slower than the underlying pc market. similarly, the absence of harmonized patent laws makes it more difficult to ensure consistent respect for patent rights. throughout the world, we actively educate consumers about the benefits of licensing genuine products and obtaining indemnification benefits for intellectual property risks, and we educate lawmakers about the advantages of a business climate where intellectual property rights are protected. however, continued educational and enforcement efforts may fail to enhance revenue. reductions in the legal protection for software intellectual property rights could adversely affect revenue.  third parties may claim we infringe their intellectual property rights.    from time to time, we receive notices from others claiming we infringe their intellectual property rights. because of constant technological change in the    15 



 table of contents     part i  item 1a       segments in which we compete, the extensive patent coverage of existing technologies, and the rapid rate of issuance of new patents, it is possible the number of these claims may grow. to resolve these claims we may enter into royalty and licensing agreements on less favorable terms, stop selling or redesign affected products, or pay damages to satisfy indemnification commitments with our customers. such agreements may cause operating margins to decline. we have made and expect to continue making significant expenditures to settle claims related to the use of technology and intellectual property rights as part of our strategy to manage this risk.  we may not be able to protect our source code from copying if there is an unauthorized disclosure of source code.    source code, the detailed program commands for our operating systems and other software programs, is critical to our business. although we license portions of our application and operating system source code to a number of licensees, we take significant measures to protect the secrecy of large portions of our source code. if an unauthorized disclosure of a significant portion of our source code occurs, we could potentially lose future trade secret protection for that source code. this could make it easier for third parties to compete with our products by copying functionality, which could adversely affect our revenue and operating margins. unauthorized disclosure of source code also could increase the security risks described in the next paragraph.  security vulnerabilities could lead to reduced revenue, liability claims, or competitive harm.    maintaining the security of computers and computer networks is paramount for us and our customers. hackers develop and deploy viruses, worms, and other malicious software programs that attack our products and services and gain access to our networks and data centers. although this is an industry-wide problem that affects computers across all platforms, it affects our products and services in particular because hackers tend to focus their efforts on the most popular operating systems, programs, and services, and we expect them to continue to do so. groups of hackers may also act in a coordinated manner to launch distributed denial of service attacks, or other coordinated attacks, that may cause service outages or other interruptions. we devote significant resources to address security vulnerabilities through:              the cost of these steps could reduce our operating margins. despite these efforts, actual or perceived security vulnerabilities in our products and services could cause significant reputational harm and lead some customers to seek to return products, to reduce or delay future purchases or adoption of services, or to use competing products. customers may also increase their expenditures on protecting their existing computer systems from attack, which could delay adoption of new technologies. any of these actions by customers could adversely affect our revenue. actual or perceived vulnerabilities may lead to claims against us. although our license agreements typically contain provisions that eliminate or limit our exposure to such liability, there is no assurance these provisions will withstand all legal challenges.  in addition, our internal information technology environment continues to evolve. we are often early adopters of new devices and technologies. we embrace new ways of sharing data and communicating with partners and customers using methods such as social networking. these practices can enhance efficiency and business insight, but they also present risks that our business policies and internal security controls may not keep pace with the speed of these changes. if third parties gain access to our networks or data centers, they could obtain and exploit confidential business information and harm our competitive position.    16 



 table of contents     part i  item 1a      improper disclosure of personal data could result in liability and harm our reputation.    as we continue to execute our strategy of increasing the number and scale of our cloud-based offerings, we store and process increasingly large amounts of personally identifiable information of our customers. at the same time, the continued occurrence of high-profile data breaches provides evidence of an external environment increasingly hostile to information security. this environment demands that we continuously improve our design and coordination of security controls across our business groups and geographies. despite these efforts, it is possible our security controls over personal data, our training of employees and vendors on data security, and other practices we follow may not prevent the improper disclosure of personally identifiable information. improper disclosure of this information could harm our reputation, lead to legal exposure to customers, or subject us to liability under laws that protect personal data, resulting in increased costs or loss of revenue. our software products and services also enable our customers to store and process personal data on premises or, increasingly, in a cloud-based environment we host. we believe consumers using our email, messaging, storage, sharing, and social networking services will increasingly want efficient, centralized methods of choosing their privacy preferences and controlling their data. perceptions that our products or services do not adequately protect the privacy of personal information could inhibit sales of our products or services, and could constrain consumer and business adoption of cloud-based solutions.  we may experience outages, data loss and disruptions of our online services if we fail to maintain an adequate operations infrastructure.    our increasing user traffic and complexity of our products and services demand more computing power. we have spent and expect to continue to spend substantial amounts to purchase or lease data centers and equipment and to upgrade our technology and network infrastructure to handle increased traffic on our web sites and in our data centers, and to introduce new products and services and support existing services such as bing, exchange online, office 365, sharepoint online, xbox live, windows azure, windows live, and microsoft office web apps. we also are growing our business of providing a platform and back-end hosting for services provided by third-party businesses to their end customers. maintaining and expanding this infrastructure is expensive and complex. inefficiencies or operational failures, including temporary or permanent loss of customer data, could diminish the quality of our products, services, and user experience resulting in contractual liability, claims by customers and other third parties, damage to our reputation and loss of current and potential users, subscribers, and advertisers, each of which may harm our operating results and financial condition.  we are subject to government litigation and regulatory activity that affects how we design and market our products.    as a leading global software maker, we receive close scrutiny from government agencies under u.s. and foreign competition laws. some jurisdictions also provide private rights of action for competitors or consumers to assert claims of anti-competitive conduct. for example, we have been involved in the following actions.  lawsuits brought by the u.s. department of justice, 18 states, and the district of columbia in two separate actions were resolved through a consent decree that took effect in 2001 and a final judgment entered in 2002. these proceedings imposed various constraints on our windows operating system businesses. these constraints included limits on certain contracting practices, mandated disclosure of certain software program interfaces and protocols, and rights for computer manufacturers to limit the visibility of certain windows features in new pcs. although the consent decree and final judgment expired in may 2011, we expect that federal and state antitrust authorities will continue to closely scrutinize our business.  the european commission closely scrutinizes the design of high-volume microsoft products and the terms on which we make certain technologies used in these products, such as file formats, programming interfaces, and protocols, available to other companies. in 2004, the commission ordered us to create new versions of windows that do not include certain multimedia technologies and to provide our competitors with specifications for how to implement certain proprietary windows communications protocols in their own products. in 2009, the commission accepted a set of commitments offered by microsoft to address the commissions concerns relating to competition in web browsing software. the commissions impact on product design may limit our ability to innovate in windows or other products in the future, diminish the developer appeal of the windows platform, and increase our product development costs. the availability of licenses related to protocols and file formats may enable competitors to develop software products that better mimic the functionality of our own products which could result in decreased sales of our products.    17 



 table of contents     part i  item 1a      government regulatory actions and court decisions such as these may hinder our ability to provide the benefits of our software to consumers and businesses, thereby reducing the attractiveness of our products and the revenue that come from them. new actions could be initiated at any time, either by these or other governments or private claimants, including with respect to new versions of windows or other microsoft products. the outcome of such actions, or steps taken to avoid them, could adversely affect us in a variety of ways, including:        our software and services online offerings are subject to government regulation of the internet domestically and internationally in many areas, including user privacy, telecommunications, data protection, and online content. the application of these laws and regulations to our business is often unclear and sometimes may conflict. compliance with these regulations may involve significant costs or require changes in business practices that result in reduced revenue. noncompliance could result in penalties being imposed on us or orders that we stop the alleged noncompliant activity.  our business depends on our ability to attract and retain talented employees.    our business is based on successfully attracting and retaining talented employees. the market for highly skilled workers and leaders in our industry is extremely competitive. we are limited in our ability to recruit internationally by restrictive domestic immigration laws. if we are less successful in our recruiting efforts, or if we are unable to retain key employees, our ability to develop and deliver successful products and services may be adversely affected. effective succession planning is also important to our long-term success. failure to ensure effective transfer of knowledge and smooth transitions involving key employees could hinder our strategic planning and execution.  delays in product development schedules may adversely affect our revenue.    the development of software products is a complex and time-consuming process. new products and enhancements to existing products can require long development and testing periods. our increasing focus on cloud-based software plus services also presents new and complex development issues. significant delays in new product or service releases or significant problems in creating new products or services could adversely affect our revenue.  we make significant investments in new products and services that may not be profitable.    our growth depends on our ability to innovate by offering new, and adding value to our existing, software and service offerings. we will continue to make significant investments in research, development, and marketing for new products, services, and technologies, including the windows pc operating system, the microsoft office system, bing, windows phone, windows server, windows live, the windows azure services platform and other cloud-based services offerings, and the xbox 360 entertainment platform. investments in new technology are speculative. commercial success depends on many factors, including innovativeness, developer support, and effective distribution and marketing. our degree of success with windows phone, for example, will impact our ability to grow our share of the smartphone operating system market. it will also be an important factor in supporting our strategy of delivering value to end users seamlessly over pc, phone, and tv device classes. if customers do not perceive our latest offerings as providing significant new functionality or other value, they may reduce their purchases of new software products or upgrades, unfavorably impacting revenue. we may not achieve significant revenue from new product and service investments for a number of years, if at all. moreover, new products and services may not be profitable, and even if they are profitable, operating margins for new products and businesses may not be as high as the margins we have experienced historically.  adverse economic conditions may harm our business.    unfavorable changes in economic conditions, including inflation, recession, or other changes in economic conditions, may result in lower information technology spending and adversely affect our revenue. if demand for pcs, servers, and other computing devices declines, or consumer or    18 



 table of contents     part i  item 1a       business spending for those products declines, our revenue will be adversely affected. our product distribution system also relies on an extensive partner network. the impact of economic conditions on our partners, such as the bankruptcy of a major distributor, could result in sales channel disruption. challenging economic conditions also may impair the ability of our customers to pay for products and services they have purchased. as a result, reserves for doubtful accounts and write-offs of accounts receivable may increase. we maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings, types, and maturities. these investments are subject to general credit, liquidity, market, and interest rate risks, which may be exacerbated by unusual events that have affected global financial markets. a significant part of our investment portfolio consists of u.s. government securities. if global credit and equity markets experience prolonged periods of decline, or if the u.s. federal government budget process results in a default or downgrade of its debt, our investment portfolio may be adversely impacted and we could determine that more of our investments have experienced an other-than-temporary decline in fair value, requiring impairment charges that could adversely impact our financial results.  we have claims and lawsuits against us that may result in adverse outcomes.    we are subject to a variety of claims and lawsuits. adverse outcomes in some or all of these claims may result in significant monetary damages or injunctive relief that could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business. although management currently believes resolving all of these matters, individually or in the aggregate, will not have a material adverse impact on our financial statements, the litigation and other claims are subject to inherent uncertainties and managements view of these matters may change in the future. a material adverse impact on our financial statements also could occur for the period in which the effect of an unfavorable final outcome becomes probable and reasonably estimable.  we may have additional tax liabilities.    we are subject to income taxes in the u.s. and many foreign jurisdictions. significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes. in the ordinary course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. we regularly are under audit by tax authorities. although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals. the results of an audit or litigation could have a material effect on our financial statements in the period or periods for which that determination is made.  we earn a significant amount of our operating income from outside the u.s., and any repatriation of funds currently held in foreign jurisdictions may result in higher effective tax rates for the company. in addition, there have been proposals to change u.s. tax laws that would significantly impact how u.s. multinational corporations are taxed on foreign earnings. although we cannot predict whether or in what form this proposed legislation may pass, if enacted it could have a material adverse impact on our tax expense and cash flow.  our vertically-integrated hardware and software products may experience quality or supply problems.    our hardware products such as the xbox 360 console are highly complex and can have defects in design, manufacture, or associated software. we could incur significant expenses, lost revenue, and reputational harm if we fail to detect or effectively address such issues through design, testing, or warranty repairs. we obtain some components of our hardware devices from sole suppliers. if a component delivery from a sole-source supplier is delayed or becomes unavailable or industry shortages occur, we may be unable to obtain timely replacement supplies, resulting in reduced sales. either component shortages or excess or obsolete inventory may increase our cost of revenue. xbox 360 consoles are assembled in asia; disruptions in the supply chain may result in console shortages that would affect our revenue and operating margins. these same risks would apply to any other vertically-integrated hardware and software products we may offer.  if our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets become impaired we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings.    under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states (u.s. gaap), we review our amortizable intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually. factors that may be considered a change in circumstances, indicating that the carrying value of our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets may not be recoverable, include a decline in stock price and market capitalization, reduced future cash flow estimates, and slower growth rates in our industry. we may be required to record a significant charge in our financial statements during the period in which any impairment of our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets is determined, negatively impacting our results of operations.    19

 table of contents     part ii  item 7      industry trends  our industry is dynamic and highly competitive, with frequent changes in both technologies and business models. each industry shift is an opportunity to conceive new products, new technologies, or new ideas which can further transform the industry and our business. at microsoft, we push the boundaries of what is possible through a broad set of research and technology innovations that seek to anticipate the changing demands of customers, industry trends, and competitive forces.  key opportunities and investments  based on our assessment of key technology trends and our broad focus on long-term research and development of new products and services, we see significant opportunities to drive future growth.  smart connected devices  the price per unit of processing, storage, and networks continues to decline while at the same time devices increase in capability. this ongoing trend is increasing the capabilities of pcs, mobile, and other devices powered by rich software platforms and applications. at the same time, the information and services people use increasingly span multiple devices. user experiences will be transformed by the adoption of cloud computing when brought together with the richness of smart, connected devices. microsoft is delivering experiences that seamlessly connect pcs and mobile and other devices through the cloud. we are devoting significant resources to consumer cloud offerings like bing, windows live, and xbox live. our software and hardware platform investments can be seen in products like kinect, windows, windows azure, windows phone, windows server, and xbox.  cloud computing transforming the data center and information technology  cloud-based solutions provide customers with software, services and content over the internet by way of shared computing resources located in centralized data centers. computing is undergoing a long-term shift from client/server to the cloud, a shift similar in importance and impact to the transition from mainframe to client/server. the shift to the cloud is driven by three important economies of scale: larger data centers can deploy computational resources at significantly lower cost than smaller ones; larger data centers include diverse customer, geographic, and application demand patterns which improve the utilization of computing, storage, and network resources; and multi-tenancy lowers application maintenance labor costs for large public clouds. as a result of the improved economics, the cloud offers unique levels of elasticity and agility that will enable new solutions and applications. for businesses of all sizes, the cloud creates the opportunity to focus more on innovation while leaving non-differentiating activities to reliable and cost-effective providers. for most businesses, the first step in achieving cloud economics is the adoption of virtualization in their data center. we are devoting significant resources to developing cloud infrastructure, platforms, and applications including offerings such as microsoft dynamics online, microsoft sql azure, office 365, windows azure, windows intune, and windows server.  entertainment  the evolution of hardware, software, services, and the cloud are enhancing the delivery and quality of unified entertainment experiences across many devices. these rich media experiences include games, movies, music, television, and social interactions with family, friends, and colleagues. at microsoft, our approach is to simplify and increase the accessibility of these entertainment experiences to broaden market penetration of our software and services. we invest significant resources in partnerships, content, windows phone, xbox, and xbox live.  search  over the last two decades, web content and social connections have increased dramatically as people spend more time online, while discoverability and accessibility has been transforming from direct navigation and document links. there is significant opportunity to deliver differentiated products that helps users make better decisions and    23 



 table of contents     part ii  item 7       complete tasks more simply when using pc, mobile, and other devices. our approach is to use machine learning to try to understand user intent, and differentiate our product by focusing on the integration of visual, social, and other elements which simplifies peoples interaction with the internet. we invest significant resources in bing, sharepoint, windows, and windows phone.  communications and productivity  personal and business productivity has been transformed by the ubiquity of computing and software tools. over the last decade, microsoft redefined software productivity beyond the rich office client on the pc. productivity scenarios now encompass unified communications, business intelligence, collaboration, content management, and relationship management, which are increasingly powered by server-side applications. these server applications can be hosted by the customer, a partner, or by microsoft in the cloud. there are significant opportunities to provide productivity and communication scenarios across pcs, mobile devices, and other devices that connect to services. we invest significant resources in dynamics, exchange, lync, office, office 365, sharepoint, and windows live.  economic conditions, challenges and risks  as discussed above, our industry is dynamic and highly competitive. we must anticipate changes in technology and business models. our model for growth is based on our ability to initiate and embrace disruptive technology trends, to enter new markets, both in terms of geographies and product areas, and to drive broad adoption of the products and services we develop and market.  at microsoft, we prioritize our investments among the highest long-term growth opportunities. these investments require significant resources and are multi-year in nature. the products and services we bring to market can be built internally, brought to market as part of a partnership or alliance, or through acquisition.  our success is highly dependent on our ability to attract and retain qualified employees. we rely on hiring from a mix of university and industry talent worldwide. microsoft competes for talented individuals worldwide by offering broad customer reach, scale in resources, and competitive compensation.  demand for our software, services, and hardware has a strong correlation to global macroeconomic factors. the current macroeconomic factors remain dynamic. see a discussion of these factors and other risks under risk factors (part 1, item 1a. of this form 10-k).  seasonality  our revenue historically has fluctuated quarterly and has generally been the highest in the second quarter of our fiscal year due to corporate calendar year-end spending trends in our major markets and holiday season spending by consumers. our entertainment and devices division is particularly seasonal as its products are aimed at the consumer market and are in highest demand during the holiday shopping season. typically, the entertainment and devices division has generated approximately 40% of its yearly segment revenue in our second fiscal quarter. in addition, quarterly revenue may be impacted by the deferral of revenue. see the discussions below regarding sales of earlier versions of the microsoft office system with a guarantee to be upgraded to the newest version of the microsoft office system at minimal or no cost (the office deferral) and sales of windows vista with a guarantee to be upgraded to windows 7 at minimal or no cost and of windows 7 to retailers before general availability (the windows 7 deferral).    24

 table of contents     part ii  item 7      diluted earnings per share increased reflecting increased net income and the repurchase of 380 million shares during fiscal year 2010.  segment product revenue/operating income (loss)  the revenue and operating income (loss) amounts in this section are presented on a basis consistent with accounting principles generally accepted in the u.s. (u.s. gaap) and include certain reconciling items attributable to each of the segments. segment information appearing in note 21  segment information and geographic data of the notes to financial statements (part ii, item 8 of this form 10-k) is presented on a basis consistent with our current internal management reporting. certain corporate-level activity has been excluded from segment operating results and is analyzed separately.  we have recast certain prior period amounts within this md&a to conform to the way we internally managed and monitored segment performance during the current fiscal year, including moving microsofts pc hardware business from entertainment and devices division to windows & windows live division, windows embedded from entertainment and devices division to server and tools, and office for mac from entertainment and devices division to microsoft business division, as well as implementing intersegment cost allocations between all segments related to the collaborative investment in mobile platform development.  windows & windows live division     windows & windows live division (windows division) develops and markets pc operating systems, related software and online services, and pc hardware products. this collection of software, hardware, and services is designed to simplify everyday tasks through efficient browsing capabilities and seamless operations across the users hardware and software. windows division offerings consist of multiple editions of the windows operating system, software and services through windows live, and microsoft pc hardware products.  windows division revenue is largely correlated to the pc market worldwide, as approximately 75% of total windows division revenue comes from windows operating system software purchased by original equipment manufacturers (oems) which they pre-install on equipment they sell. the remaining approximately 25% of windows division revenue (other revenue) is generated by commercial and retail sales of windows and pc hardware products and online advertising from windows live.  fiscal year 2011 compared with fiscal year 2010  windows division revenue reflected relative performance in pc market segments. we estimate that sales of pcs to businesses grew approximately 11% this year and sales of pcs to consumers declined approximately 1%. the decline in consumer pc sales included an approximately 32% decline in the sales of netbooks. taken together, the total pc market increased an estimated 2% to 4%. revenue was negatively impacted by the effect of higher growth in emerging markets, where average selling prices are lower, relative to developed markets, and by lower recognition of previously deferred windows xp revenue. considering the impact of windows 7 launch in the prior year, including $273 million of revenue recognized related to the windows 7 deferral, we estimate that windows division revenue was in line with the pc market.  windows division operating income decreased as a result of decreased revenue and higher sales and marketing expenses. sales and marketing expenses increased $224 million or 8% reflecting increased advertising of windows and windows live.    26

 table of contents     part ii  item 7      fiscal year 2010 compared with fiscal year 2009  windows division revenue increased primarily as a result of strong sales of windows 7 and pc market improvement. we estimate total pc shipments from all sources grew approximately 16% to 18%. oem revenue increased $2.6 billion or 22%, while oem license units increased 21%. the oem revenue increase was driven by pc market growth, higher windows attach rates across consumer and business segments, the restoration of normal oem inventory levels, and the mix of versions of windows licensed, offset in part by pc market changes, including stronger growth of emerging markets versus developed markets and of consumer pcs versus business pcs. fiscal year 2009 oem revenue reflects a $273 million windows 7 deferral. this amount was subsequently recognized in fiscal year 2010. other revenue increased $970 million or 26% driven primarily by windows 7 retail sales.  windows division operating income increased as a result of increased revenue, offset in part by higher operating expenses. sales and marketing expenses increased $258 million or 11% reflecting increased advertising and marketing of windows 7. cost of revenue increased $251 million or 14%, primarily driven by traffic acquisition costs and royalties.  server and tools     server and tools develops and markets technology and related services that enable information technology professionals and their systems to be more productive and efficient. server and tools product and service offerings include windows server, microsoft sql server, windows azure, visual studio, system center products, windows embedded device platforms, and enterprise services. enterprise services comprise premier product support services and microsoft consulting services. we also offer developer tools, training and certification. approximately 50% of server and tools revenue comes primarily from multi-year volume licensing agreements, approximately 30% is purchased through transactional volume licensing programs, retail packaged product and licenses sold to oems, and the remainder comes from enterprise services.  fiscal year 2011 compared with fiscal year 2010  server and tools revenue increased reflecting growth in both product sales and enterprise services. product revenue increased $1.4 billion or 11%, driven primarily by growth in windows server, sql server, enterprise cal suites, and windows embedded, reflecting continued adoption of windows platform applications. enterprise services revenue grew $337 million or 11%, due to growth in both premier product support and consulting services.  server and tools operating income increased due to revenue growth, offset in part by higher operating expenses. cost of revenue increased $366 million or 13%, primarily reflecting a $323 million increase in expenses from providing enterprise services. sales and marketing expenses increased $264 million or 6% reflecting increased fees paid to third party enterprise software advisors and increased corporate marketing activities.  fiscal year 2010 compared with fiscal year 2009  server and tools revenue increased mainly reflecting growth in product revenue. product revenue increased $784 million or 7%, driven primarily by growth in windows server, sql server and enterprise cal suites revenue, reflecting increased revenue from annuity volume licensing agreements and continued adoption of windows platform applications, offset in part by a decline in developer tools revenue. enterprise services revenue was relatively flat, with growth in premier product support services nearly offset by decreased consulting services.    27

 table of contents     part ii  item 7      other income (expense) and income taxes  other income (expense)  the components of other income (expense) were as follows:    we use derivative instruments to manage risks related to foreign currencies, equity prices, interest rates, and credit; to enhance investment returns; and to facilitate portfolio diversification. gains and losses from changes in fair values of derivatives that are not designated as hedges are recognized in other income (expense). these are generally offset by unrealized gains and losses in the underlying securities in the investment portfolio and are recorded as a component of other comprehensive income.  fiscal year 2011 compared with fiscal year 2010  dividends and interest income increased due to higher average portfolio investment balances, offset in part by lower yields on our fixed-income investments. interest expense increased due to our increased issuance of debt. net recognized gains on investments increased due primarily to higher gains on sales of equity securities, offset in part by fewer gains on sales of fixed-income securities. derivative losses decreased due primarily to higher gains on commodity derivatives offset in part by higher losses on currency contracts used to hedge foreign currency revenue.  fiscal year 2010 compared with fiscal year 2009  dividends and interest income increased primarily due to higher average portfolio investment balances, offset in part by lower yields on our fixed-income investments. interest expense increased due to our issuance of long term debt in may 2009. net recognized gains on investments increased primarily due to lower other-than-temporary impairments, offset in part by lower gains on sales of investments in the current period. other-than-temporary impairments were $69 million during fiscal year 2010, as compared with $862 million during fiscal year 2009 and decreased primarily due to improvements in market conditions. net losses on derivatives decreased due to gains on equity and interest rate derivatives as compared to losses in the prior period and lower losses on commodity and foreign currency contracts in the current period. net gains from foreign currency remeasurements were insignificant in fiscal year 2010 compared to net losses of $509 million in the prior year, which had resulted from the strengthening of the u.s. dollar in the prior year. for fiscal year 2010, other includes a gain on the divestiture of razorfish.  income taxes  fiscal year 2011 compared with fiscal year 2010  our effective tax rates for fiscal years 2011 and 2010 were approximately 18% and 25%, respectively. our effective tax rate was lower than the u.s. federal statutory rate and our prior year effective rate primarily due to a higher mix of earnings taxed at lower rates in foreign jurisdictions resulting from producing and distributing our products and services through our foreign regional operations centers in ireland, singapore, and puerto rico, which are subject to    33 



 table of contents     part ii  item 7       lower income tax rates. in fiscal years 2011 and 2010, our u.s. income before income taxes was $8.9 billion and $9.6 billion, respectively, and comprised 32% and 38%, respectively, of our income before income taxes. in fiscal years 2011 and 2010, the foreign income before income taxes was $19.2 billion and $15.4 billion, respectively, and comprised 68% and 62%, respectively, of our income before income taxes. in fiscal years 2011 and 2010, the reduction of the u.s. federal statutory rate as a result of foreign earnings taxed at lower rates was 16% and 12%, respectively.  in addition, our effective tax rate was lower than in the prior year due to a partial settlement with the i.r.s. in the third quarter of fiscal year 2011 relating to the audit of tax years 2004 to 2006. this partial settlement reduced our income tax expense for fiscal year 2011 by $461 million.  tax contingencies and other tax liabilities were $7.4 billion and $6.9 billion as of june 30, 2011 and 2010, respectively, and are included in other long-term liabilities. we have not provided deferred u.s. income taxes or foreign withholding taxes on temporary differences of approximately $44.8 billion resulting from earnings for certain non-u.s. subsidiaries because they are permanently reinvested outside the u.s. the unrecognized deferred tax liability associated with these temporary differences was approximately $14.2 billion as of june 30, 2011.  while we settled a portion of the i.r.s. audit for tax years 2004 to 2006 during the third quarter of fiscal year 2011, we remain under audit for these years. during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2011, the i.r.s. completed its examination and issued a revenue agents report (rar) for the remaining unresolved items. we do not agree with the adjustments in the rar, and we have filed a protest to initiate the administrative appeals process. the proposed adjustments are primarily related to transfer pricing and could have a significant impact on our financial statements if not resolved favorably; however, we believe our existing reserves are adequate. we do not believe it is reasonably possible that the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits will significantly increase or decrease within the next 12 months, as we do not believe the appeals process will be concluded within the next 12 months. we also continue to be subject to examination by the i.r.s. for tax years 2007 to 2010.  fiscal year 2010 compared with fiscal year 2009  our effective tax rates in fiscal years 2010 and 2009 were approximately 25% and 27%, respectively. in fiscal years 2010 and 2009, the reduction to the u.s. federal statutory rate as a result of foreign earnings taxed at lower rates was 12% and 9%, respectively, reflecting the mix of u.s. and international income before income taxes and the impact of changes in unrecognized tax benefits related to international income. in fiscal years 2010 and 2009, foreign income before income taxes was $15.4 billion and $14.3 billion, respectively.  financial condition  cash, cash equivalents, and investments  cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments totaled $52.8 billion as of june 30, 2011, compared with $36.8 billion as of june 30, 2010. equity and other investments were $10.9 billion as of june 30, 2011, compared with $7.8 billion as of june 30, 2010. our short-term investments are primarily to facilitate liquidity and for capital preservation. they consist predominantly of highly liquid investment-grade fixed-income securities, diversified among industries and individual issuers. the investments are predominantly u.s. dollar-denominated securities, but also include foreign currency-denominated securities in order to diversify risk. our fixed-income investments are exposed to interest rate risk and credit risk. the credit risk and average maturity of our fixed-income portfolio are managed to achieve economic returns that correlate to certain fixed-income indices. the settlement risk related to these investments is insignificant given that the short-term investments held are primarily highly liquid investment-grade fixed-income securities. while we own certain mortgage-backed and asset-backed fixed-income securities, our portfolio as of june 30, 2011 does not contain direct exposure to subprime mortgages or structured vehicles that derive their value from subprime collateral. the majority of our mortgage-backed securities are collateralized by prime residential mortgages and carry a 100% principal and interest guarantee, primarily from federal national mortgage association, federal home loan mortgage corporation, and government national mortgage association.    34 



 table of contents     part ii  item 7      of the cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments at june 30, 2011, approximately $45 billion was held by our foreign subsidiaries and were subject to material repatriation tax effects. the amount of cash and investments held by foreign subsidiaries subject to other restrictions on the free flow of funds (primarily currency and other local regulatory) was approximately $379 million. as of june 30, 2011, approximately 68% of the short-term investments held by our foreign subsidiaries were invested in u.s. government and agency securities, approximately 12% were invested in corporate notes and bonds of u.s. companies, and 5% were invested in u.s. mortgage-backed securities, all of which are denominated in u.s. dollars.  securities lending  we lend certain fixed-income and equity securities to increase investment returns. the loaned securities continue to be carried as investments on our balance sheet. cash and/or security interests are received as collateral for the loaned securities with the amount determined based upon the underlying security lent and the creditworthiness of the borrower. cash received is recorded as an asset with a corresponding liability. our securities lending payable balance was $1.2 billion as of june 30, 2011. our average and maximum securities lending payable balances for the fiscal year were $1.6 billion and $3.3 billion, respectively. intra-year variances in the amount of securities loaned are mainly due to fluctuations in the demand for the securities.  valuation  in general, and where applicable, we use quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities to determine the fair value of our financial instruments. this pricing methodology applies to our level 1 investments, such as exchange-traded mutual funds, domestic and international equities, and u.s. treasuries. if quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities are not available to determine fair value, then we use quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities or inputs other than the quoted prices that are observable either directly or indirectly. this pricing methodology applies to our level 2 investments such as corporate notes and bonds, foreign government bonds, mortgage-backed securities, and agency securities. level 3 investments are valued using internally developed models with unobservable inputs. assets and liabilities measured using unobservable inputs are an immaterial portion of our portfolio.  a majority of our investments are priced by pricing vendors and are generally level 1 or level 2 investments as these vendors either provide a quoted market price in an active market or use observable inputs for their pricing without applying significant adjustments. broker pricing is used mainly when a quoted price is not available, the investment is not priced by our pricing vendors, or when a broker price is more reflective of fair values in the market in which the investment trades. our broker-priced investments are generally labeled as level 2 investments because the broker prices these investments based on similar assets without applying significant adjustments. in addition, all of our broker-priced investments have a sufficient level of trading volume to demonstrate that the fair values used are appropriate for these investments. our fair value processes include controls that are designed to ensure appropriate fair values are recorded. these controls include model validation, review of key model inputs, analysis of period-over-period fluctuations, and independent recalculation of prices where appropriate.  cash flows  fiscal year 2011 compared with fiscal year 2010  cash flows from operations increased $2.9 billion during the current fiscal year to $27.0 billion due mainly to increased revenue and cash collections from customers. cash used in financing decreased $4.9 billion to $8.4 billion due mainly to a $5.8 billion increase in proceeds from issuance of debt, net of repayments, offset in part by a $602 million increase in cash paid for dividends. cash used in investing increased $3.3 billion to $14.6 billion due to a $5.8 billion increase in purchases of investments, offset in part by a $2.5 billion increase in cash from securities lending.  fiscal year 2010 compared with fiscal year 2009  cash flow from operations increased $5.0 billion, primarily due to payment of $4.1 billion to the internal revenue service in the prior year as a result of our settlement of the 2000-2003 audit examination along with increased cash received from customers in the current year. cash used for financing increased $5.8 billion, primarily due to a $5.6    35

 table of contents     part ii  item 7      convertible debt  in june 2010, we issued $1.25 billion of zero coupon convertible unsecured debt due on june 15, 2013 in a private placement offering. proceeds from the offering were $1.24 billion, net of fees and expenses, which were capitalized. each $1,000 principal amount of notes is convertible into 29.94 shares of microsoft common stock at a conversion price of $33.40 per share. as of june 30, 2011, the net carrying amount of our convertible debt was $1.2 billion and the unamortized discount was $38 million.  prior to march 15, 2013, the notes will be convertible, only in certain circumstances, into cash and, if applicable, cash, shares of microsofts common stock, or a combination thereof, at our election. on or after march 15, 2013, the notes will be convertible at any time. upon conversion, we will pay cash up to the aggregate principal amount of the notes and pay or deliver cash, shares of our common stock, or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock, at our election.  because the convertible debt may be wholly or partially settled in cash, we are required to separately account for the liability and equity components of the notes in a manner that reflects our nonconvertible debt borrowing rate when interest costs are recognized in subsequent periods. the net proceeds of $1.24 billion were allocated between debt for $1.18 billion and stockholders equity for $58 million with the portion in stockholders equity representing the fair value of the option to convert the debt.  in connection with the issuance of the notes, we entered into capped call transactions with certain option counterparties who are initial purchasers of the notes or their affiliates. the capped call transactions are expected to reduce potential dilution of earnings per share upon conversion of the notes. under the capped call transactions, we purchased from the option counterparties capped call options that in the aggregate relate to the total number of shares of our common stock underlying the notes, with a strike price equal to the conversion price of the notes and with a cap price equal to $37.16. the purchased capped calls were valued at $40 million and recorded to stockholders equity.  unearned revenue  unearned revenue at june 30, 2011 comprised mainly unearned revenue from volume licensing programs. unearned revenue from volume licensing programs represents customer billings for multi-year licensing arrangements paid for either at inception of the agreement or annually at the beginning of each billing coverage period and accounted for as subscriptions with revenue recognized ratably over the billing coverage period. unearned revenue at june 30, 2011 also included payments for: post-delivery support and consulting services to be performed in the future; xbox live subscriptions and prepaid points; microsoft dynamics business solutions products; oem minimum commitments; unspecified upgrades/enhancements of windows phone and microsoft internet explorer on a when-and-if-available basis for windows xp; and other offerings for which we have been paid in advance and earn the revenue when we provide the service or software, or otherwise meet the revenue recognition criteria.  the following table outlines the expected future recognition of unearned revenue as of june 30, 2011:      37

 table of contents     part ii  item 7      share repurchases  on september 22, 2008, we announced the completion of the two repurchase programs approved by our board of directors during the first quarter of fiscal year 2007 (the 2007 programs) to buy back up to $40.0 billion of microsoft common stock. on september 22, 2008, we also announced that our board of directors approved a new share repurchase program authorizing up to $40.0 billion in share repurchases with an expiration date of september 30, 2013 (the 2008 program). as of june 30, 2011, approximately $12.2 billion remained of the $40.0 billion approved repurchase amount. the repurchase program may be suspended or discontinued at any time without notice.  during the periods reported, we repurchased with cash resources: 447 million shares for $11.5 billion during fiscal year 2011; 380 million shares for $10.8 billion during fiscal year 2010; and 318 million shares for $8.2 billion during fiscal year 2009. all shares repurchased in fiscal years 2011 and 2010 were repurchased under the 2008 program. of the shares repurchased in fiscal year 2009, 101 million shares were repurchased for $2.7 billion under the 2007 programs, while the remainder was repurchased under the 2008 program.  dividends  during fiscal years 2011 and 2010, our board of directors declared the following dividends:     off-balance sheet arrangements  we provide indemnifications of varying scope and size to certain customers against claims of intellectual property infringement made by third parties arising from the use of our products and certain other matters. in evaluating estimated losses on these indemnifications, we consider factors such as the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and our ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss. to date, we have not encountered significant costs as a result of these obligations and have not accrued in our financial statements any liabilities related to these indemnifications.    38

 table of contents     part ii  item 7      contractual obligations  the following table summarizes the payments due by fiscal year for our outstanding contractual obligations as of june 30, 2011.      other planned uses of capital  we will continue to invest in sales, marketing, product support infrastructure, and existing and advanced areas of technology. additions to property and equipment will continue, including new facilities, data centers, and computer systems for research and development, sales and marketing, support, and administrative staff. we have operating leases for most u.s. and international sales and support offices and certain equipment. we have not engaged in any related party transactions or arrangements with unconsolidated entities or other persons that are reasonably likely to materially affect liquidity or the availability of capital resources.  definitive agreement with skype  on may 10, 2011, we announced that we had entered into a definitive agreement with skype global s.à.r.l. (skype) under which we would acquire skype, a leading internet communications company, for $8.5 billion in cash. we anticipate the acquisition will extend skypes brand and reach of its network platform, while enhancing our existing portfolio of real-time communications products and services. the acquisition is subject to regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions. we obtained regulatory approval in the u.s. and expect to obtain all remaining required regulatory approvals during calendar year 2011.  liquidity  we earn a significant amount of our operating income outside the u.s., which is deemed to be permanently reinvested in foreign jurisdictions. as a result, as discussed above under cash, cash equivalents, and investments, the majority of our cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments are held by foreign subsidiaries. we currently do not intend nor foresee a need to repatriate these funds. we expect existing domestic cash, cash equivalents,    39 



 table of contents     part ii  item 7       short-term investments, and cash flows from operations to continue to be sufficient to fund our domestic operating activities and cash commitments for investing and financing activities, such as regular quarterly dividends, debt repayment schedules, and material capital expenditures, for at least the next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future. in addition, we expect existing foreign cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, and cash flows from operations to continue to be sufficient to fund our foreign operating activities and cash commitments for investing activities, such as material capital expenditures, for at least the next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future.  should we require more capital in the u.s. than is generated by our operations domestically, for example to fund significant discretionary activities, such as acquisitions of businesses and share repurchases, we could elect to repatriate future earnings from foreign jurisdictions or raise capital in the u.s. through debt or equity issuances. these alternatives could result in higher effective tax rates, increased interest expense, or other dilution of our earnings. we have borrowed funds domestically and continue to have the ability to borrow funds domestically at reasonable interest rates.  as a result of the special dividend paid in the second quarter of fiscal year 2005 and shares repurchased, our retained deficit, including accumulated other comprehensive income, was $6.3 billion at june 30, 2011. our retained deficit is not expected to affect our future ability to operate, pay dividends, or repay our debt given our continuing profitability and strong financial position.  recently issued accounting standards  recently adopted accounting pronouncements  on july 1, 2010, we adopted guidance issued by the financial accounting standards board (fasb) on revenue recognition. under the new guidance on arrangements that include software elements, tangible products that have software components that are essential to the functionality of the tangible product are no longer within the scope of the software revenue recognition guidance, and software-enabled products are now subject to other relevant revenue recognition guidance. additionally, the fasb issued guidance on revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables that are outside the scope of the software revenue recognition guidance. under the new guidance, when vendor specific objective evidence or third party evidence for deliverables in an arrangement cannot be determined, a best estimate of the selling price is required to separate deliverables and allocate arrangement consideration using the relative selling price method. the new guidance includes new disclosure requirements on how the application of the relative selling price method affects the timing and amount of revenue recognition. adoption of the new guidance did not have a material impact on our financial statements.  on july 1, 2010, we adopted new guidance issued by the fasb on the consolidation of variable interest entities. the new guidance requires revised evaluations of whether entities represent variable interest entities, ongoing assessments of control over such entities, and additional disclosures for variable interests. adoption of the new guidance did not have a material impact on our financial statements.  recent accounting pronouncements not yet adopted  in june 2011, the fasb issued guidance on presentation of comprehensive income. the new guidance eliminates the current option to report other comprehensive income and its components in the statement of changes in equity. instead, an entity will be required to present either a continuous statement of net income and other comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements. the new guidance will be effective for us beginning july 1, 2012 and will have presentation changes only. in may 2011, the fasb issued guidance to amend the accounting and disclosure requirements on fair value measurements. the new guidance limits the highest-and-best-use measure to nonfinancial assets, permits certain financial assets and liabilities with offsetting positions in market or counterparty credit risks to be measured at a net basis, and provides guidance on the applicability of premiums and discounts. additionally, the new guidance    40 



 table of contents     part ii  item 7       expands the disclosures on level 3 inputs by requiring quantitative disclosure of the unobservable inputs and assumptions, as well as description of the valuation processes and the sensitivity of the fair value to changes in unobservable inputs. the new guidance will be effective for us beginning january 1, 2012. other than requiring additional disclosures, we do not anticipate material impacts on our financial statements upon adoption. in january 2010, the fasb issued guidance to amend the disclosure requirements related to fair value measurements. the guidance requires the disclosure of roll forward activities on purchases, sales, issuance, and settlements of the assets and liabilities measured using significant unobservable inputs (level 3 fair value measurements). the guidance will become effective for us with the reporting period beginning july 1, 2011. other than requiring additional disclosures, the adoption of this new guidance will not have a material impact on our financial statements.  application of critical accounting policies  our financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states (u.s. gaap). preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. these estimates and assumptions are affected by managements application of accounting policies. critical accounting policies for us include revenue recognition, impairment of investment securities, goodwill, research and development costs, contingencies, income taxes, and stock-based compensation.  revenue recognition  software revenue recognition requires judgment, including whether a software arrangement includes multiple elements, and if so, whether vendor-specific objective evidence (vsoe) of fair value exists for those elements. a portion of revenue may be recorded as unearned due to undelivered elements. changes to the elements in a software arrangement, the ability to identify vsoe for those elements, and the fair value of the respective elements could materially impact the amount of earned and unearned revenue. judgment is also required to assess whether future releases of certain software represent new products or upgrades and enhancements to existing products.  impairment of investment securities  investments are reviewed quarterly for indicators of other-than-temporary impairment. this determination requires significant judgment. in making this judgment, we employ a systematic methodology quarterly that considers available quantitative and qualitative evidence in evaluating potential impairment of our investments. if the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value, we evaluate, among other factors, general market conditions, credit quality of debt instrument issuers, the duration and extent to which the fair value is less than cost, and for equity securities, our intent and ability to hold, or plans to sell, the investment. for fixed-income securities, we also evaluate whether we have plans to sell the security or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery. we also consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of and business outlook for the investee, including industry and sector performance, changes in technology, and operational and financing cash flow factors. once a decline in fair value is determined to be other-than-temporary, an impairment charge is recorded to other income (expense) and a new cost basis in the investment is established. if market, industry, and/or investee conditions deteriorate, we may incur future impairments.  goodwill  we allocate goodwill to reporting units based on the reporting unit expected to benefit from the business combination. we evaluate our reporting units on an annual basis and, if necessary, reassign goodwill using a relative fair value allocation approach. goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level (operating segment or one level below an operating segment) on an annual basis (may 1 for us) and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. these events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate, legal factors, operating performance indicators, competition, or sale or disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit.    41 



 table of contents     part ii  item 7      application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment, including the identification of reporting units, assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units, assignment of goodwill to reporting units, and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit. the fair value of each reporting unit is estimated using a discounted cash flow methodology. this analysis requires significant judgments, including estimation of future cash flows, which is dependent on internal forecasts, estimation of the long-term rate of growth for our business, estimation of the useful life over which cash flows will occur, and determination of our weighted average cost of capital. among our reporting units, the fair value of osd has been the closest to its carrying value. the carrying value of osds goodwill was $6.4 billion as of june 30, 2011.  the estimates used to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit change from year to year based on operating results and market conditions. changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and goodwill impairment for each reporting unit.  research and development costs  costs incurred internally in researching and developing a computer software product are charged to expense until technological feasibility has been established for the product. once technological feasibility is established, all software costs are capitalized until the product is available for general release to customers. judgment is required in determining when technological feasibility of a product is established. we have determined that technological feasibility for our software products is reached after all high-risk development issues have been resolved through coding and testing. generally, this occurs shortly before the products are released to manufacturing. the amortization of these costs is included in cost of revenue over the estimated life of the products.  legal and other contingencies  the outcomes of legal proceedings and claims brought against us are subject to significant uncertainty. an estimated loss from a loss contingency such as a legal proceeding or claim is accrued by a charge to income if it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. disclosure of a contingency is required if there is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss has been incurred. in determining whether a loss should be accrued we evaluate, among other factors, the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss. changes in these factors could materially impact our financial statements.  income taxes  the objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entitys financial statements or tax returns. we recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position should be measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. accounting literature also provides guidance on derecognition of income tax assets and liabilities, classification of current and deferred income tax assets and liabilities, accounting for interest and penalties associated with tax positions, and income tax disclosures. judgment is required in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns. variations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could materially impact our financial statements.  stock-based compensation  stock-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period. determining the fair value of stock-based awards at the grant date requires judgment, including estimating expected dividends. in addition, judgment is also required in estimating the amount of stock-based awards that are expected to be forfeited. if actual results differ significantly from these estimates, stock-based compensation expense and our results of operations could be impacted.    42 



 table of contents     part ii  item 7      statement of managements responsibility for financial statements  management is responsible for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements and related information that are presented in this report. the consolidated financial statements, which include amounts based on managements estimates and judgments, have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america.  the company designs and maintains accounting and internal control systems to provide reasonable assurance at reasonable cost that assets are safeguarded against loss from unauthorized use or disposition, and that the financial records are reliable for preparing financial statements and maintaining accountability for assets. these systems are augmented by written policies, an organizational structure providing division of responsibilities, careful selection and training of qualified personnel, and a program of internal audits.  the company engaged deloitte & touche llp, an independent registered public accounting firm, to audit and render an opinion on the consolidated financial statements and internal control over financial reporting in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board (united states).  the board of directors, through its audit committee, consisting solely of independent directors of the company, meets periodically with management, internal auditors, and our independent registered public accounting firm to ensure that each is meeting its responsibilities and to discuss matters concerning internal controls and financial reporting. deloitte & touche llp and the internal auditors each have full and free access to the audit committee.      43 



 table of contents     part ii  item 7a      item 7a. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk  risks  we are exposed to economic risk from foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, credit risk, equity prices, and commodity prices. a portion of these risks is hedged, but they may impact our financial statements.  foreign currency  certain forecasted transactions, assets, and liabilities are exposed to foreign currency risk. we monitor our foreign currency exposures daily and use hedges where practicable to offset the risks and maximize the economic effectiveness of our foreign currency positions. principal currencies hedged include the euro, japanese yen, british pound, and canadian dollar.  interest rate  our fixed-income portfolio is diversified across credit sectors and maturities, consisting primarily of investment-grade securities. the credit risk and average maturity of the fixed-income portfolio is managed to achieve economic returns that correlate to certain global and domestic fixed-income indices. in addition, we use to be announced forward purchase commitments of mortgage-backed assets to gain exposure to agency and mortgage-backed securities.  equity  our equity portfolio consists of global, developed, and emerging market securities that are subject to market price risk. we manage the securities relative to certain global and domestic indices and expect their economic risk and return to correlate with these indices.  commodity  we use broad-based commodity exposures to enhance portfolio returns and facilitate portfolio diversification. our investment portfolio has exposure to a variety of commodities, including precious metals, energy, and grain. we manage these exposures relative to global commodity indices and expect their economic risk and return to correlate with these indices.  value-at-risk  we use a value-at-risk (var) model to estimate and quantify our market risks. var is the expected loss, for a given confidence level, in the fair value of our portfolio due to adverse market movements over a defined time horizon. the var model is not intended to represent actual losses in fair value, including determinations of other-than-temporary losses in fair value in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states (u.s. gaap), but is used as a risk estimation and management tool. the distribution of the potential changes in total market value of all holdings is computed based on the historical volatilities and correlations among foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, equity prices, and commodity prices, assuming normal market conditions.  the var is calculated as the total loss that will not be exceeded at the 97.5 percentile confidence level or, alternatively stated, the losses could exceed the var in 25 out of 1,000 cases. several risk factors are not captured in the model, including liquidity risk, operational risk, and legal risk.    44

 table of contents     part ii  item 8      notes to financial statements  note 1 - accounting policies  accounting principles  the financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america (u.s. gaap).  principles of consolidation  the financial statements include the accounts of microsoft corporation and its subsidiaries. intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated. equity investments through which we exercise significant influence over but do not control the investee and are not the primary beneficiary of the investees activities are accounted for using the equity method. investments through which we are not able to exercise significant influence over the investee and which do not have readily determinable fair values are accounted for under the cost method.  estimates and assumptions  preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. examples include: estimates of loss contingencies, product warranties, product life cycles, product returns, and stock-based compensation forfeiture rates; assumptions such as the elements comprising a software arrangement, including the distinction between upgrades/enhancements and new products; when technological feasibility is achieved for our products; the potential outcome of future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns; estimating the fair value and/or goodwill impairment for our reporting units; and determining when investment impairments are other-than-temporary. actual results and outcomes may differ from managements estimates and assumptions.  foreign currencies  assets and liabilities recorded in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rate on the balance sheet date. revenue and expenses are translated at average rates of exchange prevailing during the year. translation adjustments resulting from this process are recorded to other comprehensive income (oci).  revenue recognition  revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the fee is fixed or determinable, and collectibility is probable. revenue generally is recognized net of any taxes collected from customers and subsequently remitted to governmental authorities.  revenue for retail packaged products, products licensed to original equipment manufacturers (oems), and perpetual licenses under certain volume licensing programs generally is recognized as products are shipped or made available. revenue for products under technology guarantee programs, which provide free or significantly discounted rights to use upcoming new versions of a software product if an end user licenses existing versions of the product during the eligibility period, is allocated between existing product and the new product, and revenue allocated to the new product is deferred until that version is delivered. the revenue allocation is based on vendor-specific objective evidence of fair value of the products.  certain multi-year licensing arrangements include a perpetual license for current products combined with rights to receive future versions of software products on a when-and-if-available basis (software assurance) and are accounted for as subscriptions, with billings recorded as unearned revenue and recognized as revenue ratably over the billing coverage period. revenue from certain arrangements that allow for the use of a product or service over a    50 



 table of contents     part ii  item 8       period of time without taking possession of software are also accounted for as subscriptions. revenue for software products where customers have the right to receive unspecified upgrades/enhancements on a when-and-if-available basis and for which vendor-specific objective evidence of fair value does not exist for the upgrades/enhancements is recognized on a straight-line basis over the estimated life of the software.  revenue related to our xbox 360 gaming and entertainment console, kinect for xbox 360, games published by us, and other hardware components is generally recognized when ownership is transferred to the resellers. revenue related to games published by third parties for use on the xbox 360 platform is recognized when games are manufactured by the game publishers.  display advertising revenue is recognized as advertisements are displayed. search advertising revenue is recognized when the ad appears in the search results or when the action necessary to earn the revenue has been completed. consulting services revenue is recognized as services are rendered, generally based on the negotiated hourly rate in the consulting arrangement and the number of hours worked during the period. consulting revenue for fixed-price services arrangements is recognized as services are provided. revenue from prepaid points redeemable for the purchase of software or services is recognized upon redemption of the points and delivery of the software or services.  cost of revenue  cost of revenue includes; manufacturing and distribution costs for products sold and programs licensed; operating costs related to product support service centers and product distribution centers; costs incurred to include software on pcs sold by oems, to drive traffic to our web sites, and to acquire online advertising space (traffic acquisition costs); costs incurred to support and maintain internet-based products and services, including royalties; warranty costs; inventory valuation adjustments; costs associated with the delivery of consulting services; and the amortization of capitalized research and development costs. capitalized research and development costs are amortized over the estimated lives of the products.  product warranty  we provide for the estimated costs of fulfilling our obligations under hardware and software warranties at the time the related revenue is recognized. for hardware warranties, we estimate the costs based on historical and projected product failure rates, historical and projected repair costs, and knowledge of specific product failures (if any). the specific hardware warranty terms and conditions vary depending upon the product sold and the country in which we do business, but generally include parts and labor over a period generally ranging from 90 days to three years. for software warranties, we estimate the costs to provide bug fixes, such as security patches, over the estimated life of the software. we regularly reevaluate our estimates to assess the adequacy of the recorded warranty liabilities and adjust the amounts as necessary.  research and development  research and development expenses include payroll, employee benefits, stock-based compensation expense, and other headcount-related expenses associated with product development. research and development expenses also include third-party development and programming costs, localization costs incurred to translate software for international markets, and the amortization of purchased software code and services content. such costs related to software development are included in research and development expense until the point that technological feasibility is reached, which for our software products, is generally shortly before the products are released to manufacturing. once technological feasibility is reached, such costs are capitalized and amortized to cost of revenue over the estimated lives of the products.  sales and marketing  sales and marketing expenses include payroll, employee benefits, stock-based compensation expense, and other headcount-related expenses associated with sales and marketing personnel, and the costs of advertising, promotions, trade shows, seminars, and other programs. advertising costs are expensed as incurred. advertising expense was $1.9 billion, $1.6 billion, and $1.4 billion in fiscal years 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively.    51 



 table of contents     part ii  item 8      employee severance  we record employee severance when a specific plan has been approved by management, the plan has been communicated to employees, and it is unlikely that significant changes will be made to the plan. in january 2009, we announced and implemented a resource management program to reduce discretionary operating expenses, employee headcount, and capital expenditures. severance expenses associated with this program were $59 million and $330 million in fiscal years 2010 and 2009, respectively, and are included in general and administrative expenses.  stock-based compensation  we measure stock-based compensation cost at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and recognize it as expense over the vesting or service period, as applicable, of the stock award (generally four to five years) using the straight-line method.  employee stock purchase plan  shares of our common stock may be purchased by employees at three-month intervals at 90% of the fair market value of the stock on the last day of each three-month period. compensation expense for the employee stock purchase plan is measured as the discount the employee is entitled to upon purchase and is recognized in the period of purchase.  income taxes  income tax expense includes u.s. and international income taxes, the provision for u.s. taxes on undistributed earnings of international subsidiaries not deemed to be permanently invested, and interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions. certain income and expenses are not reported in tax returns and financial statements in the same year. the tax effect of such temporary differences is reported as deferred income taxes. the deferred income taxes are classified as current or long-term based on the classification of the related asset or liability.  fair value measurements  we account for certain assets and liabilities at fair value. the hierarchy below lists three levels of fair value based on the extent to which inputs used in measuring fair value are observable in the market. we categorize each of our fair value measurements in one of these three levels based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. these levels are:        52 



 table of contents     part ii  item 8      we measure certain assets, including our cost and equity method investments, at fair value on a nonrecurring basis when they are deemed to be other-than-temporarily impaired. the fair values of these investments are determined based on valuation techniques using the best information available, and may include quoted market prices, market comparables, and discounted cash flow projections. an impairment charge is recorded when the cost of the investment exceeds its fair value and this condition is determined to be other-than-temporary.  our current financial liabilities have fair values that approximate their carrying values. our long-term financial liabilities consist of long-term debt which is recorded on the balance sheet at issuance price less unamortized discount.  financial instruments  we consider all highly liquid interest-earning investments with a maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase to be cash equivalents. the fair values of these investments approximate their carrying values. in general, investments with original maturities of greater than three months and remaining maturities of less than one year are classified as short-term investments. investments with maturities beyond one year may be classified as short-term based on their highly liquid nature and because such marketable securities represent the investment of cash that is available for current operations. all cash equivalents and short-term investments are classified as available-for-sale and realized gains and losses are recorded using the specific identification method. changes in market value, excluding other-than-temporary impairments, are reflected in oci.  equity and other investments classified as long-term include both debt and equity instruments. debt and publicly-traded equity securities are classified as available-for-sale and realized gains and losses are recorded using the specific identification method. changes in market value, excluding other-than-temporary impairments, are reflected in oci. common and preferred stock and other investments that are restricted for more than one year or are not publicly traded are recorded at cost or using the equity method.  we lend certain fixed-income and equity securities to increase investment returns. the loaned securities continue to be carried as investments on our balance sheet. cash and/or security interests are received as collateral for the loan securities with the amount determined based upon the underlying security lent and the creditworthiness of the borrower. cash received is recorded as an asset with a corresponding liability.  investments are considered to be impaired when a decline in fair value is judged to be other-than-temporary. fair value is calculated based on publicly available market information or other estimates determined by management. we employ a systematic methodology on a quarterly basis that considers available quantitative and qualitative evidence in evaluating potential impairment of our investments. if the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value, we evaluate, among other factors, general market conditions, credit quality of debt instrument issuers, the duration and extent to which the fair value is less than cost, and for equity securities, our intent and ability to hold, or plans to sell, the investment. for fixed-income securities, we also evaluate whether we have plans to sell the security or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery. we also consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of and business outlook for the investee, including industry and sector performance, changes in technology, and operational and financing cash flow factors. once a decline in fair value is determined to be other-than-temporary, an impairment charge is recorded to other income (expense) and a new cost basis in the investment is established.    53

 table of contents     part ii  item 8      derivative instruments are recognized as either assets or liabilities and are measured at fair value. the accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation.  for a derivative instrument designated as a fair-value hedge, the gain (loss) is recognized in earnings in the period of change together with the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item attributed to the risk being hedged. for options designated as fair-value hedges, changes in the time value are excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and are recognized in earnings.  for derivative instruments designated as cash-flow hedges, the effective portion of the derivatives gain (loss) is initially reported as a component of oci and is subsequently recognized in earnings when the hedged exposure is recognized in earnings. for options designated as cash-flow hedges, changes in the time value are excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and are recognized in earnings. gains (losses) on derivatives representing either hedge components excluded from the assessment of effectiveness or hedge ineffectiveness are recognized in earnings.  for derivative instruments that are not designated as hedges, gains (losses) from changes in fair values are primarily recognized in other income (expense). other than those derivatives entered into for investment purposes, such as commodity contracts, the gains (losses) are generally economically offset by unrealized gains (losses) in the underlying available-for-sale securities, which are recorded as a component of oci until the securities are sold or other-than-temporarily impaired, at which time the amounts are moved from oci into other income (expense).  allowance for doubtful accounts  the allowance for doubtful accounts reflects our best estimate of probable losses inherent in the accounts receivable balance. we determine the allowance based on known troubled accounts, historical experience, and other currently available evidence. activity in the allowance for doubtful accounts was as follows:    inventories  inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market, using the average cost method. cost includes materials, labor, and manufacturing overhead related to the purchase and production of inventories. we regularly review inventory quantities on hand, future purchase commitments with our suppliers, and the estimated utility of our inventory. if our review indicates a reduction in utility below carrying value, we reduce our inventory to a new cost basis through a charge to cost of revenue.  property and equipment  property and equipment is stated at cost and depreciated using the straight-line method over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the asset or the lease term. the estimated useful lives of our property and equipment are generally as follows: computer software developed or acquired for internal use, three years; computer equipment, two to three years; buildings and improvements, five to 15 years; leasehold improvements, two to 10 years; and furniture and equipment, one to five years. land is not depreciated.    54 



 table of contents     part ii  item 8      goodwill  goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level (operating segment or one level below an operating segment) on an annual basis (may 1 for us) and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value.  intangible assets  all of our intangible assets are subject to amortization and are amortized using the straight-line method over their estimated period of benefit, ranging from one to 10 years. we evaluate the recoverability of intangible assets periodically by taking into account events or circumstances that may warrant revised estimates of useful lives or that indicate the asset may be impaired.  recently issued accounting standards  recently adopted accounting pronouncements  on july 1, 2010, we adopted guidance issued by the financial accounting standards board (fasb) on revenue recognition. under the new guidance on arrangements that include software elements, tangible products that have software components that are essential to the functionality of the tangible product are no longer within the scope of the software revenue recognition guidance, and software-enabled products are now subject to other relevant revenue recognition guidance. additionally, the fasb issued guidance on revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables that are outside the scope of the software revenue recognition guidance. under the new guidance, when vendor specific objective evidence or third party evidence for deliverables in an arrangement cannot be determined, a best estimate of the selling price is required to separate deliverables and allocate arrangement consideration using the relative selling price method. the new guidance includes new disclosure requirements on how the application of the relative selling price method affects the timing and amount of revenue recognition. adoption of the new guidance did not have a material impact on our financial statements.  on july 1, 2010, we adopted new guidance issued by the fasb on the consolidation of variable interest entities. the new guidance requires revised evaluations of whether entities represent variable interest entities, ongoing assessments of control over such entities, and additional disclosures for variable interests. adoption of the new guidance did not have a material impact on our financial statements.  recent accounting pronouncements not yet adopted  in june 2011, the fasb issued guidance on presentation of comprehensive income. the new guidance eliminates the current option to report other comprehensive income and its components in the statement of changes in equity. instead, an entity will be required to present either a continuous statement of net income and other comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements. the new guidance will be effective for us beginning july 1, 2012 and will have presentation changes only. in may 2011, the fasb issued guidance to amend the accounting and disclosure requirements on fair value measurements. the new guidance limits the highest-and-best-use measure to nonfinancial assets, permits certain financial assets and liabilities with offsetting positions in market or counterparty credit risks to be measured at a net basis, and provides guidance on the applicability of premiums and discounts. additionally, the new guidance expands the disclosures on level 3 inputs by requiring quantitative disclosure of the unobservable inputs and assumptions, as well as description of the valuation processes and the sensitivity of the fair value to changes in unobservable inputs. the new guidance will be effective for us beginning january 1, 2012. other than requiring additional disclosures, we do not anticipate material impacts on our financial statements upon adoption.   55

 table of contents     part ii  item 8      in january 2010, the fasb issued guidance to amend the disclosure requirements related to fair value measurements. the guidance requires the disclosure of roll forward activities on purchases, sales, issuance, and settlements of the assets and liabilities measured using significant unobservable inputs (level 3 fair value measurements). the guidance will become effective for us with the reporting period beginning july 1, 2011. other than requiring additional disclosures, the adoption of this new guidance will not have a material impact on our financial statements.  note 2 - earnings per share  basic earnings per share (eps) is computed based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. diluted eps is computed based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock plus the effect of dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period using the treasury stock method. dilutive potential common shares include outstanding stock options, stock awards, and shared performance stock awards. the components of basic and diluted eps are as follows:     we excluded the following shares underlying stock-based awards from the calculations of diluted eps because their inclusion would have been anti-dilutive:     the decrease in anti-dilutive shares from fiscal year 2009 to 2010 was due mainly to the decrease in employee stock options outstanding.  in june 2010, we issued $1.25 billion of zero-coupon debt securities that are convertible into shares of our common stock if certain conditions are met. as of june 30, 2011, none of these securities had met price or other conditions that would make them eligible for issuance and therefore were excluded from the calculation of either the basic or diluted eps. see note 12  debt for additional information.  note 3 - other income (expense)  the components of other income (expense) were as follows:      56

 table of contents     part ii  item 8      unrealized losses on investments  investments with continuous unrealized losses for less than 12 months and 12 months or greater and their related fair values were as follows:    unrealized losses from fixed-income securities are primarily attributable to changes in interest rates. unrealized losses from domestic and international equities are due to market price movements. management does not believe any remaining unrealized losses represent other-than-temporary impairments based on our evaluation of available evidence as of june 30, 2011.  at june 30, 2011 and 2010, the recorded bases and estimated fair values of common and preferred stock and other investments that are restricted for more than one year or are not publicly traded were $334 million and $216 million, respectively.  debt investment maturities      58 



 table of contents     part ii  item 8      note 5 - derivatives  we use derivative instruments to manage risks related to foreign currencies, equity prices, interest rates, and credit; to enhance investment returns; and to facilitate portfolio diversification. our objectives for holding derivatives include reducing, eliminating, and efficiently managing the economic impact of these exposures as effectively as possible. our derivative programs include strategies that both qualify and do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment. all notional amounts presented below are measured in u.s. currency equivalents.  foreign currency  certain forecasted transactions, assets, and liabilities are exposed to foreign currency risk. we monitor our foreign currency exposures daily to maximize the economic effectiveness of our foreign currency hedge positions. option and forward contracts are used to hedge a portion of forecasted international revenue for up to three years in the future and are designated as cash-flow hedging instruments. principal currencies hedged include the euro, japanese yen, british pound, and canadian dollar. as of june 30, 2011 and 2010, the total notional amounts of these foreign exchange contracts sold were $10.6 billion and $9.3 billion, respectively. foreign currency risks related to certain non-u.s. dollar denominated securities are hedged using foreign exchange forward contracts that are designated as fair-value hedging instruments. as of june 30, 2011 and 2010, the total notional amounts of these foreign exchange contracts sold were $572 million and $523 million, respectively. certain options and forwards not designated as hedging instruments are also used to manage the variability in exchange rates on accounts receivable, cash, and intercompany positions, and to manage other foreign currency exposures. as of june 30, 2011, the total notional amounts of these foreign exchange contracts purchased and sold were $3.9 billion and $7.3 billion, respectively. as of june 30, 2010, the total notional amounts of these foreign exchange contracts purchased and sold were $7.8 billion and $5.3 billion, respectively.  equity  securities held in our equity and other investments portfolio are subject to market price risk. market price risk is managed relative to broad-based global and domestic equity indices using certain convertible preferred investments, options, futures, and swap contracts not designated as hedging instruments. from time to time, to hedge our price risk, we may use and designate equity derivatives as hedging instruments, including puts, calls, swaps, and forwards. as of june 30, 2011, the total notional amounts of designated and non-designated equity contracts purchased and sold were $1.4 billion and $935 million, respectively. as of june 30, 2010, the total notional amounts of designated and non-designated equity contracts purchased and sold were $918 million and $472 million, respectively.  interest rate  securities held in our fixed-income portfolio are subject to different interest rate risks based on their maturities. we manage the average maturity of our fixed-income portfolio to achieve economic returns that correlate to certain broad-based fixed-income indices using exchange-traded option and futures contracts and over-the-counter swap and option contracts, none of which are designated as hedging instruments. as of june 30, 2011, the total notional amounts of fixed-interest rate contracts purchased and sold were $2.3 billion and $2.2 billion, respectively. as of june 30, 2010, the total notional amounts of fixed-interest rate contracts purchased and sold were $3.1 billion and $1.8 billion, respectively. in addition, we use to be announced forward purchase commitments of mortgage-backed assets to gain exposure to agency mortgage-backed securities. these meet the definition of a derivative instrument in cases where physical delivery of the assets is not taken at the earliest available delivery date. as of june 30, 2011 and 2010, the total notional derivative amount of mortgage contracts purchased were $868 million and $305 million, respectively.  credit  our fixed-income portfolio is diversified and consists primarily of investment-grade securities. we use credit default swap contracts, not designated as hedging instruments, to manage credit exposures relative to broad-based indices and to facilitate portfolio diversification. we use credit default swaps as they are a low cost method of managing    59

 table of contents     part ii  item 8      convertible debt  in june 2010, we issued $1.25 billion of zero coupon convertible unsecured debt due on june 15, 2013 in a private placement offering. proceeds from the offering were $1.24 billion, net of fees and expenses, which were capitalized.  each $1,000 principal amount of notes is convertible into 29.94 shares of microsoft common stock at a conversion price of $33.40 per share. as of june 30, 2011, the net carrying amount of our convertible debt was $1.2 billion and the unamortized discount was $38 million.  prior to march 15, 2013, the notes will be convertible, only in certain circumstances, into cash and, if applicable, cash, shares of microsofts common stock, or a combination thereof, at our election. on or after march 15, 2013, the notes will be convertible at any time. upon conversion, we will pay cash up to the aggregate principal amount of the notes and pay or deliver cash, shares of our common stock, or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock, at our election.  because the convertible debt may be wholly or partially settled in cash, we are required to separately account for the liability and equity components of the notes in a manner that reflects our nonconvertible debt borrowing rate when interest costs are recognized in subsequent periods. the net proceeds of $1.24 billion were allocated between debt for $1.18 billion and stockholders equity for $58 million with the portion in stockholders equity representing the fair value of the option to convert the debt.  in connection with the issuance of the notes, we entered into capped call transactions with certain option counterparties who are initial purchasers of the notes or their affiliates. the capped call transactions are expected to reduce potential dilution of earnings per share upon conversion of the notes. under the capped call transactions, we purchased from the option counterparties capped call options that in the aggregate relate to the total number of shares of our common stock underlying the notes, with a strike price equal to the conversion price of the notes and with a cap price equal to $37.16. the purchased capped calls were valued at $40 million and recorded to stockholders equity.  note 13 - income taxes  the components of the provision for income taxes were as follows:    u.s. and international components of income before income taxes were as follows:      69

 table of contents     part ii  item 8      the items accounting for the difference between income taxes computed at the u.s. federal statutory rate and our effective rate were as follows:    the reduction from the federal statutory rate from foreign earnings taxed at lower rates results from producing and distributing our products and services through our foreign regional operations centers in ireland, singapore, and puerto rico, which are subject to lower income tax rates. in general, other reconciling items consist of interest, u.s. state income taxes, domestic production deductions, and credits. in fiscal years 2011, 2010, and 2009, there were no individually significant other reconciling items. the i.r.s. settlement is discussed below.  the components of the deferred income tax assets and liabilities were as follows:    deferred income tax balances reflect the effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases and are stated at enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when the taxes are actually paid or recovered.  we have not provided deferred u.s. income taxes or foreign withholding taxes on temporary differences of approximately $44.8 billion resulting from earnings for certain non-u.s. subsidiaries which are permanently reinvested outside the u.s. the unrecognized deferred tax liability associated with these temporary differences is approximately $14.2 billion.  income taxes paid were $5.3 billion, $4.1 billion, and $6.6 billion in fiscal years 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively.    70

 table of contents     part ii  item 8      uncertain tax positions  as of june 30, 2011, we had $6.9 billion of unrecognized tax benefits of which $5.9 billion, if recognized, would affect our effective tax rate. as of june 30, 2010, we had $6.5 billion of unrecognized tax benefits of which $5.6 billion, if recognized, would have affected our effective tax rate.  interest on unrecognized tax benefits was $38 million, $193 million, and $230 million in fiscal years 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively. as of june 30, 2011, 2010, and 2009, we had accrued interest related to uncertain tax positions of $785 million, $747 million, and $554 million, respectively, net of federal income tax benefits.  the aggregate changes in the balance of unrecognized tax benefits were as follows:    during the third quarter of fiscal year 2011, we reached a partial settlement agreement with the i.r.s. on tax years 2004 to 2006 and recorded a $461 million income tax provision benefit. during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2011, the i.r.s. completed its examination and issued a revenue agents report (rar) for the remaining unresolved items. we do not agree with the adjustments in the rar, and we have filed a protest to initiate the administrative appeals process. the proposed adjustments are primarily related to transfer pricing and could have a significant impact on our financial statements if not resolved favorably. we do not believe it is reasonably possible that the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits will significantly increase or decrease within the next 12 months, as we do not believe the appeals process will be concluded within the next 12 months. we also continue to be subject to examination by the i.r.s. for tax years 2007 to 2010.  we are subject to income tax in many jurisdictions outside the u.s., and certain jurisdictions remain subject to examination and are currently under audit by local tax authorities. the resolutions of these audits are not expected to be material to our financial statements.  note 14 - unearned revenue  unearned revenue comprises mainly unearned revenue from volume licensing programs, as well as payments for offerings for which we have been paid in advance and we earn the revenue when we provide the service or software or otherwise meet the revenue recognition criteria.  volume licensing programs  unearned revenue from volume licensing programs represents customer billings for multi-year licensing arrangements paid either at inception of the agreement or annually at the beginning of each billing coverage period and accounted for as subscriptions with revenue recognized ratably over the billing coverage period.  other  also included in unearned revenue are payments for post-delivery support and consulting services to be performed in the future; xbox live subscriptions and prepaid points; microsoft dynamics business solutions products; technology guarantee programs; oem minimum commitments; unspecified upgrades or enhancements of microsoft internet explorer on a when-and-if-available basis for windows xp; and other offerings for which we have been paid in advance and earn the revenue when we provide the service or software or otherwise meet the revenue recognition criteria.    71

 table of contents     part ii  item 8      indemnifications  we provide indemnifications of varying scope and size to certain customers against claims of intellectual property infringement made by third parties arising from the use of our products and certain other matters. we evaluate estimated losses for these indemnifications, and we consider such factors as the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss. to date, we have not encountered significant costs as a result of these obligations and have not accrued any liabilities related to these indemnifications in our financial statements.  yahoo! commercial agreement  on december 4, 2009, we entered into a definitive agreement with yahoo! whereby microsoft will provide the exclusive algorithmic and paid search platform for yahoo! web sites. the term of the agreement is 10 years subject to termination provisions after five years based on performance.  microsoft provided yahoo! with revenue per search guarantees for a period of 18 months after implementation of the microsoft search ads platform in each country. these guarantees are calculated, paid and trued-up periodically based on the cumulative reduction in revenue per search, if any, during the 18-month period from pre-implementation levels, except in the case of the u.s. and canada where performance during each of the first two calendar quarters after implementation is independent and not cumulative. this is a rate guarantee and not a guarantee of search volume. we estimate the total cost of the revenue per search guarantees during the guarantee period could range up to $150 million.  microsoft also agreed to reimburse yahoo! for certain transition expenses incurred both before and after the effective date of the agreement.  finally, microsoft also agreed to reimburse yahoo! for certain costs of running algorithmic and paid search services prior to migration to microsofts platform.  product warranty  the changes in our aggregate product warranty liabilities, which are included in other current liabilities and other long term-liabilities on our balance sheets, were as follows:    note 17 - contingencies  government competition law matters  since 2001, we have been subject to a consent decree and final judgment (final judgments) that resolved lawsuits brought by the u.s. department of justice, 18 states, and the district of columbia in two separate actions. the final judgments imposed various constraints on our windows operating system businesses. the final judgments expired in may 2011.  in other ongoing investigations, various foreign governments and several state attorneys general have requested information from us concerning competition, privacy, and security issues.    73 



 table of contents     part ii  item 8      antitrust, unfair competition, and overcharge class actions  a large number of antitrust and unfair competition class action lawsuits were filed against us in various state, federal, and canadian courts on behalf of various classes of direct and indirect purchasers of our pc operating system and certain other software products. we obtained dismissals of damages claims of indirect purchasers under federal law and in 15 states. courts refused to certify classes in two additional states. we have reached agreements to settle all claims that have been made to date in 19 states and the district of columbia.  the settlements in all states have received final court approval. under the settlements, generally class members can obtain vouchers that entitle them to be reimbursed for purchases of a wide variety of platform-neutral computer hardware and software. the total value of vouchers that we may issue varies by state. we will make available to certain schools a percentage of those vouchers that are not issued or claimed (one-half to two-thirds depending on the state). the total value of vouchers we ultimately issue will depend on the number of class members who make claims and are issued vouchers. the maximum value of vouchers to be issued is approximately $2.7 billion. the actual costs of these settlements will be less than that maximum amount, depending on the number of class members and schools that are issued and redeem vouchers. we estimate the total cost to resolve all of the state overcharge class action cases will range between $1.9 billion and $2.0 billion. at june 30, 2011, we have recorded a liability related to these claims of approximately $568 million, which reflects our estimated exposure of $1.9 billion less payments made to date of approximately $1.3 billion mostly for vouchers, legal fees, and administrative expenses.  the three cases pending in british columbia, ontario, and quebec, canada have not been settled. in march 2010, the court in the british columbia case certified it as a class action. on april 15, 2011, the british columbia court of appeal reversed the class certification ruling and dismissed the case, holding that indirect purchasers do not have a claim. the plaintiffs have sought review by the canadian supreme court. the other two actions have been stayed.  other antitrust litigation and claims  in november 2004, novell, inc. (novell) filed a complaint in u.s. district court for the district of utah (later transferred to federal court in maryland), asserting antitrust and unfair competition claims against us related to novells ownership of wordperfect and other productivity applications during the period between june 1994 and march 1996. in june 2005, the trial court granted our motion to dismiss four of six claims of the complaint. in march 2010 the trial court granted summary judgment in favor of microsoft as to all remaining claims. the court of appeals has reversed that ruling, and the case is scheduled for trial in utah in october 2011.  patent and intellectual property claims  in 2003, we filed an action in u.s. district court in california seeking a declaratory judgment that we do not infringe certain alcatel-lucent patents (although this action began before the merger of alcatel and lucent in 2006, for simplicity we refer to the post-merger entity of alcatel-lucent). in april 2008, a jury returned a verdict in alcatel-lucents favor in a trial on a consolidated group of one video and three user interface patents. the jury concluded that we had infringed two user interface patents and awarded $367 million in damages. in june 2008, the trial judge increased the amount of damages to $512 million to include $145 million of interest. we appealed that award. in december 2008, we entered into a settlement agreement resolving all other litigation pending between microsoft and alcatel-lucent, leaving approximately $500 million remaining in dispute. in september 2009, the court of appeals affirmed the liability award but vacated the verdict and remanded the case to the trial court for a re-trial of the damages ruling, indicating the damages previously awarded were too high. trial on the remanded damages claim was held in july 2011.  in october 2003, uniloc usa inc. (uniloc), a subsidiary of a singapore-based company, filed a patent infringement suit in u.s. district court in rhode island, claiming that product activation technology supporting windows xp and certain other microsoft programs violated a uniloc patent. after we obtained a favorable summary judgment that we did not infringe any of the claims of this patent, the court of appeals vacated the trial court decision and remanded    74 



 table of contents     part ii  item 8       the case for trial. in april 2009, the jury returned a $388 million verdict against us, including a finding of willful infringement. in september 2009, the district court judge overturned the jury verdict, ruling that the evidence did not support the jurys findings either that microsoft infringed the patent or was willful. uniloc appealed, and in january 2011 the court of appeals reversed the district courts finding of non-infringement (thus reinstating the jury verdict of infringement) but affirmed the district courts ruling that microsoft was not willful and affirmed the district courts grant of a new trial on damages. unilocs petition for rehearing of the court of appeals decision as to damages was denied. a new trial on damages has been set for january 2012.  in march 2007, i4i limited partnership (i4i) sued microsoft in u.s. district court in texas claiming that certain custom xml technology in word 2003 and 2007 infringed i4is patent. in may 2009, a jury returned a verdict against us, finding damages of $200 million and that we willfully infringed the patent. in august 2009, the court denied our post-trial motions and awarded enhanced damages of $40 million and prejudgment interest of $37 million. the court also issued a permanent injunction prohibiting additional distribution of the allegedly infringing technology. we appealed and the appellate court stayed the injunction pending our appeal. in december 2009, the court of appeals rejected our appeal and affirmed the trial courts judgment and injunction, except that the court of appeals modified the effective date of the injunction to january 11, 2010. we appealed to the u.s. supreme court, and in june 2011 the court affirmed the judgment of the court of appeals.  in october 2010, we filed suit against motorola with the international trade commission (itc) and in u.s. district court in washington for infringement of nine microsoft patents by motorolas android-based devices. since then, microsoft and motorola have filed additional actions against each other in the itc and federal courts in washington, wisconsin, florida, and california. microsoft asserts motorolas android-based devices violate 23 of its patents, and motorola asserts various microsoft products (including windows, windows phone 7, windows mobile 6.5, xbox, bing maps, hotmail, messenger, and exchange server) violate 21 motorola patents. microsoft also claims motorola has breached its contractual commitments to the institute of electrical and electronics engineers (ieee) and international telecommunications union (itu) to license identified patents related to wireless and video coding technologies under reasonable and non-discriminatory (rand) terms and conditions. motorola asserts that microsoft breached contractual commitments to the sd card association to license two patents under rand terms and conditions, and asserts federal antitrust and state unfair business practice claims. trial in our itc case is set for august 2011, trial in motorolas itc case is set for october 2011, and trial of both parties patent infringement claims in florida also is set for october 2011.  in addition to these cases, there are approximately 55 other patent infringement cases pending against microsoft.  other  we also are subject to a variety of other claims and suits that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of our business. although management currently believes that resolving claims against us, individually or in aggregate, will not have a material adverse impact on our financial statements, these matters are subject to inherent uncertainties and managements view of these matters may change in the future.  as of june 30, 2011, we had accrued aggregate liabilities of $693 million in other current liabilities and $276 million in other long-term liabilities for all of the contingent matters described in this note. while we intend to vigorously defend these matters, there exists the possibility of adverse outcomes that we estimate could reach approximately $800 million in aggregate beyond recorded amounts. were unfavorable final outcomes to occur, there exists the possibility of a material adverse impact on our financial statements for the period in which the effects become reasonably estimable.    75
