## Item 1A


table of contents   part i   item 1a       alternative is particularly important and challenging due to the scale effects enjoyed by a single market dominant competitor. advances in computing and communications technologies have made this model viable and enabled the rapid growth of some of our competitors. we are devoting significant resources toward developing our own competing software plus services strategies including the windows azure platform, our hosted computing platform designed to facilitate the rapid, flexible and scalable development of cloud-based services. it is uncertain whether these strategies will be successful.  an important element of our business model has been to create platform-based ecosystems on which many participants can build diverse solutions. a competing vertically-integrated model, in which a single firm controls both the software and hardware elements of a product, has been successful with certain consumer products such as personal computers, mobile phones, and digital music players. we also offer vertically-integrated hardware and software products; however, efforts to compete with the vertically integrated model may increase our cost of sales and reduce our operating margins.  we face intense competition.    we continue to experience intense competition across all markets for our products and services. our competitors range in size from fortune 100 companies to small, specialized single-product businesses and open source community-based projects. although we believe the breadth of our businesses and product portfolio is a competitive advantage, our competitors that are focused on narrower product lines may be more effective in devoting technical, marketing, and financial resources to compete with us. in addition, barriers to entry in our businesses generally are low and products, once developed, can be distributed broadly and quickly at relatively low cost. open source software vendors are devoting considerable efforts to developing software that mimics the features and functionality of our products, in some cases on the basis of technical specifications for microsoft technologies that we make available at little or no cost. in response to competition, we are developing versions of our products with basic functionality that are sold at lower prices than the standard versions. these competitive pressures may result in decreased sales volumes, price reductions, and/or increased operating costs, such as for marketing and sales incentives, resulting in lower revenue, gross margins, and operating income.  we may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property rights.    protecting our global intellectual property rights and combating unlicensed copying and use of software and other intellectual property is difficult. while piracy adversely affects u.s. revenue, the impact on revenue from outside the u.s. is more significant, particularly in countries where laws are less protective of intellectual property rights. similarly, the absence of harmonized patent laws makes it more difficult to ensure consistent respect for patent rights. throughout the world, we actively educate consumers about the benefits of licensing genuine products and obtaining indemnification benefits for intellectual property risks, and we educate lawmakers about the advantages of a business climate where intellectual property rights are protected. however, continued educational and enforcement efforts may fail to enhance revenue. reductions in the legal protection for software intellectual property rights could adversely affect revenue.  third parties may claim we infringe their intellectual property rights.    from time to time we receive notices from others claiming we infringe their intellectual property rights. the number of these claims may grow. to resolve these claims we may enter into royalty and licensing agreements on less favorable terms, stop selling or redesign affected products, or pay damages to satisfy indemnification commitments with our customers. such agreements may cause operating margins to decline. we have made and expect to continue making significant expenditures to settle claims related to the use of technology and intellectual property rights as part of our strategy to manage this risk.  we may not be able to protect our source code from copying if there is an unauthorized disclosure of source code.    source code, the detailed program commands for our operating systems and other software programs, is critical to our business. although we license portions of our application and operating system source code to a number of licensees, we take significant measures to protect the secrecy of large portions of our source code. if an unauthorized disclosure of a significant portion of our source code occurs, we could potentially lose future trade secret protection for that source code. this could make it easier for third parties to compete with our products by copying functionality, which could adversely affect our revenue and operating margins. unauthorized disclosure of source code also could increase the security risks described in the next paragraph.   security vulnerabilities in our products could lead to reduced revenues or to liability claims.    maintaining the security of computers and computer networks is a critical issue for us and our customers. hackers develop and deploy viruses, worms, and other malicious software programs that attack our products. although this is an industry-wide problem that affects computers across all platforms, it affects our products in particular because hackers tend        



table of contents   part i   item 1a       to focus their efforts on the most popular operating systems and programs and we expect them to continue to do so. we devote significant resources to address security vulnerabilities through:              the cost of these steps could reduce our operating margins. despite these efforts, actual or perceived security vulnerabilities in our products could lead some customers to seek to return products, to reduce or delay future purchases, or to use competing products. customers may also increase their expenditures on protecting their existing computer systems from attack, which could delay adoption of new technologies. any of these actions by customers could adversely affect our revenue. in addition, actual or perceived vulnerabilities may lead to claims against us. although our license agreements typically contain provisions that eliminate or limit our exposure to such liability, there is no assurance these provisions will withstand all legal challenges.  we are subject to government litigation and regulatory activity that affects how we design and market our products.    as a leading global software maker, we receive close scrutiny from government agencies under u.s. and foreign competition laws. some jurisdictions also provide private rights of action for competitors or consumers to assert claims of anti-competitive conduct. for example, we have been involved in the following actions.  lawsuits brought by the u.s. department of justice, 18 states, and the district of columbia in two separate actions were resolved through a consent decree that took effect in 2001 and a final judgment entered in 2002. these proceedings imposed various constraints on our windows operating system businesses. these constraints include limits on certain contracting practices, mandated disclosure of certain software program interfaces and protocols, and rights for computer manufacturers to limit the visibility of certain windows features in new pcs. we believe we are in full compliance with these rules. however, if we fail to comply with them, additional restrictions could be imposed on us that would adversely affect our business.  the european commission closely scrutinizes the design of high-volume microsoft products and the terms on which we make certain technologies used in these products, such as file formats, programming interfaces, and protocols, available to other companies. in 2004, the commission ordered us to create new versions of windows that do not include certain multimedia technologies and to provide our competitors with specifications for how to implement certain proprietary windows communications protocols in their own products. the commissions impact on product design may limit our ability to innovate in windows or other products in the future, diminish the developer appeal of the windows platform, and increase our product development costs. the availability of licenses related to protocols and file formats may enable competitors to develop software products that better mimic the functionality of our own products which could result in decreased sales of our products.  government regulatory actions and court decisions such as these may hinder our ability to provide the benefits of our software to consumers and businesses, thereby reducing the attractiveness of our products and the revenues that come from them. new actions could be initiated at any time, either by these or other governments or private claimants, including with respect to new versions of windows or other microsoft products. the outcome of such actions, or steps taken to avoid them, could adversely affect us in a variety of ways, including:               



table of contents   part i   item 1a      our software and services online offerings are subject to government regulation of the internet domestically and internationally in many areas, including user privacy, telecommunications, data protection, and online content. the application of these laws and regulations to our business is often unclear and sometimes may conflict. compliance with these regulations may involve significant costs or require changes in business practices that result in reduced revenue. noncompliance could result in penalties being imposed on us or orders that we stop doing the alleged noncompliant activity.  our business depends on our ability to attract and retain talented employees.    our business is based on successfully attracting and retaining talented employees. the market for highly skilled workers and leaders in our industry is extremely competitive. we are limited in our ability to recruit internationally by restrictive domestic immigration laws. if we are less successful in our recruiting efforts, or if we are unable to retain key employees, our ability to develop and deliver successful products and services may be adversely affected. effective succession planning is also important to our long-term success. failure to ensure effective transfer of knowledge and smooth transitions involving key employees could hinder our strategic planning and execution.  delays in product development schedules may adversely affect our revenues.    the development of software products is a complex and time-consuming process. new products and enhancements to existing products can require long development and testing periods. our increasing focus on software plus services also presents new and complex development issues. significant delays in new product or service releases or significant problems in creating new products or services could adversely affect our revenue.  we make significant investments in new products and services that may not be profitable.    our growth depends on our ability to innovate by offering new, and adding value to our existing, software and service offerings. we will continue to make significant investments in research, development, and marketing for new products, services, and technologies, including the windows pc operating system, the microsoft office system, xbox 360, live search, windows server, zune, windows live, the windows azure services platform, and other software plus services offerings. investments in new technology are speculative. commercial success depends on many factors, including innovativeness, developer support, and effective distribution and marketing. if customers do not perceive our latest offerings as providing significant new functionality or other value, they may reduce their purchases of new software products or upgrades, unfavorably impacting revenue. we may not achieve significant revenue from new product and service investments for a number of years, if at all. moreover, new products and services may not be profitable, and even if they are profitable, operating margins for new products and businesses may not be as high as the margins we have experienced historically.  adverse economic conditions may harm our business.    unfavorable changes in economic conditions, including inflation, recession, or other changes in economic conditions, may result in lower information technology spending and adversely affect our revenue. if demand for pcs, servers, and other computing devices declines, or consumer or business spending for those products declines, our revenue will be adversely affected. our product distribution system also relies on an extensive partner network. the impact of economic conditions on our partners, such as the bankruptcy of a major distributor, could result in sales channel disruption. challenging economic conditions also may impair the ability of our customers to pay for products and services they have purchased. as a result, reserves for doubtful accounts and write-offs of accounts receivable may increase. we maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings, types, and maturities. these investments are subject to general credit, liquidity, market, and interest rate risks, which may be exacerbated by unusual events that have affected global financial markets. if global credit and equity markets experience prolonged periods of decline, our investment portfolio may be adversely impacted and we could determine that more of our investments have experienced an other-than-temporary decline in fair value, requiring impairment charges that could adversely impact our financial results.  we have claims and lawsuits against us that may result in adverse outcomes.    we are subject to a variety of claims and lawsuits. adverse outcomes in some or all of these claims may result in significant monetary damages or injunctive relief that could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business. although management currently believes resolving all of these matters, individually or in the aggregate, will not have a material adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows, the litigation and other claims are subject to inherent uncertainties and managements view of these matters may change in the future. a material adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows also could occur for the period in which the effect of an unfavorable final outcome becomes probable and reasonably estimable.       



table of contents   part i   item 1a      we may have additional tax liabilities.    we are subject to income taxes in the united states and many foreign jurisdictions. significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes. in the ordinary course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. we regularly are under audit by tax authorities. although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals. the results of an audit or litigation could have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows in the period or periods for which that determination is made. in addition, there have been proposals to reform u.s. tax laws that would significantly impact how u.s. multinational corporations are taxed on foreign earnings. we earn a substantial portion of our income in foreign countries. although we cannot predict whether or in what form this proposed legislation will pass, if enacted it could have a material adverse impact on our tax expense and cash flow.  our vertically-integrated hardware and software products may experience quality or supply problems.    our hardware products such as the xbox 360 console are highly complex and can have defects in design, manufacture, or associated software. we could incur significant expenses, lost revenue, and reputational harm if we fail to detect or effectively address such issues through design, testing, or warranty repairs. we obtain some components of our hardware devices from sole suppliers. if a component delivery from a sole-source supplier is delayed or becomes unavailable or industry shortages occur, we may be unable to obtain timely replacement supplies, resulting in reduced sales. either component shortages or excess or obsolete inventory may require us to record charges to cost of revenue. xbox 360 consoles are assembled in asia; disruptions in the supply chain may result in console shortages that would affect our revenues and operating margins. these same risks would apply to any other vertically-integrated hardware and software products we may offer.  if our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets become impaired we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings.    under generally accepted accounting principles, we review our amortizable intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually. factors that may be considered a change in circumstances, indicating that the carrying value of our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets may not be recoverable, include a decline in stock price and market capitalization, reduced future cash flow estimates, and slower growth rates in our industry. we may be required to record a significant charge in our financial statements during the period in which any impairment of our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets is determined, negatively impacting our results of operations.  we operate a global business that exposes us to additional risks.    we operate in over 100 countries and a significant part of our revenue comes from international sales. pressure to make our pricing structure uniform might require that we reduce the sales price of our software in the united states and other countries. operations outside the united states may be affected by changes in trade protection laws, policies and measures, and other regulatory requirements affecting trade and investment, including the foreign corrupt practices act and local laws prohibiting corrupt payments; and changes in regulatory requirements for software. emerging markets are a significant focus of our international growth strategy. the developing nature of these markets presents a number of risks. deterioration of social, political, labor, or economic conditions in a specific country or region and difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations may also adversely affect our operations or financial results. although we hedge a portion of our international currency exposure, significant fluctuations in exchange rates between the u.s. dollar and foreign currencies may adversely affect our net revenues.  catastrophic events or geo-political conditions may disrupt our business.    a disruption or failure of our systems or operations in the event of a major earthquake, weather event, cyber-attack, terrorist attack, or other catastrophic event could cause delays in completing sales, providing services, or performing other mission-critical functions. our corporate headquarters, a significant portion of our research and development activities, and certain other critical business operations are located in the seattle, washington area, and we have other business operations in the silicon valley area of california, both of which are near major earthquake faults. a catastrophic event that results in the destruction or disruption of any of our critical business or information technology systems could harm our ability to conduct normal business operations and our operating results. abrupt political change, terrorist activity, and armed conflict pose a risk of general economic disruption in affected countries, which may increase our operating costs. these conditions also may add uncertainty to the timing and budget for technology investment decisions by our customers.

table of contents   part ii   item 7      fiscal year 2009 compared with fiscal year 2008  general and administrative expenses decreased primarily reflecting decreased costs for legal settlements and legal contingencies. we incurred legal charges of $283 million in current year, as compared with $1.8 billion during fiscal year 2008. the fiscal year 2008 legal costs were primarily related to the european commission fine of $1.4 billion (899 million).  fiscal year 2008 compared with fiscal year 2007  general and administrative expenses increased reflecting increased costs for legal settlements and legal contingencies, increased consulting and professional fees, and increased headcount-related expenses. we incurred $1.8 billion of legal charges during fiscal year 2008, primarily related to the european commission fine, as compared with $511 million of legal charges during fiscal year 2007. headcount-related expenses increased 7%, reflecting an increase in headcount from the prior year-end.  employee severance  in january 2009, we announced and implemented a resource management program to reduce discretionary operating expenses, employee headcount, and capital expenditures. as part of this program, we announced the elimination of up to 5,000 positions in research and development, marketing, sales, finance, legal, human resources, and information technology by june 30, 2010. during the current year, we recorded employee severance charges of $330 million for the expected reduction in employee headcount.  other income (expense)  the components of other income (expense) were as follows:    effective july 1, 2008, we began presenting gains and losses resulting from foreign currency remeasurements as a component of other income (expense). prior to july 1, 2008, we included gains and losses resulting from foreign currency remeasurements as a component of sales and marketing expense. we changed our presentation because this better reflects how we manage these foreign currency exposures, as such gains and losses arising from the remeasurement of foreign currency transactions are incidental to our operations. for the twelve months ended june 30, 2009, $509 million of losses were reported as other income (expense). for the twelve months ended june 30, 2008 and 2007, $221 million and $86 million of gains, respectively, were previously recorded as a component of sales and marketing expense and have been recast as other income (expense).  investments are considered to be impaired when a decline in fair value is judged to be other-than-temporary. we employ a systematic methodology that considers available evidence in evaluating potential impairment of our investments, including market declines subsequent to the period end. if the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value, among other factors, we evaluate general market conditions, credit quality of debt instrument issuers, the duration and extent to which the fair value is less than cost, and for equity securities, our intent and ability to hold, or plans to sell, the investment. for fixed income securities, we also evaluate whether we have plans to sell the security or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery. we also consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of and business outlook for the investee, including industry and          



table of contents   part ii   item 7       sector performance, changes in technology, and operational and financing cash flow factors. once a decline in fair value is determined to be other-than-temporary, an impairment charge is recorded to other income (expense) and a new cost basis in the investment is established.  we lend certain fixed-income and equity securities to increase investment returns. the loaned securities continue to be carried as investments on our balance sheet. collateral and/or security interest is determined based upon the underlying security and the creditworthiness of the borrower. cash collateral is recorded as an asset with a corresponding liability.  we use derivative instruments to manage risks related to foreign currencies, equity prices, interest rates, and credit; to enhance investment returns; and to facilitate portfolio diversification. gains and losses from changes in fair values of derivatives that are not designated as hedges are recognized in other income (expense). these are generally offset by unrealized gains and losses in the underlying securities in the investment portfolio and are recorded as a component of other comprehensive income.  fiscal year 2009 compared with fiscal year 2008  dividends and interest income decreased primarily reflecting lower interest rates on our fixed-income investments. net recognized losses on investments increased primarily due to higher other-than-temporary impairments that were partially offset by gains on sales of certain equity investments held in our strategic investments portfolio. other-than-temporary impairments were $862 million during the twelve months ended june 30, 2009, as compared with $312 million during the twelve months ended june 30, 2008 and increased primarily due to declines in equity values as a result of deterioration in equity markets. net losses on derivatives increased primarily due to losses on equity, commodity, and interest rate derivatives in the current period as compared with gains in the prior period. net losses on foreign currency remeasurements increased due to the strengthening of the u.s. dollar, particularly in the first half of the current fiscal year.  fiscal year 2008 compared with fiscal year 2007  dividends and interest income decreased reflecting lower interest rates on our fixed-income investments and a reduction in the average balance of interest-bearing investments owned. net recognized gains on investments, which include other-than-temporary impairments of $312 million during fiscal year 2008 and $25 million during fiscal year 2007, decreased primarily due to declines in equity values as a result of the recent stock market decline. net gains on derivatives increased primarily due to higher net gains on equity, commodity, and interest rate derivatives.  income taxes  fiscal year 2009 compared with fiscal year 2008  our effective tax rates in fiscal years 2009 and 2008 were 27% and 26%, respectively. while the fiscal year 2009 rate reflects a higher mix of foreign earnings taxed at lower rates, the rate increased from the prior year because the fiscal year 2008 rate reflects the resolution of tax positions relating to our agreement with the internal revenue service (irs) settling the 2000-2003 examination, partially offset by the european commission fine which was not tax deductible. as a result of the settlement and the impact on subsequent years, we paid the irs approximately $4.1 billion during fiscal year 2009.  fiscal year 2008 compared with fiscal year 2007  our effective tax rates in fiscal year 2008 and 2007 were 26% and 30%, respectively. the fiscal year 2008 rate was lower due to the items noted above.  financial condition  cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments totaled $31.4 billion as of june 30, 2009, compared with $23.7 billion as of june 30, 2008. equity and other investments were $4.9 billion as of june 30, 2009, compared with $6.6 billion as of june 30, 2008. our investments consist primarily of fixed-income securities, diversified among industries and individual issuers. our investments are generally liquid and investment grade. the portfolio is invested predominantly in u.s. dollar-denominated securities, but also includes foreign-denominated securities in order to diversify risk. we invest primarily in short-term securities to facilitate liquidity and for capital preservation. as a result of the special dividend paid in the second quarter of fiscal year 2005 and shares repurchased, our retained deficit, including accumulated other comprehensive income, was $22.8 billion at june 30, 2009. our retained deficit is not expected to affect our future ability to operate, pay dividends, or repay our debt given our continuing profitability and strong cash and financial position.       



table of contents   part ii   item 7      in general, and where applicable, we use quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities to determine fair value. this pricing methodology applies to our level 1 investments, such as exchange-traded mutual funds, domestic and international equities, u.s. treasuries, and agency securities. if quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities are not available to determine fair value, then we use quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities or inputs other than the quoted prices that are observable either directly or indirectly. this pricing methodology applies to our level 2 investments such as corporate notes and bonds, foreign government bonds, mortgage-backed securities, and certain agency securities. level 3 investments are valued using internally developed models with unobservable inputs. assets and liabilities measured using unobservable inputs are an immaterial portion of our portfolio.  a majority of our investments are priced by pricing vendors and are generally level 1 or level 2 investments as these vendors either provide a quoted market price in an active market or use observable inputs for their pricing without applying significant adjustments. broker pricing is used mainly when a quoted price is not available, the investment is not priced by our pricing vendors, or when a broker price is more reflective of fair values in the market in which the investment trades. our broker-priced investments are generally labeled as level 2 investments because the broker prices these investments based on similar assets without applying significant adjustments. in addition, all of our broker-priced investments have a sufficient level of trading volume to demonstrate that the fair values used are appropriate for these investments. our fair value processes include controls that are designed to ensure appropriate fair values are recorded. such controls include model validation, review of key model inputs, analysis of period-over-period fluctuations, and independent recalculation of prices where appropriate.  while we own certain mortgage- and asset-backed fixed-income securities, our portfolio as of june 30, 2009 does not contain direct exposure to subprime mortgages or structured vehicles that derive their value from subprime collateral. the majority of the mortgage-backed securities are collateralized by prime residential mortgages and carry a 100% principal and interest guarantee, primarily from federal national mortgage association, federal home loan mortgage corporation, and government national mortgage association. debt  short-term debt  in september 2008, our board of directors authorized debt financings of up to $6.0 billion. pursuant to the authorization, we established a commercial paper program providing for the issuance and sale of up to $2.0 billion in short-term commercial paper. as of june 30, 2009, $2.0 billion of the commercial paper was issued and outstanding with a weighted average interest rate, including issuance costs, of 0.20% and maturities of 22 to 119 days.  in september 2008, we also entered into a $2.0 billion six-month senior unsecured credit facility, principally to support the commercial paper program. in november 2008, we replaced the six-month credit facility with a $2.0 billion 364-day credit facility. this credit facility expires on november 6, 2009. in march 2009, we entered into an additional credit facility. this $1.0 billion 364-day credit facility expires on march 12, 2010. as of june 30, 2009, we were in compliance with the only financial covenant in both credit agreements, which requires us to maintain a coverage ratio of at least three times earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization to interest expense. no amounts were drawn against these credit facilities during the year ended june 30, 2009.  long-term debt  in november 2008, we filed a shelf registration statement with the u.s. securities and exchange commission that allows us to issue debt securities from time to time pursuant to the september 2008 authorization for debt financings of up to $6.0 billion. in may 2009, we issued $3.75 billion of debt securities under that registration statement as follows: $2.0 billion aggregate principal amount of 2.95% notes due 2014, $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of 4.20% notes due 2019, and $750 million aggregate principal amount of 5.20% notes due 2039 (collectively the notes). interest on the notes will be payable semi-annually on june 1 and december 1 of each year, commencing on december 1, 2009, to holders of record on the preceding may 15 and november 15. the notes are senior unsecured obligations and will rank equally with our other unsecured and unsubordinated debt outstanding.  we intend to use the net proceeds from sales of the debt securities for general corporate purposes, which may include funding for working capital, capital expenditures, repurchases of our capital stock, and acquisitions.

table of contents   part ii   item 7       year 2009. financing activities also included a $3.2 billion decrease in common stock repurchased, which was offset by a $2.9 billion decline in common stock issued. cash used for investing increased $11.2 billion due to a $15.9 billion rise in purchases of investments along with a $1.7 billion decrease in cash from investment sales and maturities. these impacts were partially offset by a $7.2 billion decrease in cash paid for acquisition of companies, including the purchase of aquantive in fiscal year 2008.  fiscal year 2008 compared with fiscal year 2007  cash flow from operations increased $3.8 billion due to an increase in cash received from customers driven by 18% revenue growth, partially offset by the $1.4 billion (899 million) payment of the european commission fine. cash used for financing decreased $11.6 billion primarily due to a $15.0 billion decrease in common stock repurchases, partially offset by a $3.3 billion decrease in cash proceeds from the issuance of common stock. cash used for investing was $4.6 billion for fiscal year 2008 as compared with cash provided of $6.1 billion for fiscal year 2007. this decrease was primarily due to a $6.9 billion increase in cash paid for acquisition of companies, reflecting the purchase of aquantive in the first quarter of fiscal year 2008, a $918 million increase in purchases of property and equipment, and a $3.1 billion decrease in cash from combined investment purchases, sales, and maturities.  stockholders equity at june 30, 2009, was $39.6 billion. we will continue to invest in sales, marketing, product support infrastructure, and existing and advanced areas of technology. additions to property and equipment will continue, including new facilities, data centers, and computer systems for research and development, sales and marketing, support, and administrative staff. commitments for constructing new buildings were $621 million on june 30, 2009. we have operating leases for most u.s. and international sales and support offices and certain equipment under which we incurred rental expense totaling $475 million, $398 million, and $325 million, in fiscal years 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively. we have not engaged in any related party transactions or arrangements with unconsolidated entities or other persons that are reasonably likely to materially affect liquidity or the availability of capital resources.  share repurchases  on september 22, 2008, we announced the completion of the two repurchase programs approved by our board of directors during the first quarter of fiscal year 2007 to buy back up to $40.0 billion of microsoft common stock. on september 22, 2008, we also announced that our board of directors approved a new share repurchase program authorizing up to $40.0 billion in share repurchases with an expiration date of september 30, 2013. we repurchased 318 million shares for $8.2 billion during the fiscal year ended june 30, 2009; 101 million shares were repurchased for $2.7 billion under the repurchase program approved by our board of directors during the first quarter of fiscal year 2007 and 217 million shares were repurchased for $5.5 billion under the repurchase program approved by our board of directors during the first quarter of fiscal year 2009. as of june 30, 2009, approximately $34.5 billion remained of the $40.0 billion approved repurchase amount. all repurchases were made using cash resources. the repurchase program may be suspended or discontinued at any time without notice.  dividends  during fiscal years 2009 and 2008, our board of directors declared the following dividends:

table of contents   part ii   item 7      we believe existing cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments, together with funds generated from operations, should be sufficient to meet operating requirements, regular quarterly dividends, debt repayment schedules, and share repurchases. our philosophy regarding the maintenance of a balance sheet with a large component of cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, and equity and other investments, reflects our views on potential future capital requirements relating to research and development, creation and expansion of sales distribution channels, investments and acquisitions, share dilution management, legal risks, and challenges to our business model. we regularly assess our investment management approach in view of our current and potential future needs.  off-balance sheet arrangements  we provide indemnifications of varying scope and size to certain customers against claims of intellectual property infringement made by third parties arising from the use of our products and certain other matters. we evaluate estimated losses for these indemnifications under sfas no. 5, accounting for contingencies, as interpreted by financial accounting standards board interpretation (fin) no. 45, guarantors accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees, including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others. we consider such factors as the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss. to date, we have not encountered significant costs as a result of these obligations and have not accrued any liabilities related to these indemnifications in our financial statements.  contractual obligations  the following table summarizes our outstanding contractual obligations as of june 30, 2009. we expect to fund these commitments with existing cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and cash flows from operations.           



table of contents   part ii   item 7      recently issued accounting standards  recently adopted accounting pronouncements  on april 1, 2009, we adopted the financial accounting standards board (fasb) staff positions (fsp) fas 157-4, fsp fas 115-2 and fas 124-2, and fsp fas 107-1 and apb 28-1. these fsps are intended to provide additional application guidance and enhance disclosures about fair value measurements and impairments of securities. fsp fas 157-4 clarifies the objective and method of fair value measurement even when there has been a significant decrease in market activity for the asset being measured. fsp fas 115-2 and fas 124-2 establishes a new model for measuring other-than-temporary impairments for debt securities, including establishing criteria for when to recognize a write-down through earnings versus other comprehensive income. fsp fas 107-1 and apb 28-1 expands the fair value disclosures required for all financial instruments within the scope of sfas no. 107, disclosures about fair value of financial instruments, to interim periods. adoption of these fsps did not have a significant impact on our accounting for financial instruments but did expand our associated disclosures.  on january 1, 2009, we adopted sfas no. 161, disclosures about derivative instruments and hedging activities, an amendment of fasb statement no. 133. sfas no. 161 requires additional disclosures about the companys objectives in using derivative instruments and hedging activities, the method of accounting for such instruments under sfas no. 133, accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities, and its related interpretations, and tabular disclosures of the effects of such instruments and related hedged items on our financial position, financial performance, and cash flows. see note 5  derivatives of the notes to financial statements (part ii, item 8).  on july 1, 2008, we adopted sfas no. 157, fair value measurements, for all financial assets and liabilities and nonfinancial assets and liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis (at least annually). sfas no. 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. this statement does not require any new fair value measurements, but provides guidance on how to measure fair value by providing a fair value hierarchy used to classify the source of the information. see note 4  investments of the notes to financial statements (part ii, item 8).  sfas no. 159, the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities-including an amendment of fasb statement no. 115, became effective for us on july 1, 2008. sfas no. 159 gives us the irrevocable option to elect fair value for the initial and subsequent measurement for certain financial assets and liabilities on a contract-by-contract basis with the difference between the carrying value before election of the fair value option and the fair value recorded upon election as an adjustment to beginning retained deficit. as of june 30, 2009, we had not elected the fair value option for any eligible financial asset or liability.  recent accounting pronouncements not yet adopted  in june 2009, the fasb issued sfas no. 167, amendments to fasb interpretation no. 46(r), which is effective for us beginning july 1, 2010. this statement amends fin 46(r), consolidation of variable interest entities an interpretation of arb no. 51, to require revised evaluations of whether entities represent variable interest entities, ongoing assessments of control over such entities, and additional disclosures for variable interests. we believe the adoption of this pronouncement will not have a material impact on our financial statements.  in february 2008, the fasb issued fsp fas 157-2, effective date of fasb statement no. 157, which delays the effective date of sfas no. 157 for us to july 1, 2009, for all nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities, except for items that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis (at least annually). we believe the adoption of the delayed items of sfas no. 157 will not have a material impact on our financial statements.  in december 2007, the fasb issued sfas no. 141(r), business combinations, which replaces sfas no. 141. the statement retains the fundamental requirements in sfas no. 141 that the acquisition method of accounting (previously referred to as the purchase method of accounting) be used for all business combinations, but requires a number of changes, including changes in the way assets and liabilities are recognized as a result of business combinations. it also requires the capitalization of in-process research and development at fair value and requires the expensing of acquisition-related costs as incurred. in april 2009, the fasb issued fsp fas 141(r)-1 which amends sfas no. 141(r) by establishing a model to account for certain pre-acquisition contingencies. under the fsp, an          



table of contents   part ii   item 7       acquirer is required to recognize at fair value an asset acquired or a liability assumed in a business combination that arises from a contingency if the acquisition-date fair value of that asset or liability can be determined during the measurement period. if the acquisition-date fair value cannot be determined, then the acquirer should follow the recognition criteria in sfas no. 5, accounting for contingencies, and fasb interpretation no. 14, reasonable estimation of the amount of a loss  an interpretation of fasb statement no. 5. sfas no. 141(r) and fsp fas 141(r)-1 are effective for us beginning july 1, 2009, and will apply prospectively to business combinations completed on or after that date. the impact of the adoption of sfas no. 141(r) and fsp fas 141(r)-1 will depend on the nature of acquisitions completed after the date of adoption.  in december 2007, the fasb issued sfas no. 160, noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements  an amendment of arb no. 51, which changes the accounting and reporting for minority interests. minority interests will be recharacterized as noncontrolling interests and will be reported as a component of equity separate from the parents equity, and purchases or sales of equity interests that do not result in a change in control will be accounted for as equity transactions. in addition, net income attributable to the noncontrolling interest will be included in net income and, upon a loss of control, the interest sold, as well as any interest retained, will be recorded at fair value with any gain or loss recognized in net income. sfas no. 160 is effective for us beginning july 1, 2009, and will apply prospectively, except for the presentation and disclosure requirements, which will apply retrospectively. we believe the adoption of sfas no. 160 will not have a material impact on our financial statements.  application of critical accounting policies  our financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with u.s. gaap. preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. these estimates and assumptions are affected by managements application of accounting policies. critical accounting policies for us include revenue recognition, impairment of investment securities, impairment of goodwill, accounting for research and development costs, accounting for contingencies, accounting for income taxes, accounting for stock-based compensation, and accounting for product warranties.  revenue recognition  we account for the licensing of software in accordance with american institute of certified public accountants statement of position (sop) 97-2, software revenue recognition. the application of sop 97-2 requires judgment, including whether a software arrangement includes multiple elements, and if so, whether vendor-specific objective evidence (vsoe) of fair value exists for those elements.  a portion of the revenue related to windows xp is recorded as unearned due to undelivered elements including, in some cases, free post-delivery telephone support and the right to receive unspecified upgrades/enhancements of microsoft internet explorer on a when-and-if-available basis. the amount of revenue allocated to undelivered elements is based on the vsoe of fair value for those elements using the residual method or relative fair value method. unearned revenue due to undelivered elements is recognized ratably on a straight-line basis over the related products life cycles. revenue related to windows vista is not subject to a similar deferral because there are no significant undelivered elements. however, windows vista revenue is subject to deferral as a result of the windows 7 upgrade option program which started june 26, 2009. the program allows customers who purchase pcs from participating computer makers or retailers with certain versions of windows vista to receive an upgrade to the corresponding version of windows 7 at minimal or no cost. in addition, purchasers of retail packaged windows vista may also qualify for a free or discounted upgrade to the equivalent windows 7 product with participating retailers in participating markets when the product becomes generally available. accordingly, estimated revenue related to the undelivered windows 7 product is deferred until the product is delivered.  changes to the elements in a software arrangement, the ability to identify vsoe for those elements, the fair value of the respective elements, and changes to a products estimated life cycle could materially impact the amount of earned and unearned revenue. judgment is also required to assess whether future releases of certain software represent new products or upgrades and enhancements to existing products.  impairment of investment securities  sfas no. 115, accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities, staff accounting bulletin no. 111, and fsp fas 115-2 and fas 124-2, recognition and presentation of other-than-temporary impairments, provide guidance        



table of contents   part ii   item 7       on determining when an investment is other-than-temporarily impaired. investments are reviewed quarterly for indicators of other-than-temporary impairment. this determination requires significant judgment. in making this judgment, we employ a systematic methodology quarterly that considers available quantitative and qualitative evidence in evaluating potential impairment of our investments. if the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value, we evaluate, among other factors, general market conditions, credit quality of debt instrument issuers, the duration and extent to which the fair value is less than cost, and for equity securities, our intent and ability to hold, or plans to sell, the investment. for fixed income securities, we also evaluate whether we have plans to sell the security or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery. we also consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of and business outlook for the investee, including industry and sector performance, changes in technology, and operational and financing cash flow factors. once a decline in fair value is determined to be other than temporary, an impairment charge is recorded to other income (expense) and a new cost basis in the investment is established. if market, industry, and/or investee conditions deteriorate, we may incur future impairments.  goodwill  sfas no. 142, goodwill and other intangible assets, requires that goodwill be tested for impairment at the reporting unit level (operating segment or one level below an operating segment) on an annual basis and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. these events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate, legal factors, operating performance indicators, competition, or sale or disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit. application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment, including the identification of reporting units, assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units, assignment of goodwill to reporting units, and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit. the fair value of each reporting unit is estimated using a discounted cash flow methodology. this analysis requires significant judgments, including estimation of future cash flows, which is dependent on internal forecasts, estimation of the long-term rate of growth for our business, estimation of the useful life over which cash flows will occur, and determination of our weighted average cost of capital. changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and goodwill impairment for each reporting unit. we allocate goodwill to reporting units based on the reporting unit expected to benefit from the combination. we evaluate our reporting units on an annual basis and, if necessary, reassign goodwill using a relative fair value allocation approach.  during the second quarter of fiscal year 2009, we changed the date of our annual impairment test from july 1 to may 1. the change was made to more closely align the impairment testing date with our long-range planning and forecasting process. we believe the change in accounting principle related to changing our annual impairment testing date did not delay, accelerate, or avoid an impairment charge. we have determined that this change in accounting principle is preferable under the circumstances and does not result in adjustments to our financial statements when applied retrospectively. during fiscal year 2009, the annual impairment test was performed as of july 1, 2008 and was performed again as of may 1, 2009. research and development costs  we account for research and development costs in accordance with applicable accounting pronouncements, including sfas no. 2, accounting for research and development costs, and sfas no. 86, accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold, leased, or otherwise marketed. sfas no. 86 specifies that costs incurred internally in researching and developing a computer software product should be charged to expense until technological feasibility has been established for the product. once technological feasibility is established, all software costs should be capitalized until the product is available for general release to customers. judgment is required in determining when technological feasibility of a product is established. we have determined that technological feasibility for our software products is reached after all high-risk development issues have been resolved through coding and testing. generally, this occurs shortly before the products are released to manufacturing. the amortization of these costs is included in cost of revenue over the estimated life of the products.         



table of contents   part ii   item 7      legal and other contingencies  the outcomes of legal proceedings and claims brought against us are subject to significant uncertainty. sfas no. 5, accounting for contingencies, requires that an estimated loss from a loss contingency such as a legal proceeding or claim should be accrued by a charge to income if it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. disclosure of a contingency is required if there is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss has been incurred. in determining whether a loss should be accrued we evaluate, among other factors, the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss. changes in these factors could materially impact our results of operations, financial position, or our cash flows.  income taxes  sfas no. 109, accounting for income taxes, establishes financial accounting and reporting standards for the effect of income taxes. the objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entitys financial statements or tax returns. accruals for uncertain tax positions are provided for in accordance with the requirements of fin no. 48, accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  an interpretation of fasb statement no. 109. under fin no. 48, we may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position should be measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. fin no. 48 also provides guidance on derecognition of income tax assets and liabilities, classification of current and deferred income tax assets and liabilities, accounting for interest and penalties associated with tax positions, and income tax disclosures. judgment is required in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns. variations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could materially impact our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.  stock-based compensation  we account for stock-based compensation in accordance with sfas no. 123(r), share-based payment. under the fair value recognition provisions of this statement, stock-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period. determining the fair value of stock-based awards at the grant date requires judgment, including estimating expected dividends. in addition, judgment is also required in estimating the amount of stock-based awards that are expected to be forfeited. if actual results differ significantly from these estimates, stock-based compensation expense and our results of operations could be impacted.  product warranties  we account for product warranties in accordance with sfas no. 5, accounting for contingencies. we provide for the estimated costs of hardware and software warranties at the time the related revenue is recognized. for hardware warranty, we estimate the costs based on historical and projected product failure rates, historical and projected repair costs, and knowledge of specific product failures (if any). the specific hardware warranty terms and conditions vary depending upon the product sold and country in which we do business, but generally include parts and labor over a period generally ranging from 90 days to three years. for software warranty, we estimate the costs to provide bug fixes, such as security patches, over the life of the software. we regularly reevaluate our estimates to assess the adequacy of the recorded warranty liabilities and adjust the amounts as necessary.       



table of contents   part ii   item 7      statement of managements responsibility for financial statements  management is responsible for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements and related information that are presented in this report. the consolidated financial statements, which include amounts based on managements estimates and judgments, have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america.  the company designs and maintains accounting and internal control systems to provide reasonable assurance at reasonable cost that assets are safeguarded against loss from unauthorized use or disposition, and that the financial records are reliable for preparing financial statements and maintaining accountability for assets. these systems are augmented by written policies, an organizational structure providing division of responsibilities, careful selection and training of qualified personnel, and a program of internal audits.  the company engaged deloitte & touche llp, an independent registered public accounting firm, to audit and render an opinion on the consolidated financial statements and internal control over financial reporting in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board (united states).  the board of directors, through its audit committee, consisting solely of independent directors of the company, meets periodically with management, internal auditors, and our independent registered public accounting firm to ensure that each is meeting its responsibilities and to discuss matters concerning internal controls and financial reporting. deloitte & touche llp and the internal auditors each have full and free access to the audit committee.

table of contents   part ii   item 7a       item 7a.    quantative and qualitative disclosures about market risk  risks  we are exposed to economic risk from foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, credit risk, equity prices, and commodity prices. a portion of these risks is hedged, but they may impact results of operations cash flows and financial condition.  foreign currency.    certain forecasted transactions, assets, and liabilities are exposed to foreign currency risk. we monitor our foreign currency exposures daily and use hedges where practicable to offset the risks and maximize the economic effectiveness of our foreign currency positions. principal currencies hedged include the euro, japanese yen, british pound, and canadian dollar.  interest rate.    our fixed-income portfolio is diversified across credit sectors and maturities, consisting primarily of investment-grade securities. the credit risk and average maturity of the fixed-income portfolio is managed to achieve economic returns that correlate to certain global and domestic fixed-income indices. in addition, we use to be announced forward purchase commitments of mortgage-backed assets to gain exposure to agency and mortgage-backed securities.  equity.    our equity portfolio consists of global, developed, and emerging market securities that are subject to market price risk. we manage the securities relative to certain global and domestic indices and expect their economic risk and return to correlate with these indices.  commodity.    we use broad-based commodity exposures to enhance portfolio returns and facilitate portfolio diversification. our investment portfolio has exposure to a variety of commodities, including precious metals, energy, and grain. we manage these exposures relative to global commodity indices and expect their economic risk and return to correlate with these indices.  value-at-risk  we use a value-at-risk (var) model to estimate and quantify our market risks. var is the expected loss, for a given confidence level, in fair value of our portfolio due to adverse market movements over a defined time horizon. the var model is not intended to represent actual losses in fair value, including determinations of other-than-temporary losses in fair value in accordance with u.s. gaap, but is used as a risk estimation and management tool. the distribution of the potential changes in total market value of all holdings is computed based on the historical volatilities and correlations among foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, equity prices, and commodity prices, assuming normal market conditions.  the var is calculated as the total loss that will not be exceeded at the 97.5 percentile confidence level or, alternatively stated, the losses could exceed the var in 25 out of 1,000 cases. several risk factors are not captured in the model, including liquidity risk, operational risk, and legal risk.  the following table sets forth the one-day var for substantially all of our positions as of june 30, 2009 and 2008 and for the year ended june 30, 2009:    total one-day var for the combined risk categories was $211 million at june 30, 2009 and $123 million at june 30, 2008. the total var is 25% less at june 30, 2009, and 34% less at june 30, 2008, than the sum of the separate risk categories in the above table due to the diversification benefit of the overall portfolio.

table of contents   part ii   item 8       notes to financial statements  note 1    accounting policies  accounting principles  the financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america.  principles of consolidation  the financial statements include the accounts of microsoft corporation and its subsidiaries. intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated. equity investments in which we exercise significant influence but do not control and are not the primary beneficiary are accounted for using the equity method. investments in which we are not able to exercise significant influence over the investee and which do not have readily determinable fair values are accounted for under the cost method.  estimates and assumptions  preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. examples include estimates of loss contingencies, product warranties, product life cycles, product returns, and stock-based compensation forfeiture rates; assumptions such as the elements comprising a software arrangement, including the distinction between upgrades/enhancements and new products; when technological feasibility is achieved for our products; the potential outcome of future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns; estimating the fair value and/or goodwill impairment for our reporting units; and determining when investment impairments are other-than-temporary. actual results and outcomes may differ from managements estimates and assumptions.  foreign currencies  assets and liabilities recorded in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rate on the balance sheet date. revenue and expenses are translated at average rates of exchange prevailing during the year. translation adjustments resulting from this process are recorded to other comprehensive income (oci).  effective july 1, 2008, we began presenting gains and losses resulting from foreign currency remeasurements as a component of other income (expense). prior to july 1, 2008, we included gains and losses resulting from foreign currency remeasurements as a component of sales and marketing expense. we changed our presentation because this better reflects how we manage these foreign currency exposures, as such gains and losses arising from the remeasurement of foreign currency transactions are incidental to our operations. prior period amounts have been recast to conform to the current period presentation. see note 3  other income (expense).  revenue recognition  revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the fee is fixed or determinable, and collectibility is probable. we enter into certain arrangements where we are obligated to deliver multiple products and/or services (multiple elements). in these arrangements, we generally allocate the total revenue among the elements based on the sales price of each element when sold separately (vendor-specific objective evidence).  revenue for retail packaged products, products licensed to original equipment manufacturers (oems), and perpetual licenses for current products under our open and select volume licensing programs generally is recognized as products are shipped. a portion of the revenue related to windows xp is recorded as unearned due to undelivered elements including, in some cases, free post-delivery telephone support and the right to receive unspecified upgrades/enhancements of microsoft internet explorer on a when-and-if-available basis. the amount of revenue allocated to undelivered elements is based on the vendor-specific objective evidence of fair value for those elements using the residual method or relative fair value method. unearned revenue due to undelivered elements is recognized          



table of contents   part ii   item 8       ratably on a straight-line basis over the related products life cycles. revenue related to windows vista is not subject to a similar deferral because there are no significant undelivered elements. however, windows vista revenue is subject to deferral as a result of the windows 7 upgrade option program which started june 26, 2009. the program allows customers who purchase pcs from participating computer makers or retailers with certain versions of windows vista to receive an upgrade to the corresponding version of windows 7 at minimal or no cost. in addition, purchasers of retail packaged windows vista may also qualify for a free or discounted upgrade to the equivalent windows 7 product with participating retailers in participating markets when the product becomes generally available. accordingly, estimated revenue related to the undelivered windows 7 product is deferred until the product is delivered.  revenue from multi-year licensing arrangements are accounted for as subscriptions, with billings recorded as unearned revenue and recognized as revenue ratably over the billing coverage period. certain multi-year licensing arrangements include rights to receive future versions of software product on a when-and-if-available basis under open and select volume licensing programs (software assurance). in addition, other multi-year licensing arrangements include a perpetual license for current products combined with rights to receive future versions of software products on a when-and-if-available basis under open, select, and enterprise agreement volume licensing programs. premier support services agreements, msn internet access subscriptions, xbox live, and microsoft developer network subscriptions are also accounted for as subscriptions.  revenue related to our xbox 360 game console, games published by us, and other hardware components is generally recognized when ownership is transferred to the retailers. revenue related to games published by third parties for use on the xbox 360 platform is recognized when games are manufactured by the game publishers. display advertising revenue is recognized as advertisements are displayed. search advertising revenue is recognized when the ad appears in the search results or when the action necessary to earn the revenue has been completed. consulting services revenue is recognized as services are rendered, generally based on the negotiated hourly rate in the consulting arrangement and the number of hours worked during the period. consulting revenue for fixed-price services arrangements is recognized as services are provided.  revenue generally is recognized net of any taxes collected from customers and subsequently remitted to governmental authorities.  cost of revenue  cost of revenue includes manufacturing and distribution costs for products sold and programs licensed, operating costs related to product support service centers and product distribution centers, costs incurred to drive traffic to our website and/or acquire online advertising space (traffic acquisitions costs), costs incurred to support and maintain internet-based products and services, warranty costs, inventory valuation adjustments, costs associated with the delivery of consulting services, and the amortization of capitalized research and development costs associated with software products that have reached technological feasibility. capitalized research and development costs are amortized over the estimated lives of the products.  product warranty  we provide for the estimated costs of fulfilling our obligations under hardware and software warranties at the time the related revenue is recognized. for hardware warranties, we estimate the costs based on historical and projected product failure rates, historical and projected repair costs, and knowledge of specific product failures (if any). the specific hardware warranty terms and conditions vary depending upon the product sold and the country in which we do business, but generally include parts and labor over a period generally ranging from 90 days to three years. for software warranties, we estimate the costs to provide bug fixes, such as security patches, over the estimated life of the software.  research and development  research and development expenses include payroll, employee benefits, stock-based compensation, and other headcount-related expenses associated with product development. research and development expenses also include third-party development and programming costs, localization costs incurred to translate software for international markets, the amortization of purchased software code and services content, and in-process research and development. such costs related to software development are included in research and development expense until        



table of contents   part ii   item 8       the point that technological feasibility is reached, which for our software products, is generally shortly before the products are released to manufacturing. once technological feasibility is reached, such costs are capitalized and amortized to cost of revenue over the estimated lives of the products.  sales and marketing  sales and marketing expenses include payroll, employee benefits, stock-based compensation, and other headcount-related expenses associated with sales and marketing personnel, and the costs of advertising, promotions, tradeshows, seminars, and other programs. advertising costs are expensed as incurred. advertising expense was $1.4 billion, $1.2 billion, and $1.3 billion in fiscal years 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively.  employee severance  we record employee severance when a specific plan has been approved by management, the plan has been communicated to employees, and it is unlikely that significant changes will be made to the plan.  stock-based compensation  we account for stock-based compensation in accordance with sfas no. 123(r), share-based payment. under the fair value recognition provisions of this statement, stock-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the applicable vesting period of the stock award (generally four to five years) using the straight-line method.  income taxes  income tax expense includes u.s. and international income taxes, plus the provision for u.s. taxes on undistributed earnings of international subsidiaries not deemed to be permanently invested. certain income and expenses are not reported in tax returns and financial statements in the same year. the tax effect of such temporary differences is reported as deferred income taxes.  financial instruments  we consider all highly liquid interest-earning investments with a maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase to be cash equivalents. the fair value of these investments approximates their carrying value. in general, investments with original maturities of greater than three months and remaining maturities of less than one year are classified as short-term investments. investments with maturities beyond one year may be classified as short-term based on their highly liquid nature and because such marketable securities represent the investment of cash that is available for current operations. all cash equivalents and short-term investments are classified as available-for-sale and realized gains and losses are recorded using the specific identification method. changes in market value, excluding other-than-temporary impairments, are reflected in oci.  equity and other investments classified as long-term include both debt and equity instruments. debt and publicly-traded equity securities are classified as available-for-sale and realized gains and losses are recorded using the specific identification method. changes in market value, excluding other-than-temporary impairments, are reflected in oci. common and preferred stock and other investments that are restricted for more than one year or are not publicly traded are recorded at cost or using the equity method.  we lend certain fixed-income and equity securities to enhance investment income. the loaned securities continue to be carried as investments on our balance sheet. collateral and/or security interests received (securities pledged as collateral) are determined based upon the underlying security lent and the creditworthiness of the borrower. cash collateral is recorded as an asset with a corresponding liability.  investments are considered to be impaired when a decline in fair value is judged to be other-than-temporary. we employ a systematic methodology on a quarterly basis that considers available quantitative and qualitative evidence in evaluating potential impairment of our investments. if the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value, we evaluate, among other factors, general market conditions, credit quality of debt instrument issuers, the duration and extent to which the fair value is less than cost, and for equity securities, our intent and ability to hold, or plans to

table of contents   part ii   item 8       sell, the investment. for fixed income securities, we also evaluate whether we have plans to sell the security or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery. we also consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of and business outlook for the investee, including industry and sector performance, changes in technology, and operational and financing cash flow factors. once a decline in fair value is determined to be other-than-temporary, an impairment charge is recorded to other income (expense) and a new cost basis in the investment is established.  derivative instruments are recognized as either assets or liabilities and are measured at fair value. the accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation. see note 5  derivatives.  our current financial liabilities, including our short-term debt, have fair values that approximate their carrying values. our long-term financial liabilities consist of long-term debt which is recorded on the balance sheet at issuance price less unamortized discount.  allowance for doubtful accounts  the allowance for doubtful accounts reflects our best estimate of probable losses inherent in the accounts receivable balance. we determine the allowance based on known troubled accounts, historical experience, and other currently available evidence. activity in the allowance for doubtful accounts was as follows:    inventories  inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market, using the average cost method. cost includes materials, labor, and manufacturing overhead related to the purchase and production of inventories. we regularly review inventory quantities on hand, future purchase commitments with our suppliers, and the estimated utility of our inventory. if our review indicates a reduction in utility below carrying value, we reduce our inventory to a new cost basis through a charge to cost of revenue.  property and equipment  property and equipment is stated at cost and depreciated using the straight-line method over the shorter of the estimated life of the asset or the lease term, ranging from one to 15 years. computer software developed or obtained for internal use is depreciated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the software, generally three years.  goodwill   goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis and between annual tests if indicators of potential impairment exist, using a fair-value-based approach. during the second quarter of fiscal year 2009, we changed the date of our annual impairment test from july 1 to may 1. the change was made to more closely align the impairment testing date with our long-range planning and forecasting process. we believe the change in our annual impairment testing date did not delay, accelerate, or avoid an impairment charge. we have determined that this change in accounting principle is preferable under the circumstances and does not result in adjustments to our financial statements when applied retrospectively. see note 10  goodwill.       



table of contents   part ii   item 8      intangible assets  intangible assets are amortized using the straight-line method over their estimated period of benefit, ranging from one to 10 years. we evaluate the recoverability of intangible assets periodically by taking into account events or circumstances that may warrant revised estimates of useful lives or that may indicate the asset may be impaired. all of our intangible assets are subject to amortization. no material impairments of intangible assets have been identified during any of the periods presented.  subsequent events  we evaluated events occurring between the end of our most recent fiscal year and july 29, 2009, the date the financial statements were issued.  recently issued accounting standards  recently adopted accounting pronouncements  on april 1, 2009, we adopted the financial accounting standards board (fasb) staff positions (fsp) fas 157-4, fsp fas 115-2 and fas 124-2, and fsp fas 107-1 and apb 28-1. these fsps are intended to provide additional application guidance and enhance disclosures about fair value measurements and impairments of securities. fsp fas 157-4 clarifies the objective and method of fair value measurement even when there has been a significant decrease in market activity for the asset being measured. fsp fas 115-2 and fas 124-2 establishes a new model for measuring other-than-temporary impairments for debt securities, including establishing criteria for when to recognize a write-down through earnings versus other comprehensive income. fsp fas 107-1 and apb 28-1 expands the fair value disclosures required for all financial instruments within the scope of sfas no. 107, disclosures about fair value of financial instruments, to interim periods. adoption of these fsps did not have a significant impact on our accounting for financial instruments but did expand our associated disclosures.  on january 1, 2009, we adopted statement of financial accounting standards (sfas) no. 161, disclosures about derivative instruments and hedging activities, an amendment of fasb statement no. 133. sfas no. 161 requires additional disclosures about the companys objectives in using derivative instruments and hedging activities, the method of accounting for such instruments under sfas no. 133, accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities, and its related interpretations, and tabular disclosures of the effects of such instruments and related hedged items on our financial position, financial performance, and cash flows. see note 5  derivatives.  on july 1, 2008, we adopted sfas no. 157, fair value measurements, for all financial assets and liabilities and nonfinancial assets and liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis (at least annually). sfas no. 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. this statement does not require any new fair value measurements, but provides guidance on how to measure fair value by providing a fair value hierarchy used to classify the source of the information. see note 4  investments.  sfas no. 159, the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities-including an amendment of fasb statement no. 115, became effective for us on july 1, 2008. sfas no. 159 gives us the irrevocable option to elect fair value for the initial and subsequent measurement for certain financial assets and liabilities on a contract-by-contract basis with the difference between the carrying value before election of the fair value option and the fair value recorded upon election as an adjustment to beginning retained deficit. as of june 30, 2009, we had not elected the fair value option for any eligible financial asset or liability.  recent accounting pronouncements not yet adopted  in june 2009, the fasb issued sfas no. 167, amendments to fasb interpretation no. 46(r), which is effective for us beginning july 1, 2010. this statement amends financial accounting standards board interpretation (fin) no. 46(r), consolidation of variable interest entities an interpretation of arb no. 51, to require revised evaluations of whether entities represent variable interest entities, ongoing assessments of control over such entities, and additional disclosures for variable interests. we believe the adoption of this pronouncement will not have a material impact on our financial statements.  in february 2008, the fasb issued fsp fas 157-2, effective date of fasb statement no. 157, which delays the effective date of sfas no. 157 for us to july 1, 2009, for all nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities, except

table of contents   part ii   item 8       for items that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis (at least annually). we believe the adoption of the delayed items of sfas no. 157 will not have a material impact on our financial statements.  in december 2007, the fasb issued sfas no. 141(r), business combinations, which replaces sfas no. 141. the statement retains the fundamental requirements in sfas no. 141 that the acquisition method of accounting (previously referred to as the purchase method of accounting) be used for all business combinations, but requires a number of changes, including changes in the way assets and liabilities are recognized as a result of business combinations. it also requires the capitalization of in-process research and development at fair value and requires the expensing of acquisition-related costs as incurred. in april 2009, the fasb issued fsp fas 141(r)-1 which amends sfas no. 141(r) by establishing a model to account for certain pre-acquisition contingencies. under the fsp, an acquirer is required to recognize at fair value an asset acquired or a liability assumed in a business combination that arises from a contingency if the acquisition-date fair value of that asset or liability can be determined during the measurement period. if the acquisition-date fair value cannot be determined, then the acquirer should follow the recognition criteria in sfas no. 5, accounting for contingencies, and fasb interpretation no. 14, reasonable estimation of the amount of a loss  an interpretation of fasb statement no. 5. sfas no. 141(r) and fsp fas 141(r)-1 are effective for us beginning july 1, 2009, and will apply prospectively to business combinations completed on or after that date. the impact of the adoption of sfas no. 141(r) and fsp fas 141(r)-1 will depend on the nature of acquisitions completed after the date of adoption.  in december 2007, the fasb issued sfas no. 160, noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements  an amendment of arb no. 51, which changes the accounting and reporting for minority interests. minority interests will be recharacterized as noncontrolling interests and will be reported as a component of equity separate from the parents equity, and purchases or sales of equity interests that do not result in a change in control will be accounted for as equity transactions. in addition, net income attributable to the noncontrolling interest will be included in net income and, upon a loss of control, the interest sold, as well as any interest retained, will be recorded at fair value with any gain or loss recognized in net income. sfas no. 160 is effective for us beginning july 1, 2009, and will apply prospectively, except for the presentation and disclosure requirements, which will apply retrospectively. we believe the adoption of sfas no. 160 will not have a material impact on our financial statements.  note 2    earnings per share  basic earnings per share is computed on the basis of the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. diluted earnings per share is computed on the basis of the weighted average number of shares of common stock plus the effect of dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period using the treasury stock method. dilutive potential common shares include outstanding stock options, stock awards, and shared performance stock awards. the components of basic and diluted earnings per share are as follows:    for the years ended june 30, 2009, 2008, and 2007, 342 million, 91 million, and 199 million shares, respectively, were attributable to outstanding stock-based awards and were excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per share because their inclusion would have been anti-dilutive.

table of contents   part ii   item 8      at june 30, 2009, unrealized losses of $285 million consisted of: $79 million related to investment grade fixed-income securities, $24 million related to investments in high yield and emerging market fixed-income securities, $110 million related to domestic equity securities, and $72 million related to international equity securities. at june 30, 2008, unrealized losses of $255 million consisted of: $121 million related to investment grade fixed-income securities, $21 million related to investments in high yield and emerging market fixed-income securities, $99 million related to domestic equity securities, and $14 million related to international equity securities. unrealized losses from fixed-income securities are primarily attributable to changes in interest rates. unrealized losses from domestic and international equities are due to market price movements. management does not believe any unrealized losses represent other-than-temporary impairments based on our evaluation of available evidence as of june 30, 2009.  at june 30, 2009, the recorded basis and estimated fair value of common and preferred stock and other investments that are restricted for more than one year or are not publicly traded was $204 million. at june 30, 2008, the recorded basis and estimated fair value of these investments was $289 million. the estimate of fair value is based on publicly available market information or other estimates determined by management.  debt investment maturities    note 5    derivatives  we use derivative instruments to manage risks related to foreign currencies, equity prices, interest rates, and credit; to enhance investment returns; and to facilitate portfolio diversification. our objectives for holding derivatives include reducing, eliminating, and efficiently managing the economic impact of these exposures as effectively as possible. our derivative programs include strategies that both qualify and do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment under sfas no. 133, accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities.  foreign currency  certain forecasted transactions, assets, and liabilities are exposed to foreign currency risk. we monitor our foreign currency exposures daily to maximize the economic effectiveness of our foreign currency hedge positions. options and forward contracts are used to hedge a portion of forecasted international revenue for up to three years in the future and are designated as cash-flow hedging instruments. principal currencies hedged include the euro, japanese yen, british pound, and canadian dollar. as of june 30, 2009, the total notional amount of such foreign exchange contracts was $7.2 billion. foreign currency risks related to certain non-u.s. dollar denominated securities are hedged using foreign exchange forward contracts that are designated as fair-value hedging instruments. as of june 30, 2009, the total notional amount of these foreign exchange contracts sold was $3.5 billion. certain options and forwards not designated as hedging instruments are also used to manage the variability in exchange rates on accounts receivable, cash, and intercompany positions, and to manage other foreign currency exposures. as of june 30, 2009, the total notional amounts of these foreign exchange contracts purchased and sold were $3.2 billion and $3.6 billion, respectively.  equity  securities held in our equity and other investments portfolio are subject to market price risk. market price risk is managed relative to broad-based global and domestic equity indices using certain convertible preferred investments, options, futures, and swap contracts not designated as hedging instruments. from time to time, to hedge our price          



table of contents   part ii   item 8       risk, we may use and designate equity derivatives as hedging instruments, including puts, calls, swaps, and forwards. as of june 30, 2009, the total notional amounts of designated and non-designated equity contracts purchased and sold were immaterial.  interest rate  securities held in our fixed-income portfolio are subject to different interest rate risks based on their various maturities. the average maturity of the fixed-income portfolio is managed to achieve economic returns which correlate to certain broad-based fixed-income indices using exchange-traded option and futures contracts and over-the-counter swap and option contracts, none of which are designated as hedging instruments. as of june 30, 2009, the total notional amount of fixed-interest rate contracts purchased and sold were $2.7 billion and $456 million, respectively. in addition, we use to be announced forward purchase commitments of mortgage-backed assets to gain exposure to agency and mortgage-backed securities. these meet the definition of a derivative instrument under sfas no. 133 in cases where physical delivery of the assets is not taken at the earliest available delivery date. as of june 30, 2009, the total notional derivative amount of mortgage contracts purchased was $1.3 billion.  credit  our fixed-income portfolio is diversified and consists primarily of investment-grade securities. we use credit default swap contracts, not designated as hedging instruments, to manage credit exposures relative to broad-based indices and facilitate portfolio diversification. we use credit default swaps as they are a low cost way of managing exposure to individual credit risks or groups of credit risks while continuing to improve liquidity. as of june 30, 2009, the total notional amounts of credit contracts purchased and sold were immaterial.  commodity  we use broad-based commodity exposures to enhance portfolio returns and facilitate portfolio diversification. we use swap and futures contracts, not designated as hedging instruments, to generate and manage exposures to broad-based commodity indices. we use derivatives on commodities as they are low-cost alternatives to the purchase and storage of a variety of commodities, including, but not limited to, precious metals, energy, and grain. as of june 30, 2009, the total notional amounts of commodity contracts purchased and sold were $543 million and $33 million, respectively.  credit-risk-related contingent features  certain of our counterparty agreements for derivative instruments contain provisions that require our issued and outstanding long-term unsecured debt to maintain an investment grade credit rating and require us to maintain a minimum liquidity of $1.0 billion. to the extent we fail to meet these requirements, collateral will be required for posting, similar to the standard convention related to over-the-counter derivatives. as of june 30, 2009, our long-term unsecured debt rating was aaa, and cash investments were in excess of $1.0 billion. as a result, no collateral is required to be posted.

table of contents   part ii   item 8      cash-flow hedges  for a derivative instrument designated as a cash-flow hedge, the effective portion of the derivatives gain (loss) is initially reported as a component of other comprehensive income (oci) and is subsequently recognized in earnings when the hedged exposure is recognized in earnings. for options designated as cash-flow hedges, changes in the time value are excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and are recognized in earnings. gains (losses) on derivatives representing either hedge components excluded from the assessment of effectiveness or hedge ineffectiveness are recognized in earnings. during fiscal year 2009, we recognized the following gains (losses) related to foreign exchange contracts:    we estimate that $528 million of net derivative gains included in oci will be reclassified into earnings within the next 12 months. no significant amounts of gains (losses) were reclassified from oci into earnings as a result of forecasted transactions that failed to occur during fiscal year 2009.  non-designated derivatives  gains (losses) from changes in fair values of derivatives that are not designated as hedges are recognized in other income (expense). other than those derivatives entered into for investment purposes, such as commodity contracts, the gains (losses) below are generally economically offset by unrealized gains (losses) in the underlying securities and are recorded as a component of oci. the amounts recognized during fiscal year 2009 were as follows:    gains (losses) for foreign exchange, equity, interest rate, credit, and commodity contracts presented in other income statement line items were immaterial for fiscal year 2009 and have been excluded from the table above.  note 6    fair value measurements  sfas no. 157 defines fair value as the price that would be received upon sale of an asset or paid upon transfer of a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date and in the principal or most advantageous market for that asset or liability. the fair value should be calculated based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, not on assumptions specific to the entity. in addition, the fair value of liabilities should include consideration of non-performance risk, including our own credit risk.  in addition to defining fair value, sfas no. 157 expands the disclosure requirements around fair value and establishes a fair value hierarchy for valuation inputs. the hierarchy prioritizes the inputs into three levels based on the extent to which inputs used in measuring fair value are observable in the market. each fair value measurement is        



table of contents   part ii   item 8       reported in one of the three levels, which is determined by the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. these levels are:        the following section describes the valuation methodologies we use to measure financial assets and liabilities at fair value.  investments other than derivatives  investments other than derivatives primarily include u.s. government and agency securities, foreign government bonds, mortgage-backed securities, commercial paper, corporate notes and bonds, and common and preferred stock.  in general, and where applicable, we use quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities to determine fair value. this pricing methodology applies to our level 1 investments, such as domestic and international equities, u.s. treasuries, exchange-traded mutual funds, and agency securities. if quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities are not available to determine fair value, then we use quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities or inputs other than the quoted prices that are observable either directly or indirectly. these investments are included in level 2 and consist primarily of corporate notes and bonds, foreign government bonds, mortgage-backed securities, commercial paper, and certain agency securities. our level 3 assets primarily include investments in certain corporate bonds. we value the level 3 corporate bonds using internally developed valuation models, inputs to which include interest rate curves, credit spreads, stock prices, and volatilities. unobservable inputs used in these models are significant to the fair values of the investments. derivatives  in general, and where applicable, we use quoted prices in an active market for identical derivative assets and liabilities that are traded on exchanges. these derivative assets and liabilities are included in level 1. the fair values for the derivative assets and liabilities included in level 2 are estimated using industry standard valuation models, such as the black-scholes model. where applicable, these models project future cash flows and discount the future amounts to a present value using market-based observable inputs including interest rate curves, foreign exchange rates, and forward and spot prices for currencies and commodities. level 2 derivative assets and liabilities primarily include certain over-the-counter options, futures, and swap contracts. in certain cases, market-based observable inputs are not available and we use management judgment to develop assumptions to determine fair value. these derivative assets and liabilities are included in level 3 and primarily represent derivatives for foreign equities.

table of contents   part ii   item 8      assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis  we measure certain assets, including our cost and equity method investments, at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. these assets are recognized at fair value when they are deemed to be other-than-temporarily impaired. at june 30, 2009, the fair value of the common and preferred stock that we held that was required to be measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis was $164 million. this fair value was determined using models with significant unobservable inputs.  in accordance with the provisions of accounting principles board opinion no. 18, the equity method of accounting for investments in common stock, we review the carrying values of our investments when events and circumstances warrant, and we consider all available evidence in evaluating when declines in fair value are other than temporary. the fair values of our investments are determined based on valuation techniques using the best information available, and may include quoted market prices, market comparables, and discounted cash flow projections. an impairment charge is recorded when the cost of the investment exceeds its fair value and this condition is determined to be other than temporary. during the fiscal year ended june 30, 2009, impairment charges of $86 million were recognized for certain investments measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis as the decline in their respective fair values below their cost was determined to be other than temporary in all instances.  note 7    inventories  the components of inventories were as follows:    property and equipment are stated at cost. depreciation is computed principally on the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. the useful lives for buildings range from five to 15 years, leasehold improvements generally range from two to 10 years (representing the applicable lease terms plus reasonably assured extensions), computer equipment and software range from two to three years, and furniture and equipment range from one to five years. land is not depreciated.

table of contents   part ii   item 8      the components of the deferred income tax assets and liabilities were as follows:    deferred income tax balances reflect the effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases and are stated at enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when the taxes are actually paid or recovered.  we have not provided deferred u.s. income taxes or foreign withholding taxes on temporary differences of approximately $18.0 billion resulting from earnings for certain non-u.s. subsidiaries which are permanently reinvested outside the united states. the unrecognized deferred tax liability associated with these temporary differences is approximately $5.4 billion.  income taxes paid were $6.6 billion in fiscal year 2009, $5.4 billion in fiscal year 2008, and $5.2 billion in fiscal year 2007.  uncertain tax positions  as of june 30, 2009, we had $5.4 billion of unrecognized tax benefits of which $4.4 billion, if recognized, would affect our effective tax rate. as of june 30, 2008, we had $3.2 billion of unrecognized tax benefits of which $2.3 billion, if recognized, would affect our effective tax rate.  interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are included in income tax expense. such interest totaled $230 million in fiscal year 2009 and $121 million in fiscal year 2008. as of june 30, 2009 and 2008, we had accrued interest related to uncertain tax positions of $554 million and $324 million, respectively, net of federal income tax benefits, on our balance sheets.

table of contents   part ii   item 8      the aggregate changes in the balance of unrecognized tax benefits were as follows:    during fiscal year 2008, we reached a settlement with the internal revenue service (irs) on its 2000-2003 examination. as a result, we reduced our unrecognized tax benefits by $4.8 billion and recognized a tax provision reduction of $1.2 billion. as a result of the 2000-2003 settlement and the related impact on subsequent years, we paid the irs approximately $4.1 billion during fiscal year 2009.  we are under audit by the irs for the tax years 2004-2006. we do not believe it is reasonably possible that the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits will significantly increase or decrease within the next 12 months as we do not believe the examination will be concluded within the next 12 months.  we are subject to income tax in many jurisdictions outside the united states, none of which are individually material to our financial position, cash flows, or results of operations.  note 14    unearned revenue  unearned revenue is comprised of the following items:  volume licensing programs  represents customer billings for multi-year licensing arrangements, paid either upfront or annually at the beginning of each billing coverage period, which are accounted for as subscriptions with revenue recognized ratably over the billing coverage period.  undelivered elements  represents the right to receive unspecified upgrades/enhancements of microsoft internet explorer on a when-and-if-available basis and free post-delivery telephone support. this revenue deferral is applicable for windows xp and prior versions shipped as retail packaged products, products licensed to oems, and perpetual licenses for current products under our open and select volume licensing programs. the amount recorded as unearned is based on the sales price of those elements when sold separately and is recognized ratably on a straight-line basis over the related products life cycle. product life cycles are currently estimated at three and one-half years for windows operating systems. undelivered elements include $276 million of deferred revenue related to the windows 7 upgrade option program.  other  represents payments for post-delivery support and consulting services to be performed in the future, online advertising for which the advertisement has yet to be displayed, microsoft dynamics business solutions products, xbox live subscriptions, mediaroom, and other offerings for which we have been paid upfront and earn the revenue when we provide the service or software, or otherwise meet the revenue recognition criteria.

table of contents   part ii   item 8      we provide indemnifications of varying scope and size to certain customers against claims of intellectual property infringement made by third parties arising from the use of our products and certain other matters. we evaluate estimated losses for these indemnifications under sfas no. 5, accounting for contingencies, as interpreted by fin no. 45, guarantors accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees, including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others. we consider such factors as the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss. to date, we have not encountered significant costs as a result of these obligations and have not accrued any liabilities related to these indemnifications in our financial statements.  product warranty  the changes in our aggregate product warranty liabilities, which are included in other current liabilities and other long term-liabilities on our balance sheets, were as follows:    note 17    contingencies  government competition law matters  in march 2004, the european commission issued a competition law decision that, among other things, ordered us to license certain windows server protocol technology to our competitors. in march 2007, the european commission issued a statement of objections claiming that the pricing terms we proposed for licensing the technology as required by the march 2004 decision were not reasonable. following additional steps we took to address these concerns, the commission announced on october 22, 2007 that we were in compliance with the march 2004 decision and that no further penalty should accrue after that date. on february 27, 2008, the commission issued a fine of $1.4 billion (899 million) relating to the period prior to october 22, 2007. in may 2008, we filed an application with the european court of first instance to annul the february 2008 fine. we paid the $1.4 billion (899 million) fine in june 2008.  in january 2008, the commission opened a competition law investigation relating to the inclusion of various capabilities in our windows operating system software, including web browsing software. the investigation was precipitated by a complaint filed with the commission by opera software asa, a firm that offers web browsing software. on january 15, 2009, the european commission issued a statement of objections expressing the commissions preliminary view that the inclusion of internet explorer in windows since 1996 has violated european competition law. according to the statement of objections, other browsers are foreclosed from competing because windows includes internet explorer. we filed our written response to the statement of objections in late april 2009. the european commission will not make a final determination until after it assesses our response and considers submissions from others, a process that is now underway. the statement of objections seeks to impose a remedy that is different than the remedy imposed in the earlier proceeding concerning windows media player. while computer users and oems are already free to run any web browsing software on windows, the commission is considering ordering other changes to further promote the prospects of competing browser software. this may include ordering creation of a ballot screen from which computer users could choose from among a variety of browsers. the statement of objections also seeks to impose a significant fine based on worldwide sales of windows operating systems. in january 2008, the commission opened an additional competition law investigation that relates primarily to interoperability with respect to our microsoft office family of products. this investigation resulted from complaints filed with the commission by a trade association of microsofts competitors. on july 24, 2009 we submitted a proposal to the commission to resolve the investigation concerning internet explorer. under this proposal, european consumers who use internet explorer as their default browser would be shown a ballot screen from which they could, if they wished, easily install competing browsers from the web. we also submitted a proposal regarding means          



table of contents   part ii   item 8       of promoting greater interoperability between non-microsoft products and our windows and office families of products. we made this proposal following extensive discussions with the commission. in a statement issued on july 24, 2009, the commission stated it welcomes our proposals. we understand the commission will now consider them, which will likely entail seeking input from a range of industry participants.  we are subject to a consent decree and final judgment (final judgments) that resolved lawsuits brought by the u.s. department of justice, 18 states, and the district of columbia in two separate actions. the final judgments imposed various constraints on our windows operating system businesses. originally, the final judgments were scheduled to expire in november 2007. in 2006, we voluntarily agreed to extend certain elements of the final judgments to november 2009. the u.s. department of justice and other states advised the court that they would not seek any extension of the final judgments to which they are party. in january 2008, the court issued a decision granting the states motion to extend these additional provisions of the final judgments until november 2009. on april 16, 2009, we agreed with the department of justice and the states, respectively, to extend the final judgments to may 2011, and submitted to the u.s. district court for the district of columbia joint motions for this extension. in april 2009, the court entered an order approving the extension.  in other ongoing investigations, various foreign governments and several state attorneys general have requested information from us concerning competition, privacy, and security issues.  antitrust, unfair competition, and overcharge class actions  a large number of antitrust and unfair competition class action lawsuits have been filed against us in various state, federal, and canadian courts on behalf of various classes of direct and indirect purchasers of our pc operating system and certain other software products. we obtained dismissals of damages claims of indirect purchasers under federal law and in 15 states. courts refused to certify classes in two additional states. we have reached agreements to settle all claims that have been made to date in 19 states and the district of columbia.  under the settlements, generally class members can obtain vouchers that entitle them to be reimbursed for purchases of a wide variety of platform-neutral computer hardware and software. the total value of vouchers that we may issue varies by state. we will make available to certain schools a percentage of those vouchers that are not issued or claimed (one-half to two-thirds depending on the state). the total value of vouchers we ultimately issue will depend on the number of class members who make claims and are issued vouchers. the maximum value of vouchers to be issued is approximately $2.7 billion. the actual costs of these settlements will be less than that maximum amount, depending on the number of class members and schools that are issued and redeem vouchers.  the settlements in all states except arizona have received final court approval. cases in canada have not been settled. we estimate the total cost to resolve all of the overcharge class action cases will range between $1.8 billion and $2.0 billion. the actual cost depends on factors such as the claim rate, the quantity and mix of products for which claims are made, the number of eligible class members who ultimately use the vouchers, the nature of hardware and software that is acquired using the vouchers, and the cost of administering the claims. at june 30, 2009, we have recorded a liability related to these claims of approximately $800 million, which reflects our estimated exposure of $1.8 billion less payments made to date of approximately $1.0 billion mostly for vouchers, legal fees, and administrative expenses.  other antitrust litigation and claims  in november 2004, novell, inc. filed a complaint in u.s. district court, asserting antitrust and unfair competition claims against us related to novells ownership of wordperfect and other productivity applications during the period between june 1994 and march 1996. this case was transferred to maryland. in june 2005, the trial court granted our motion to dismiss four of nine claims of the complaint. both parties appealed, and in october 2007, the court of appeals affirmed the decision of the trial court, and remanded the case to that court for further proceedings. fact discovery has closed and summary judgment motions are expected to be filed in the fall.  patent and intellectual property claims  in 2003 we filed an action in u.s. district court in california seeking a declaratory judgment that we do not infringe certain alcatel-lucent patents (although this action began before the merger of alcatel and lucent in 2006, for simplicity we refer to the post-merger entity of alcatel-lucent). in april 2008, a jury returned a verdict in alcatel-lucents favor in a trial on a consolidated group of one video and three user interface patents. the jury concluded that we had infringed two user interface patents and awarded $367 million in damages. in june 2008, the trial judge increased the amount of damages to $512 million to include $145 million of interest. we have appealed that award to the federal circuit. in december 2008, we entered into a settlement agreement resolving all other litigation

table of contents   part ii   item 8       pending between microsoft and alcatel-lucent, leaving approximately $500 million remaining in dispute. in april 2009, the u.s. patent and trademark office, after a reexamination of the remaining patent in dispute, determined that the patent was invalid and alcatel-lucent has appealed that ruling.  in october 2003, uniloc usa inc., a subsidiary of a singapore-based security technology company, filed a patent infringement suit in u.s. district court in rhode island, claiming that product activation technology in windows xp and certain other microsoft programs violated a uniloc patent. after we obtained a favorable summary judgment that we did not infringe any of the claims of this patent, the court of appeals vacated the trial court decision and remanded the case for trial. in april 2009, the jury returned a $388 million verdict against us, including a finding of willful infringement. we are seeking to overturn this verdict via post-trial motions and, if necessary, will appeal, based on evidence that our product activation technology does not infringe the patent, that the patent is invalid, and that the damages were unsupported. with pre-judgment interest, approximately $500 million is in dispute.  in march 2007, i4i limited partnership, based in canada, sued microsoft in u.s. district court in the eastern district of texas, claiming that certain custom xml technology in word 2003 and 2007 infringed i4is patent. in may 2009, a jury returned a verdict against us, finding damages of $200 million and that we willfully infringed the patent. our defense of inequitable conduct has not yet been ruled upon, and we are also seeking to overturn the verdict via post-trial motions and, if necessary, via appeal. with pre-judgment interest, approximately $240 million is in dispute.  there are over 50 other patent infringement cases pending against microsoft, 10 of which are set for trial in fiscal year 2010.  other  we also are subject to a variety of other claims and suits that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of our business. although management currently believes that resolving claims against us, individually or in aggregate, will not have a material adverse impact on our financial position, our results of operations, or our cash flows, these matters are subject to inherent uncertainties and managements view of these matters may change in the future.  as of june 30, 2009, we had accrued aggregate liabilities of approximately $800 million in other current liabilities and approximately $400 million in other long-term liabilities for all of the contingent matters described in this note. while we intend to vigorously defend these matters, there exists the possibility of adverse outcomes that we estimate could be up to $2.2 billion in aggregate beyond recorded amounts. the foregoing amount does not include the january 15, 2009 european commission statement of objections, the outcome and range of which is not reasonably estimable. were unfavorable final outcomes to occur, there exists the possibility of a material adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows for the period in which the effects become reasonably estimable.  note 18    stockholders equity  shares outstanding  shares of common stock outstanding were as follows:    share repurchases  on september 22, 2008, we announced the completion of the two repurchase programs approved by our board of directors during the first quarter of fiscal year 2007 to buy back up to $40.0 billion of microsoft common stock. on september 22, 2008, we also announced that our board of directors approved a new share repurchase program

table of contents   part ii   item 8      executive officer incentive plan  in fiscal year 2009, the compensation committee approved a new executive officer incentive plan (eoip) for executive officers of the company. the eoip replaced the annual cash bonus opportunity and equity award plans for executive officers. under the eoip, the compensation committee makes awards of performance-based compensation for specified performance periods. for fiscal year 2009, executive officers were eligible to receive annual awards comprised of cash and sas from an incentive pool funded based on the achievement of operating income targets. following approval of the awards for fiscal year 2009, 20% of the award will be paid to the executive officers in cash, and the remaining 80% will be converted into an sa for shares of microsoft common stock. the sa portion of the award will vest one-quarter immediately after the award is approved following fiscal year 2009, and one-quarter on august 31 of each of the following three years.  the company will grant awards to the executive officers in september 2009 based on the performance period of july 1, 2008 through june 30, 2009, from an incentive pool equal to 0.35% of the companys fiscal year 2009 operating income. each executive officer will receive a fixed percentage of the pool ranging between 0 and 150% of a target based on an assessment of the executive officers performance during fiscal year 2009. the number of shares subject to the sa portion of the award will be determined by dividing the value of the award by the closing price of microsoft common stock on august 31, 2009.  activity for all stock plans  we measure the fair value of sas and spsas based upon the market price of the underlying common stock as of the date of grant, reduced by the present value of estimated future dividends. sas and spsas eoip are amortized over their applicable vesting period (generally four to five years) using the straight-line method. the fair value of each award grant is estimated on the date of grant using the following assumptions:    during fiscal year 2009, the following activity occurred under our existing plans:    as of june 30, 2009, there was $3.8 billion and $551 million of total unrecognized compensation costs related to sas and spsas, respectively. these costs are expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 3.5 years and 2.5 years, respectively.

table of contents   part ii   item 8      note 21    employee severance  in january 2009, we announced and implemented a resource management program to reduce discretionary operating expenses, employee headcount, and capital expenditures. as part of this program, we announced the elimination of up to 5,000 positions in research and development, marketing, sales, finance, legal, human resources, and information technology by june 30, 2010.  during the fiscal year ended june 30, 2009, we recorded charges of $330 million for the expected reduction in employee headcount which was recorded as corporate-level activity. during the year we had a net reduction of approximately 4,400 positions under the resource management program.  the changes in our employee severance liabilities were as follows:    note 22    segment information and geographic data  segment revenue and operating income (loss) was as follows:             



table of contents   part ii   item 8      sfas no. 131, disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information, establishes standards for reporting information about operating segments. this standard requires segmentation based on our internal organization and reporting of revenue and operating income (loss) based upon internal accounting methods. our financial reporting systems present various data for management to operate the business, including internal profit and loss statements prepared on a basis not consistent with u.s. gaap. the segments are designed to allocate resources internally and provide a framework to determine management responsibility. amounts for prior periods have been recast to conform to the current management view. operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise about which separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker, or decision making group, in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance. our chief operating decision maker is our chief executive officer. our five segments are client; server and tools; online services business; microsoft business division; and entertainment and devices division.  the types of products and services provided by each segment are summarized below:  client  windows vista, including home basic, home premium, ultimate, business, enterprise and starter edition; windows xp, including professional, home, media center, and tablet pc edition; and other standard windows operating systems.  server and tools  windows server operating system; microsoft sql server; visual studio; silverlight; system center products; forefront security products; biz talk server; microsoft consulting services; premier product support services; and other products and services.  online services business  bing; microsoft adcenter/adexpert; microsoft media network (mmn); msn portals, channels, and mobile services; windows live suite of applications and mobile services; atlas online tools for advertisers and publishers; msn premium web services (consisting of msn internet software subscription, msn hotmail plus, and msn software services); and razorfish media agency services.  microsoft business division  microsoft office; microsoft office project; microsoft office visio; microsoft office sharepoint server; fast esp; microsoft exchange server; microsoft exchange hosted services; microsoft office live meeting; microsoft office communications server; microsoft office communicator; microsoft tellme service; microsoft dynamics erp products including ax, nav, gp, sl, retail management system, and point of sale; microsoft dynamics crm; and microsoft dynamics crm online.  entertainment and devices division  xbox 360 console and games; xbox live; zune; mediaroom; numerous consumer software and hardware products (such as mice and keyboards); windows mobile software and services platform; windows embedded device operating system; windows automotive; and the microsoft surface computing platform.  because of our integrated business structure, operating costs included in one segment may benefit other segments, and therefore these segments are not designed to measure operating income or loss directly related to the products included in each segment. inter-segment cost commissions are estimated by management and used to compensate or charge each segment for such shared costs and to incent shared efforts. management will continually evaluate the alignment of product development organizations, sales organizations, and inter-segment commissions for segment reporting purposes, which may result in changes to segment allocations in future periods.  assets are not allocated to segments for internal reporting presentations. a portion of amortization and depreciation is included with various other costs in an overhead allocation to each segment and it is impracticable for us to separately identify the amount of amortization and depreciation by segment that is included in the measure of segment profit or loss.  reconciling amounts include adjustments to conform with u.s. gaap and corporate-level activity not specifically attributed to a segment. significant internal accounting policies that differ from u.s. gaap relate to revenue recognition, income statement classification, and accelerated amortization for depreciation, stock awards, and performance-based stock awards. in addition, certain revenue and expenses are excluded from segments or included in corporate-level activity including certain legal settlements and accruals for legal contingencies.
