## Item 1A


 table of contents    part i  item 1a     be distributed broadly and quickly at relatively low cost. many of the areas in which we compete evolve rapidly with changing and disruptive technologies, shifting user needs, and frequent introductions of new products and services. our ability to remain competitive depends on our success in making innovative products, devices, and services that appeal to businesses and consumers.  competition among platforms, ecosystems, and devices  an important element of our business model has been to create platform-based ecosystems on which many participants can build diverse solutions. a well-established ecosystem creates beneficial network effects among users, application developers, and the platform provider that can accelerate growth. establishing significant scale in the marketplace is necessary to achieve and maintain attractive margins. the strategic importance of developing and maintaining a vibrant ecosystem increased with the launch of the windows 8 operating system, surface, windows phone, xbox one, and associated cloud-based services. we face significant competition from firms that provide competing platforms, applications, and services.          business model competition  companies compete with us based on a growing variety of business models.      16 



 table of contents    part i  item 1a      the competitive pressures described above may cause decreased sales volumes, price reductions, and/or increased operating costs, such as for research and development, marketing, and sales incentives. this may lead to lower revenue, gross margins, and operating income.  our increasing focus on services presents execution and competitive risks.    a growing part of our business involves cloud-based services available across the spectrum of computing devices. in july 2014, our leadership announced its strategic vision to compete and grow as a productivity and platform company for the mobile-first and cloud-first world. at the same time, our competitors are rapidly developing and deploying cloud-based services for consumers and business customers. pricing and delivery models are evolving. devices and form factors influence how users access services in the cloud and sometimes the users choice of which suite of cloud-based services to use. we are devoting significant resources to develop and deploy our cloud-based strategies. the windows ecosystem must continue to evolve with this changing environment. we are embracing cultural and organizational changes to drive accountability and eliminate obstacles to innovation. besides software development costs, we are incurring costs to build and maintain infrastructure to support cloud computing services. these costs will reduce the operating margins we have previously achieved. whether we succeed in cloud-based services depends on our execution in several areas, including:            it is uncertain whether our strategies will attract the users or generate the revenue required to succeed. if we are not effective in executing organizational changes to increase efficiency and accelerate innovation, or if we fail to generate sufficient usage of our new products and services, we may not grow revenues in line with the infrastructure and development investments described above. this may negatively impact gross margins and operating income.  we make significant investments in new products and services that may not be profitable.    we will continue to make significant investments in research, development, and marketing for existing products, services, and technologies, including the windows operating system, the microsoft office system, bing, windows phone, windows server, the windows store, the microsoft azure services platform, office 365, other cloud-based services offerings, and the xbox entertainment platform. we also invest in the development and acquisition of a variety of hardware for productivity, communication and entertainment including pcs, tablets, phones, and gaming devices. investments in new technology are speculative. commercial success depends on many factors, including innovativeness, developer support, and effective distribution and marketing. if customers do not perceive our latest offerings as providing significant new functionality or other value, they may reduce their purchases of new software and hardware products or upgrades, unfavorably affecting revenue. we may not achieve significant revenue from new product, service, and    17 



 table of contents    part i  item 1a     distribution channel investments for several years, if at all. new products and services may not be profitable, and even if they are profitable, operating margins for some new products and businesses will not be as high as the margins we have experienced historically.  developing new technologies is complex and time-consuming. it can require long development and testing periods. significant delays in new releases or significant problems in creating new products or services could adversely affect our revenue.  acquisitions, joint ventures, and strategic alliances may have an adverse effect on our business.    we expect to continue making acquisitions or entering into joint ventures and strategic alliances as part of our long-term business strategy. these transactions involve significant challenges and risks including that the transaction does not advance our business strategy, that we get no satisfactory return on our investment, that we have difficulty integrating new employees, business systems, and technology, or that the transaction distracts management from our other businesses. the success of these transactions will depend in part on our ability to leverage them enhance our existing products and services or develop compelling new ones. it may take longer than expected to realize the full benefits from these transactions, such as increased revenue, enhanced efficiencies, or increased market share, or the benefits may ultimately be smaller than we expected. these events could adversely affect our operating results or financial condition.  in april 2014, we acquired from nokia substantially all of its nds business to accelerate our growth in phones and support the entire windows ecosystem. we may not realize all of the anticipated financial and other benefits from this transaction including operating efficiencies and cost savings. we may not be successful in developing a vibrant and competitive ecosystem for windows-based phones that combines differentiated hardware, software, services, and third-party applications. we may not achieve mobile phone market share targets. we may see lower than expected growth rates for the phone markets. the mix of premium and lower-cost devices we sell may put downward pressure on prices or margins. we may not be effective in executing the restructuring we announced in july 2014 or otherwise integrating the nds business with microsofts ongoing operations, including matching manufacturing capacity to demand. existing microsoft smart device original equipment manufacturers may respond negatively to the changes in our business or the new competitive environment.  if our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets become impaired we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings.    we acquire other companies and intangible assets and may not realize all the economic benefit from those acquisitions, which could cause an impairment of goodwill or intangibles. we review our amortizable intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. we test goodwill for impairment at least annually. factors that may be a change in circumstances, indicating that the carrying value of our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets may not be recoverable, include a decline in our stock price and market capitalization, reduced future cash flow estimates, and slower growth rates in industry segments in which we participate. we may be required to record a significant charge in our consolidated financial statements during the period in which any impairment of our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets is determined, negatively affecting our results of operations. for example, in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2012, we recorded a $6.2 billion charge for the impairment of goodwill in our previous online services division business (devices and consumer other under our current segment structure).  the valuation of acquired assets and liabilities, including goodwill, resulting from the acquisition of nds, is reflective of the enterprise value based on the long-term financial forecast for the business. in this highly competitive and volatile market, we may not realize our forecasts. as a result, we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings in our consolidated financial statements due to an impairment of our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets.  we may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property rights.    protecting our global intellectual property rights and combating unlicensed copying and use of our software and other intellectual property is difficult. while piracy adversely affects u.s. revenue, the impact on revenue from outside the u.s. is more significant, particularly in countries where laws are less protective of intellectual property rights. our revenue in these markets may grow slower than the underlying device market. similarly, the absence of harmonized patent laws makes it more difficult to ensure consistent respect for patent rights. throughout the world, we educate consumers about the    18 



 table of contents    part i  item 1a     benefits of licensing genuine products and obtaining indemnification benefits for intellectual property risks, and we educate lawmakers about the advantages of a business climate where intellectual property rights are protected. reductions in the legal protection for software intellectual property rights could adversely affect revenue.  third parties may claim we infringe their intellectual property rights.    from time to time, others claim we infringe their intellectual property rights. the number of these claims may grow because of constant technological change in the markets in which we compete, the extensive patent coverage of existing technologies, the rapid rate of issuance of new patents, and our offering of first-party devices, such as surface and lumia phones. to resolve these claims we may enter into royalty and licensing agreements on terms that are less favorable than currently available, stop selling or redesign affected products or services, or pay damages to satisfy indemnification commitments with our customers. these outcomes may cause operating margins to decline. besides money damages, in some jurisdictions plaintiffs can seek injunctive relief that may limit or prevent importing, marketing, and selling our products or services that have infringing technologies. in some countries, such as germany, an injunction can be issued before the parties have fully litigated the validity of the underlying patents. we have paid significant amounts to settle claims related to the use of technology and intellectual property rights and to procure intellectual property rights as part of our strategy to manage this risk, and may continue to do so.  we may not be able to protect our source code from copying if there is an unauthorized disclosure of source code.    source code, the detailed program commands for our operating systems and other software programs, is critical to our business. although we license portions of our application and operating system source code to several licensees, we take significant measures to protect the secrecy of large portions of our source code. if a significant portion of our source code leaks, we might lose future trade secret protection for that source code. it may become easier for third parties to compete with our products by copying functionality, which could adversely affect our revenue and operating margins. unauthorized disclosure of source code also could increase the security risks described in the next paragraph.  cyber-attacks and security vulnerabilities could lead to reduced revenue, increased costs, liability claims, or harm to our competitive position.  security of microsofts information technology  threats to information technology (it) security can take a variety of forms. individual and groups of hackers, and sophisticated organizations including state-sponsored organizations, may take steps that pose threats to our customers and our it. they may develop and deploy malicious software to attack our products and services and gain access to our networks and datacenters, or act in a coordinated manner to launch distributed denial of service or other coordinated attacks. cyber threats are constantly evolving, thereby increasing the difficulty of detecting and successfully defending against them. cyber threats can have cascading impacts that unfold with increasing speed across our internal networks and systems and those of our partners and customers. breaches of our network or data security could disrupt the security of our internal systems and business applications, impair our ability to provide services to our customers and protect the privacy of their data, result in product development delays, compromise confidential or technical business information harming our competitive position, result in theft or misuse of our intellectual property or other assets, require us to allocate more resources to improved technologies, or otherwise adversely affect our business.  in addition, our internal it environment continues to evolve. often we are early adopters of new devices and technologies. we embrace new ways of sharing data and communicating internally and with partners and customers using methods such as social networking and other consumer-oriented technologies. our business policies and internal security controls may not keep pace with the speed of these changes as new threats emerge.  security of our product, services, devices and customers data  security threats are a particular challenge to companies like us whose business is technology products and services. threats to our own it infrastructure can also affect our customers. customers using our cloud-based services rely on the security of our infrastructure to ensure the reliability of our services and the protection of their data. hackers    19 



 table of contents    part i  item 1a     tend to focus their efforts on the most popular operating systems, programs, and services, including many of ours, and we expect that to continue. the security of our products and services is important in our customers purchasing decisions.  to defend against security threats, both to our internal it systems and those of our customers, we must continuously engineer more secure products and services, enhance security and reliability features, improve the deployment of software updates to address security vulnerabilities, develop mitigation technologies that help to secure customers from attacks even when software updates are not deployed, maintain the digital security infrastructure that protects the integrity of our network, products and services, and provide customers security tools such as firewalls and anti-virus software.  the cost of these steps could reduce our operating margins. if we fail to do these things well, actual or perceived security vulnerabilities in our products and services could harm our reputation and lead customers to reduce or delay future purchases of products or subscriptions to services, or to use competing products or services. customers may also spend more on protecting their existing computer systems from attack, which could delay adoption of additional products or services. customers may fail to update their systems, continue to run software or operating systems we no longer support, or may fail timely to install security patches. any of these actions by customers could adversely affect our revenue. actual or perceived vulnerabilities may lead to claims against us. although our license agreements typically contain provisions that eliminate or limit our exposure to liability, there is no assurance these provisions will withstand legal challenges. legislative or regulatory action in these areas may increase the costs to develop, implement or secure our products and services.  disclosure of personal data could cause liability and harm our reputation.    as we continue to grow the number and scale of our cloud-based offerings, we store and process increasingly large amounts of personally identifiable information of our customers. the continued occurrence of high-profile data breaches provides evidence of an external environment increasingly hostile to information security. despite our efforts to improve the security controls across our business groups and geographies, it is possible our security controls over personal data, our training of employees and vendors on data security, and other practices we follow may not prevent the improper disclosure of customer data we or our vendors store and manage. improper disclosure could harm our reputation, lead to legal exposure to customers, or subject us to liability under laws that protect personal data, resulting in increased costs or loss of revenue. our software products and services also enable our customers to store and process personal data on-premises or, increasingly, in a cloud-based environment we host. like all providers of communications services, government authorities can sometimes require us to produce customer data in response to valid legal orders. in the u.s. and elsewhere, we advocate for transparency concerning these requests and appropriate limitations on government authority to compel disclosure. despite our efforts to protect customer data, perceptions that the privacy of personal information is not satisfactorily protected could inhibit sales of our products or services, and could limit adoption of our cloud-based solutions by consumers, businesses, and government entities. additional security measures we may take to address customer concerns, or constraints on our flexibility to determine where and how to operate datacenters in response to customer expectations or governmental rules or actions, may cause higher operating expenses.  we may have outages, data losses, and disruptions of our online services if we fail to maintain an adequate operations infrastructure.    our increasing user traffic, growth in services and the complexity of our products and services demand more computing power. we spend substantial amounts to build, purchase or lease datacenters and equipment and to upgrade our technology and network infrastructure to handle more traffic on our websites and in our datacenters. these demands continue to increase as we introduce new products and services and support the growth of existing services such as bing, exchange online, office 365, sharepoint online, onedrive, skype, xbox live, microsoft azure, outlook.com, microsoft office web apps, windows stores and microsoft account services. we are rapidly growing our business of providing a platform and back-end hosting for services provided by third-parties to their end users. maintaining, securing and expanding this infrastructure is expensive and complex. inefficiencies or operational failures, including temporary or permanent loss of customer data, could diminish the quality of our products, services, and user experience resulting in contractual liability, claims by customers and other third parties, damage to our reputation and loss of current and potential users, subscribers, and advertisers, each of which may harm our operating results and financial condition.    20 



 table of contents    part i  item 1a    government litigation and regulatory activity relating to competition rules may limit how we design and market our products.    as a leading global software and device maker, we are closely scrutinized by government agencies under u.s. and foreign competition laws. an increasing number of governments are regulating competition law activities and this includes increased scrutiny in potentially large markets such as china. some jurisdictions also allow competitors or consumers to assert claims of anti-competitive conduct. u.s. federal and state antitrust authorities have previously brought enforcement actions and continue to scrutinize our business.  the european commission closely scrutinizes the design of high-volume microsoft products and the terms on which we make certain technologies used in these products, such as file formats, programming interfaces, and protocols, available to other companies. in 2004, the commission ordered us to create new versions of windows that do not include certain multimedia technologies and to provide our competitors with specifications for how to implement certain proprietary windows communications protocols in their own products. in 2009, the commission accepted a set of commitments offered by microsoft to address the commissions concerns relating to competition in web browsing software, including an undertaking to address commission concerns relating to interoperability. these obligations may limit our ability to innovate in windows or other products in the future, diminish the developer appeal of the windows platform, and increase our product development costs. the availability of licenses related to protocols and file formats may enable competitors to develop software products that better mimic the functionality of our products, which could hamper sales of our products.  our portfolio of first-party devices continues to grow; at the same time our oem partners offer a large variety of devices on our platforms. as a result, increasingly we both cooperate and compete with our oem partners, creating a risk that we fail to do so in compliance with competition rules. regulatory scrutiny in this area may increase. certain foreign governments, particularly in china and other countries in asia, have advanced arguments under their competition laws that exert downward pressure on royalties for our intellectual property. because these jurisdictions only recently implemented competition laws, their enforcement activities are unpredictable.  government regulatory actions and court decisions such as these may hinder our ability to provide the benefits of our software to consumers and businesses, reducing the attractiveness of our products and the revenue that come from them. new competition law actions could be initiated. the outcome of such actions, or steps taken to avoid them, could adversely affect us in a variety of ways, including:          our international operations subject us to potential liability under anti-corruption, trade protection, and other laws and regulations.    the foreign corrupt practices act and other anti-corruption laws and regulations (anti-corruption laws) prohibit corrupt payments by our employees, vendors, or agents. from time to time, we receive inquiries from authorities in the u.s. and elsewhere about our business activities outside the u.s. and our compliance with anti-corruption laws. while we devote substantial resources to our global compliance programs and have implemented policies, training, and internal controls designed to reduce the risk of corrupt payments, our employees, vendors, or agents may violate our policies. our failure to comply with anti-corruption laws could result in significant fines and penalties, criminal sanctions against us, our officers or our employees, prohibitions on the conduct of our business, and damage to our reputation. operations outside the u.s. may be affected by changes in trade protection laws, policies and measures, and other regulatory requirements affecting trade and investment. we may be subject to legal liability and reputational damage if we sell goods or services in violation of u.s. trade sanctions on countries such as iran, north korea, cuba, sudan, and syria.    21 



 table of contents    part i  item 1a    other regulatory areas that may apply to our products and online services offerings include user privacy, telecommunications, data protection, and online content. for example, regulators may take the position that our offerings such as skype are covered by laws regulating telecommunications services. applying these laws and regulations to our business is often unclear, subject to change over time, and sometimes may conflict from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. additionally, these laws and governments approach to their enforcement, and our products and services, are continuing to evolve. some governments are expressing increasing concern about government surveillance practices around the world and this may lead to increased regulation requiring local hosting obligations or the use of domestic hosting providers. compliance with these types of regulation may involve significant costs or require changes in products or business practices that result in reduced revenue. noncompliance could result in the imposition of penalties or orders we stop the alleged noncompliant activity.  our business depends on our ability to attract and retain talented employees.    our business is based on successfully attracting and retaining talented employees. the market for highly skilled workers and leaders in our industry is extremely competitive. we are limited in our ability to recruit internationally by restrictive domestic immigration laws. if we are less successful in our recruiting efforts, or if we cannot retain key employees, including key employees of the nds business acquired in april 2014, our ability to develop and deliver successful products and services may be adversely affected. effective succession planning is also important to our long-term success. failure to ensure effective transfer of knowledge and smooth transitions involving key employees could hinder our strategic planning and execution.  we have claims and lawsuits against us that may result in adverse outcomes.    we are subject to a variety of claims and lawsuits. adverse outcomes in some or all of these claims may result in significant monetary damages or injunctive relief that could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business. the litigation and other claims are subject to inherent uncertainties and managements view of these matters may change in the future. a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements could occur for the period in which the effect of an unfavorable final outcome becomes probable and reasonably estimable.  we may have additional tax liabilities.    we are subject to income taxes in the u.s. and many foreign jurisdictions. significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes. in the ordinary course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. we regularly are under audit by tax authorities. economic and political pressures to increase tax revenues in various jurisdictions may make resolving tax disputes more difficult. although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals. the results of an audit or litigation could have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements in the period or periods for which that determination is made.  we earn a significant amount of our operating income from outside the u.s., and any repatriation of funds currently held in foreign jurisdictions to the u.s. may result in higher effective tax rates for the company. in addition, there have been proposals from congress to change u.s. tax laws that would significantly impact how u.s. multinational corporations are taxed on foreign earnings. although we cannot predict whether or in what form any proposed legislation may pass, if enacted it could have a material adverse impact on our tax expense and cash flows.  our hardware and software products may experience quality or supply problems.    our vertically-integrated hardware products such as xbox consoles, surface devices, lumia smartphones, and other devices we design and market are highly complex and can have defects in design, manufacture, or associated software. we could incur significant expenses, lost revenue, and reputational harm if we fail to detect or address such issues through design, testing, or warranty repairs. we get some device components from sole suppliers. our competitors use some of the same suppliers and their demand for hardware components can affect the capacity available to us. if a component from a sole-source supplier is delayed or becomes unavailable, whether because of supplier capacity constraint or industry shortages, we may not obtain timely replacement supplies, resulting in reduced sales. component shortages, excess or obsolete inventory, or price reductions resulting in inventory adjustments may increase our cost of revenue. xbox consoles and surface devices and lumia phones are assembled in asia and other geographies that may be subject to disruptions in the supply chain, resulting in shortages that would affect our revenue and operating margins. these same risks would apply to any other vertically-integrated hardware and software products we may offer.    22 



 table of contents    part i  item 1a    our software products also may experience quality or reliability problems. the highly sophisticated software products we develop may contain bugs and other defects that interfere with their intended operation. any defects we do not detect and fix in pre-release testing could cause reduced sales and revenue, damage to our reputation, repair or remediation costs, delays in the release of new products or versions, or legal liability. although our license agreements typically contain provisions that eliminate or limit our exposure to liability, there is no assurance these provisions will withstand legal challenge.  our global business exposes us to operational and economic risks.    we operate in over 100 countries and a significant part of our revenue comes from international sales. the global nature of our business creates operational and economic risks. emerging markets are a significant focus of our international growth strategy. the developing nature of these markets presents several risks, including deterioration of social, political, labor, or economic conditions in a country or region, and difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations. although we hedge a portion of our international currency exposure, significant fluctuations in exchange rates between the u.s. dollar and foreign currencies may adversely affect our revenue. competitive or regulatory pressure to make our pricing structure uniform might require that we reduce the sales price of our software in the u.s. and other countries.  catastrophic events or geo-political conditions may disrupt our business.    a disruption or failure of our systems or operations because of a major earthquake, weather event, cyber-attack, terrorist attack, or other catastrophic event could cause delays in completing sales, providing services, or performing other critical functions. our corporate headquarters, a significant portion of our research and development activities, and certain other essential business operations are in the seattle, washington area, and we have other business operations in the silicon valley area of california, both of which are near major earthquake faults. a catastrophic event that results in the destruction or disruption of any of our critical business or it systems could harm our ability to conduct normal business operations. providing our customers with more services and solutions in the cloud puts a premium on the resilience of our systems and strength of our business continuity management plans, and magnifies the potential impact of prolonged service outages on our operating results.  abrupt political change, terrorist activity, and armed conflict pose a risk of general economic disruption in affected countries, which may increase our operating costs. these conditions also may add uncertainty to the timing and budget for technology investment decisions by our customers, and may cause supply chain disruptions for hardware manufacturers, either of which may adversely affect our revenue. the long-term effects of climate change on the global economy or the it industry in particular are unclear. environmental regulations or changes in the supply, demand or available sources of energy may affect the availability or cost of goods and services, including natural resources, necessary to run our business. changes in weather where we operate may increase the costs of powering and cooling computer hardware we use to develop software and provide cloud-based services.  adverse economic or market conditions may harm our business.    worsening economic conditions, including inflation, recession, or other changes in economic conditions, may cause lower it spending and adversely affect our revenue. if demand for pcs, servers, and other computing devices declines, or consumer or business spending for those products declines, our revenue will be adversely affected. substantial revenue comes from our u.s. government contracts. an extended federal government shutdown resulting from failing to pass budget appropriations, adopt continuing funding resolutions or raise the debt ceiling, and other budgetary decisions limiting or delaying federal government spending, could reduce government it spending on our products and services and adversely affect our revenues. our product distribution system also relies on an extensive partner and retail network. oems building devices that run our software have also been a significant means of distribution. the impact of economic conditions on our partners, such as the bankruptcy of a major distributor, oem, or retailer, could cause sales channel disruption. challenging economic conditions also may impair the ability of our customers to pay for products and services they have purchased. as a result, allowances for doubtful accounts and write-offs of accounts receivable may increase. we maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings, types, and maturities. these investments are subject to general credit, liquidity, market, and interest rate risks, which may be exacerbated by unusual events that affect global financial markets. a significant part of our investment portfolio comprises u.s. government securities. if global credit and equity markets decline for long periods, or if there is a downgrade of the u.s. government credit rating due to an actual or threatened default on government debt, our investment portfolio may be adversely affected and we could determine that more of our investments have experienced an other-than-temporary decline in fair value, requiring impairment charges that could adversely affect our financial results.    23

## Item 7


 table of contents    part ii  item 7    with investments in these areas, we work to fulfill the evolving needs of our customers in a mobile-first and cloud-first world. we view mobility broadly  not just by devices, but by experiences. today, people move just as quickly into new contexts as to new locations. mobility goes beyond devices users carry with them as they move from place to place, to encompass the rich collection of data, applications, and services that accompany them as they move from setting to setting in their lives. many of our customers are dual users, employing technology for work or school and also deeply in their personal lives.  digital work and life experiences  we believe we can significantly enhance the digital lives of our customers using our broad portfolio of communication, productivity, and information services. we work to deliver digital work and life experiences that are reinvented for the mobile-first and cloud-first world. productivity will be the first and foremost objective, to enable people to meet and collaborate more easily, and to effectively express ideas in new ways. we will design applications as dual use with the intelligence to partition data between work and life while respecting each persons privacy choices. the foundation for these efforts will rest on advancing our leading productivity, collaboration, and business process tools including skype, onedrive, onenote, outlook, word, excel, powerpoint, bing, and dynamics.  we see opportunity in combining these services in new ways that are more contextual and personal, while ensuring people, rather than their devices, remain at the center of the digital experience. we will offer our services across ecosystems and devices outside our own. as people move from device to device, so will their content and the richness of their services. we will engineer applications so users can find, try, and buy them in friction-free ways.  cloud operating system  today, businesses face important opportunities and challenges. enterprises are asked to deploy technology that advances business strategy. they decide what solutions will make employees more productive, collaborative, and satisfied, or connect with customers in new and compelling ways. they work to unlock business insights from a world of data. they rely on our technology to manage employee corporate identity, and to manage and secure corporate information accessed and stored across a growing number of devices. to achieve these objectives increasingly businesses look to leverage the benefits of the cloud. helping businesses move to the cloud is one of our largest opportunities, and we believe we work from a position of strength.  the shift to the cloud is driven by three important economies of scale: larger datacenters can deploy computational resources at significantly lower cost per unit than smaller ones; larger datacenters can coordinate and aggregate diverse customer, geographic, and application demand patterns improving the utilization of computing, storage, and network resources; and multi-tenancy lowers application maintenance labor costs for large public clouds. the cloud creates the opportunity for businesses to focus on innovation while leaving non-differentiating activities to reliable and cost-effective providers.  with azure, we are one of very few cloud vendors that run at a scale that meets the needs of businesses of all sizes and complexities. we believe the combination of azure and windows server makes us the only company with a public, private, and hybrid cloud platform that can power modern business. we are working to enhance the return on it investment by enabling enterprises to combine their existing datacenters and our public cloud into a single cohesive infrastructure. businesses can deploy applications in their own datacenter, a partners datacenter, or in our datacenters with common security, management, and administration across all environments, with the flexibility and scale they desire.  our cloud will also enable richer employee experiences. we enable organizations to securely adopt software-as-a-service applications (both our own and third-party) and integrate them with their existing security and management infrastructure. we will continue to innovate with higher level services including identity and directory services, rich data storage and analytics services, machine learning services, media services, web, and mobile backend services, and developer productivity services. to foster a rich developer ecosystem, our digital work    27 



 table of contents    part ii  item 7     and life experiences will also be extensible, enabling customers and partners to further customize and enhance our solutions, achieving even more value. our strategy requires continuing investment in datacenters and other infrastructure to support our devices and services, and will bring continued competition with google, amazon, and other well-established and emerging competitors.  device operating system and hardware  with our windows device operating system and first-party hardware, we strive to set the standard for productivity experiences. we aim to deliver the richest and most consistent user experience for digital work and life scenarios on screens of all sizes  from phones, tablets, and laptops to tvs and large, multi-touch displays. we are investing to make windows the most secure, manageable, and capable operating system for the needs of a modern workforce. we are working to create a broad developer opportunity by enabling universal windows applications to run across all device targets. we are developing new input/output methods like speech, pen, and gesture to power more personal computing experiences.  we work with an ecosystem of partners to deliver a broad spectrum of windows devices. we also build first-party hardware to set the standard for productivity experiences and stimulate more demand for the entire windows ecosystem, as we do with surface, and with the acquisition of substantially all nokia corporations (nokia) devices and services business (nds) on april 25, 2014, phones. as consumer services and hardware advance, we expect they will continue to better complement one another, connecting the devices people use daily to unique communications, productivity, and entertainment services from microsoft and our partners and developers. we anticipate many new mobile device categories and we anticipate experiences to emerge that span a variety of devices of all screen sizes. we will invest to be on the forefront of this innovation focusing on dual users and their needs across work and life. with the acquisition of nds, we expect our effective tax rate to increase as our business mix changes.  our future opportunity  there are several distinct areas of technology that we aim to drive forward. our goal is to lead the industry in these areas over the long term, which we expect will translate to sustained growth. we are investing significant resources in:            we believe the breadth of our products and services portfolio, our large, global partner and customer base, our growing ecosystem, and our ongoing investment in innovation position us to be a leader in these areas.  economic conditions, challenges, and risks  the market for software, devices, and cloud-based services is dynamic and highly competitive. our competitors are developing new software and devices, while also deploying competing cloud-based services for consumers and businesses. the devices and form factors customers prefer evolve rapidly, and influence how users access services in the cloud and in some cases the users choice of which suite of cloud-based services to use. we must continue to evolve and adapt over an extended time in pace with this changing environment. to support our strategy of    28 



 table of contents    part ii  item 7     reinventing productivity to empower every person and every organization to do more and achieve more, we announced a restructuring plan in july 2014. through this restructuring, we strive to increase agility, streamline engineering processes, move faster and more efficiently, and simplify our organization. even if we achieve these goals, the investments we are making in devices and infrastructure will increase our operating costs and may decrease our operating margins.  we prioritize our investments among the highest long-term growth opportunities. these investments require significant resources and are multi-year in nature. the products and services we bring to market may be developed internally, as part of a partnership or alliance, or through acquisition.  our success is highly dependent on our ability to attract and retain qualified employees. we hire a mix of university and industry talent worldwide. microsoft competes for talented individuals globally by offering an exceptional working environment, broad customer reach, scale in resources, the ability to grow ones career across many different products and businesses, and competitive compensation and benefits. aggregate demand for our software, services, and devices is correlated to global macroeconomic and geopolitical factors, which remain dynamic. see a discussion of these factors and other risks under risk factors (part i, item 1a of this form 10-k).  unearned revenue  quarterly and annual revenue may be impacted by the deferral of revenue. see the discussions below regarding:      if our customers choose to license cloud-based versions of our products and services rather than licensing transaction-based products and services, the associated revenue will shift from being recognized at the time of the transaction to being recognized over the subscription period or upon consumption, as applicable.  reportable segments  the segment amounts included in md&a are presented on a basis consistent with our internal management reporting. segment information appearing in note 21  segment information and geographic data of the notes to financial statements (part ii, item 8 of this form 10-k) is also presented on this basis. all differences between our internal management reporting basis and accounting principles generally accepted in the u.s. (u.s. gaap), along with certain corporate-level and other activity, are included in corporate and other. operating expenses are not allocated to our segments.  during the first quarter of fiscal year 2014, we changed our organizational structure as part of our transformation to a devices and services company. as a result, information that our chief operating decision maker regularly reviews for purposes of allocating resources and assessing performance changed. therefore, we have recast certain prior period amounts to conform to the way we internally managed and monitored segment performance during fiscal year 2014. our reportable segments are described below.  on april 25, 2014, we acquired substantially all of nds for total consideration of $9.5 billion. this amount was greater than the $7.2 billion disclosed previously, primarily due to $1.5 billion of cash acquired, foreign currency movements of $330 million, working capital adjustments of $210 million, and other adjustments of $260 million. see note 9  business combinations of the notes to financial statements for additional details. nds has been included in our consolidated results of operations starting on the acquisition date. we report the financial performance of the acquired business in our new phone hardware segment. prior to the acquisition of nds, financial results associated with our joint strategic initiatives with nokia were reflected in our d&c licensing segment. the contractual relationship with nokia related to those initiatives terminated in conjunction with the acquisition. with the creation of the new phone hardware segment, the d&c hardware segment was renamed computing and gaming hardware in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2014.    29

 table of contents    part ii  item 7    goodwill impairment  we test goodwill for impairment annually on may 1 at the reporting unit level using a discounted cash flow methodology with a peer-based, risk-adjusted weighted average cost of capital. no impairment of goodwill was identified as of may 1, 2014 or may 2013. our goodwill impairment test as of may 1, 2012, indicated that the carrying value of our previous online services division reporting unit (in devices and consumer other under our current segment structure) exceeded its estimated fair value. accordingly, we recorded a non-cash, non-tax deductible goodwill impairment charge of $6.2 billion during the three months ended june 30, 2012, reducing the units goodwill from $6.4 billion to $223 million.  integration and restructuring  integration and restructuring expenses consist of transaction fees and direct acquisition costs, including legal, finance, consulting, and other professional fees. integration and restructuring expenses also include employee compensation and termination costs associated with certain reorganization activities.  integration and restructuring expenses were $127 million for fiscal year 2014, reflecting expenses associated with the acquisition and integration of nds.  other income (expense)  the components of other income (expense) were as follows:    we use derivative instruments to: manage risks related to foreign currencies, equity prices, interest rates, and credit; enhance investment returns; and facilitate portfolio diversification. gains and losses from changes in fair values of derivatives that are not designated as hedges are primarily recognized in other income (expense). other than those derivatives entered into for investment purposes, such as commodity contracts, the gains (losses) are generally economically offset by unrealized gains (losses) in the underlying available-for-sale securities, which are recorded as a component of other comprehensive income (oci) until the securities are sold or other-than-temporarily impaired, at which time the amounts are reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income (aoci) into other income (expense).  fiscal year 2014 compared with fiscal year 2013  dividends and interest income increased due to higher portfolio balances. interest expense increased due to higher outstanding long-term debt. net recognized gains on investments increased primarily due to higher gains on sales of equity securities and lower other-than-temporary impairments. other-than-temporary impairments were $106 million in fiscal year 2014, compared with $208 million in fiscal year 2013. net losses on derivatives increased due to higher losses on foreign exchange contracts, losses on equity derivatives as compared to gains in the prior period, offset in part by gains on commodity and interest rate derivatives as compared to losses in the prior period. for fiscal year 2014, other reflects recognized losses from certain joint ventures, offset in part by a recognized gain on a divestiture. for fiscal year 2013, other reflects recognized gains on divestitures, including the gain recognized upon the divestiture of our 50% share in the msnbc joint venture.    38 



 table of contents    part ii  item 7    fiscal year 2013 compared with fiscal year 2012  dividends and interest income decreased due to lower yields on our fixed-income investments, offset in part by higher average portfolio investment balances. net recognized gains on investments decreased primarily due to lower gains on sales of equity and fixed-income securities and a gain recognized on the partial sale of our facebook holding in the prior year, offset in part by lower other-than-temporary impairments. other-than-temporary impairments were $208 million in fiscal year 2013, compared with $298 million in fiscal year 2012. net losses on derivatives decreased due to gains on equity derivatives in the current fiscal year as compared with losses in the prior fiscal year, and lower losses on commodity and foreign exchange derivatives as compared to the prior fiscal year, offset in part by losses on interest-rate derivatives in the current fiscal year as compared to gains in the prior fiscal year. for the current year, other reflects recognized gains on divestitures, including the gain recognized upon the divestiture of our 50% share in the msnbc joint venture.  income taxes  fiscal year 2014 compared with fiscal year 2013  our effective tax rate for fiscal years 2014 and 2013 was approximately 21% and 19%, respectively. our effective tax rate was lower than the u.s. federal statutory rate primarily due to earnings taxed at lower rates in foreign jurisdictions resulting from producing and distributing our products and services through our foreign regional operations centers in ireland, singapore, and puerto rico.  our fiscal year 2014 effective rate increased by 2% from fiscal year 2013 mainly due to adjustments of $458 million to prior years liabilities for intercompany transfer pricing that increased taxable income in more highly taxed jurisdictions, as well as losses incurred by nds and changes in the geographic mix of our business. this was offset in part by favorable transfer pricing developments in certain foreign tax jurisdictions, primarily denmark.  changes in the mix of income before income taxes between the u.s. and foreign countries also impacted our effective tax rates and resulted primarily from changes in the geographic distribution of and changes in consumer demand for our products and services. we supply our windows pc operating system to customers through our u.s. regional operating center, while we supply the microsoft office system and our server products and tools to customers through our foreign regional operations centers. windows pc operating system revenue decreased $655 million in fiscal year 2014, while microsoft office system and server products and tools revenue increased $1.3 billion and $1.6 billion, respectively, during this same period. in fiscal years 2014 and 2013, our u.s. income before income taxes was $7.1 billion and $6.7 billion, respectively, and comprised 26% and 25%, respectively, of our income before income taxes. in fiscal years 2014 and 2013, the foreign income before income taxes was $20.7 billion and $20.4 billion, respectively, and comprised 74% and 75%, respectively, of our income before income taxes.  tax contingencies and other tax liabilities were $10.4 billion and $9.4 billion as of june 30, 2014 and 2013, respectively, and are included in other long-term liabilities. this increase relates primarily to adjustments to prior years liabilities for intercompany transfer pricing and adjustments related to our irs audits. while we settled a portion of the i.r.s. audit for tax years 2004 to 2006 during the third quarter of fiscal year 2011, we remain under audit for those years. in february 2012, the i.r.s. withdrew its 2011 revenue agents report and reopened the audit phase of the examination. as of june 30, 2014, the primary unresolved issue relates to transfer pricing which could have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements if not resolved favorably. we have not received a proposed assessment for the unresolved issues and do not expect a final resolution of these issues in the next 12 months. based on the information currently available, we do not anticipate a significant increase or decrease to our tax contingencies for these issues. we also continue to be subject to examination by the i.r.s. for tax years 2007 to 2013.  we are subject to income tax in many jurisdictions outside the u.s. our operations in certain jurisdictions remain subject to examination for tax years 1996 to 2013, some of which are currently under audit by local tax authorities. the resolutions of these audits are not expected to be material to our consolidated financial statements.    39 



 table of contents    part ii  item 7    fiscal year 2013 compared with fiscal year 2012  our effective tax rate for fiscal years 2013 and 2012 was approximately 19% and 24%, respectively. our effective tax rate was lower than the u.s. federal statutory rate primarily due to earnings taxed at lower rates in foreign jurisdictions resulting from producing and distributing our products and services through our foreign regional operations centers in ireland, singapore, and puerto rico.  our fiscal year 2013 effective rate decreased by 5% from fiscal year 2012 mainly due to a nonrecurring $6.2 billion non-tax deductible goodwill impairment charge that was recorded in fiscal year 2012. the goodwill impairment charge increased our effective tax rate by 10% in fiscal year 2012. in addition, in fiscal years 2013 and 2012, we recognized a reduction of 18% and 21%, respectively, to the effective tax rate due to foreign earnings taxed at lower rates. the decrease in our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2013 was primarily offset by a 1% increase related to the eu fine, which is not tax deductible.  changes in the mix of income before income taxes between the u.s. and foreign countries also impacted our effective tax rates and resulted primarily from changes in the geographic distribution of and changes in consumer demand for our products and services. we supply our windows pc operating system to customers through our u.s. regional operating center, while we supply the microsoft office system and our server products and tools to customers through our foreign regional operations centers. windows pc operating system revenue increased $209 million in fiscal year 2013, while microsoft office system and server products and tools revenue increased $696 million and $1.2 billion, respectively, during this same period. in fiscal years 2013 and 2012, our u.s. income before income taxes was $6.7 billion and $1.6 billion, respectively, and comprised 25% and 7%, respectively, of our income before income taxes. in fiscal years 2013 and 2012, the foreign income before income taxes was $20.4 billion and $20.7 billion, respectively, and comprised 75% and 93%, respectively, of our income before income taxes. the primary driver for the increase in the u.s. income before income tax in fiscal year 2013 was the goodwill impairment charge recorded during the prior year.  tax contingencies and other tax liabilities were $9.4 billion and $7.6 billion as of june 30, 2013 and 2012, respectively, and are included in other long-term liabilities. this increase relates primarily to transfer pricing, including transfer pricing developments in certain foreign tax jurisdictions, primarily denmark. while we settled a portion of the i.r.s. audit for tax years 2004 to 2006 during the third quarter of fiscal year 2011, we remain under audit for those years. in february 2012, the i.r.s. withdrew its 2011 revenue agents report and reopened the audit phase of the examination. as of june 30, 2013, the primary unresolved issue relates to transfer pricing which could have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements if not resolved favorably. we do not believe it is reasonably possible that the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits will significantly increase or decrease within the next 12 months because we do not believe the remaining open issues will be resolved within the next 12 months. we also continue to be subject to examination by the i.r.s. for tax years 2007 to 2012.  we are subject to income tax in many jurisdictions outside the u.s. our operations in certain jurisdictions remain subject to examination for tax years 1996 to 2012, some of which are currently under audit by local tax authorities. the resolutions of these audits are not expected to be material to our consolidated financial statements.  financial condition  cash, cash equivalents, and investments  cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments totaled $85.7 billion as of june 30, 2014, compared with $77.0 billion as of june 30, 2013. equity and other investments were $14.6 billion as of june 30, 2014, compared with $10.8 billion as of june 30, 2013. our short-term investments are primarily to facilitate liquidity and for capital preservation. they consist predominantly of highly liquid investment-grade fixed-income securities, diversified among industries and individual issuers. the investments are predominantly u.s. dollar-denominated securities, but also include foreign currency-denominated securities in order to diversify risk. our fixed-income investments are exposed to interest rate risk and credit risk. the credit risk and average maturity of our fixed-income portfolio are    40 



 table of contents    part ii  item 7     managed to achieve economic returns that correlate to certain fixed-income indices. the settlement risk related to these investments is insignificant given that the short-term investments held are primarily highly liquid investment-grade fixed-income securities.  of the cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments at june 30, 2014, $77.1 billion was held by our foreign subsidiaries and would be subject to material repatriation tax effects. the amount of cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments held by foreign subsidiaries subject to other restrictions on the free flow of funds (primarily currency and other local regulatory) was $2.6 billion. as of june 30, 2014, approximately 84% of the cash equivalents and short-term investments held by our foreign subsidiaries were invested in u.s. government and agency securities, approximately 5% were invested in corporate notes and bonds of u.s. companies, and approximately 1% were invested in u.s. mortgage-backed securities, all of which are denominated in u.s. dollars.  securities lending  we lend certain fixed-income and equity securities to increase investment returns. the loaned securities continue to be carried as investments on our balance sheet. cash and/or security interests are received as collateral for the loaned securities with the amount determined based upon the underlying security lent and the creditworthiness of the borrower. cash received is recorded as an asset with a corresponding liability. our securities lending payable balance was $558 million as of june 30, 2014. our average and maximum securities lending payable balances for the fiscal year were $619 million and $1.3 billion, respectively. intra-year variances in the amount of securities loaned are mainly due to fluctuations in the demand for the securities.  valuation  in general, and where applicable, we use quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities to determine the fair value of our financial instruments. this pricing methodology applies to our level 1 investments, such as exchange-traded mutual funds, domestic and international equities, and u.s. government securities. if quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities are not available to determine fair value, then we use quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities or inputs other than the quoted prices that are observable either directly or indirectly. this pricing methodology applies to our level 2 investments such as corporate notes and bonds, common and preferred stock, foreign government bonds, mortgage-backed securities, and certificates of deposit. level 3 investments are valued using internally developed models with unobservable inputs. assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis using unobservable inputs are an immaterial portion of our portfolio.  a majority of our investments are priced by pricing vendors and are generally level 1 or level 2 investments as these vendors either provide a quoted market price in an active market or use observable inputs for their pricing without applying significant adjustments. broker pricing is used mainly when a quoted price is not available, the investment is not priced by our pricing vendors, or when a broker price is more reflective of fair values in the market in which the investment trades. our broker-priced investments are generally classified as level 2 investments because the broker prices these investments based on similar assets without applying significant adjustments. in addition, all of our broker-priced investments have a sufficient level of trading volume to demonstrate that the fair values used are appropriate for these investments. our fair value processes include controls that are designed to ensure appropriate fair values are recorded. these controls include model validation, review of key model inputs, analysis of period-over-period fluctuations, and independent recalculation of prices where appropriate.  cash flows  fiscal year 2014 compared with fiscal year 2013  cash flows from operations increased $3.4 billion during the current fiscal year to $32.2 billion, due mainly to increases in cash received from customers. cash used in financing increased $246 million to $8.4 billion, due mainly to a $2.0 billion increase in cash used for common stock repurchases, a $1.4 billion increase in dividends paid, and a $324 million decrease in proceeds from the issuance of common stock, offset in part by a $3.4 billion increase in    41 



 table of contents    part ii  item 7     proceeds from issuances of debt, net of repayments. cash used in investing decreased $5.0 billion to $18.8 billion, due mainly to a $10.5 billion decrease in cash used for net investment purchases, sales, and maturities, offset in part by a $4.4 billion increase in cash used for acquisition of companies and purchases of intangible and other assets, and a $1.2 billion increase in capital expenditures for property and equipment.  fiscal year 2013 compared with fiscal year 2012  cash flows from operations decreased $2.8 billion during the current fiscal year to $28.8 billion, due mainly to changes in working capital, including increases in inventory and other current assets. cash used for financing decreased $1.3 billion to $8.1 billion, due mainly to a $3.5 billion increase in proceeds from issuances of debt, net of repayments, offset in part by a $1.1 billion increase in dividends paid and a $982 million decrease in proceeds from the issuance of common stock. cash used in investing decreased $975 million to $23.8 billion, due mainly to an $8.5 billion decrease in cash used for acquisitions of companies and purchases of intangible and other assets, offset in part by a $5.8 billion increase in cash used for net investment purchases, maturities, and sales, and a $2.0 billion increase in cash used for additions to property and equipment.  debt  we issued debt to take advantage of favorable pricing and liquidity in the debt markets, reflecting our credit rating and the low interest rate environment. the proceeds of these issuances were or will be used for general corporate purposes, which may include, among other things, funding for working capital, capital expenditures, repurchases of capital stock, acquisitions, and repayment of existing debt.  as of june 30, 2014, we had $22.6 billion of issued and outstanding debt, comprising $2.0 billion of short-term debt and $20.6 billion of long-term debt.  short-term debt  as of june 30, 2014, we had $2.0 billion of commercial paper issued and outstanding, with a weighted-average interest rate of 0.12% and maturities ranging from 86 days to 91 days. the estimated fair value of this commercial paper approximates its carrying value.  we have a $5.0 billion credit facility that expires on november 14, 2018, which serves as a back-up for our commercial paper program. as of june 30, 2014, we were in compliance with the only financial covenant in the credit agreement, which requires us to maintain a coverage ratio of at least three times earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization to interest expense, as defined in the credit agreement. no amounts were drawn against the credit facility during any of the periods presented.  long-term debt  as of june 30, 2014, the total carrying value and estimated fair value of our long-term debt were $20.6 billion and $21.5 billion, respectively. these estimated fair values are based on level 2 inputs.    42

 table of contents    part ii  item 7    contractual obligations  the following table summarizes the payments due by fiscal year for our outstanding contractual obligations as of june 30, 2014:      other planned uses of capital  we will continue to invest in sales, marketing, product support infrastructure, and existing and advanced areas of technology. additions to property and equipment will continue, including new facilities, data centers, and computer systems for research and development, sales and marketing, support, and administrative staff. we expect capital expenditures to increase in coming years in support of our cloud and devices strategy. we have operating leases for most u.s. and international sales and support offices and certain equipment. we have not engaged in any related party transactions or arrangements with unconsolidated entities or other persons that are reasonably likely to materially affect liquidity or the availability of capital resources.  liquidity  we earn a significant amount of our operating income outside the u.s., which is deemed to be permanently reinvested in foreign jurisdictions. as a result, as discussed above under cash, cash equivalents, and investments, the majority of our cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments are held by foreign subsidiaries. we currently do not intend nor foresee a need to repatriate these funds. we expect existing domestic cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, and cash flows from operations to continue to be sufficient to fund our domestic operating activities and cash commitments for investing and financing activities, such as regular quarterly dividends, debt repayment schedules, and material capital expenditures, for at least the next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future. in addition, we expect existing foreign cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, and cash flows from operations to continue to be sufficient to fund our foreign operating activities and cash commitments for investing activities, such as material capital expenditures, for at least the next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future.  should we require more capital in the u.s. than is generated by our operations domestically, for example to fund significant discretionary activities, such as business acquisitions and share repurchases, we could elect to repatriate future earnings from foreign jurisdictions or raise capital in the u.s. through debt or equity issuances. these alternatives could result in higher effective tax rates, increased interest expense, or dilution of our earnings. we have borrowed funds domestically and continue to believe we have the ability to do so at reasonable interest rates.    45 



 table of contents    part ii  item 7    recent accounting guidance  recently adopted accounting guidance  in december 2011, the financial accounting standards board (fasb) issued guidance enhancing disclosure requirements about the nature of an entitys right to offset and related arrangements associated with its financial instruments. the new guidance requires the disclosure of the gross amounts subject to rights of set-off, amounts offset in accordance with the accounting standards followed, and the related net exposure. in january 2013, the fasb clarified that the scope of this guidance applies to derivatives, repurchase agreements, and securities lending arrangements that are either offset or subject to an enforceable master netting arrangement, or similar agreements. we adopted this new guidance beginning july 1, 2013. adoption of this new guidance resulted only in changes to the presentation of note 5  derivatives of the notes to financial statements.  in february 2013, the fasb issued guidance on disclosure requirements for items reclassified out of aoci. this new guidance requires entities to present (either on the face of the income statement or in the notes to financial statements) the effects on the line items of the income statement for amounts reclassified out of aoci. we adopted this new guidance beginning july 1, 2013. adoption of this new guidance resulted only in changes to the presentation of note 19  accumulated other comprehensive income of the notes to financial statements.  recent accounting guidance not yet adopted  in march 2013, the fasb issued guidance on a parents accounting for the cumulative translation adjustment upon derecognition of a subsidiary or group of assets within a foreign entity. this new guidance requires that the parent release any related cumulative translation adjustment into net income only if the sale or transfer results in the complete or substantially complete liquidation of the foreign entity in which the subsidiary or group of assets had resided. the new guidance will be effective for us beginning july 1, 2014. we do not anticipate material impacts on our consolidated financial statements upon adoption.  in may 2014, as part of its ongoing efforts to assist in the convergence of u.s. gaap and international financial reporting standards, the fasb issued a new standard related to revenue recognition. under the new standard, recognition of revenue occurs when a customer obtains control of promised goods or services in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. in addition, the standard requires disclosure of the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. the new standard will be effective for us beginning july 1, 2017 and early adoption is not permitted. we anticipate this standard will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements, and we are currently evaluating its impact.  application of critical accounting policies  our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with u.s. gaap. preparing consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. these estimates and assumptions are affected by managements application of accounting policies. critical accounting policies for us include revenue recognition, impairment of investment securities, goodwill, research and development costs, contingencies, income taxes, and inventories.  revenue recognition  revenue recognition for multiple-element arrangements requires judgment to determine if multiple elements exist, whether elements can be accounted for as separate units of accounting, and if so, the fair value for each of the elements.  judgment is also required to assess whether future releases of certain software represent new products or upgrades and enhancements to existing products. certain volume licensing arrangements include a perpetual license for    46 



 table of contents    part ii  item 7     current products combined with rights to receive unspecified future versions of software products (software assurance) and are accounted for as subscriptions, with billings recorded as unearned revenue and recognized as revenue ratably over the coverage period.  software updates are evaluated on a case-by-case basis to determine whether they meet the definition of an upgrade, which may require revenue to be deferred and recognized when the upgrade is delivered. if it is determined that implied post-contract customer support (pcs) is being provided, revenue from the arrangement is deferred and recognized over the implied pcs term. if updates are determined to not meet the definition of an upgrade, revenue is generally recognized as products are shipped or made available.  microsoft enters into arrangements that can include various combinations of software, services, and hardware. where elements are delivered over different periods of time, and when allowed under u.s. gaap, revenue is allocated to the respective elements based on their relative selling prices at the inception of the arrangement, and revenue is recognized as each element is delivered. we use a hierarchy to determine the fair value to be used for allocating revenue to elements: (i) vendor-specific objective evidence of fair value (vsoe), (ii) third-party evidence, and (iii) best estimate of selling price (esp). for software elements, we follow the industry specific software guidance which only allows for the use of vsoe in establishing fair value. generally, vsoe is the price charged when the deliverable is sold separately or the price established by management for a product that is not yet sold if it is probable that the price will not change before introduction into the marketplace. esps are established as best estimates of what the selling prices would be if the deliverables were sold regularly on a stand-alone basis. our process for determining esps requires judgment and considers multiple factors that may vary over time depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each deliverable.  windows 7 revenue was subject to deferral as a result of the windows upgrade offer, which started june 2, 2012. the offer provided significantly discounted rights to purchase windows 8 pro to qualifying end-users that purchased windows 7 pcs during the eligibility period. microsoft was responsible for delivering windows 8 pro to the end customer. accordingly, revenue related to the allocated discount for undelivered windows 8 was deferred until it was delivered or the redemption period expired.  impairment of investment securities  we review investments quarterly for indicators of other-than-temporary impairment. this determination requires significant judgment. in making this judgment, we employ a systematic methodology quarterly that considers available quantitative and qualitative evidence in evaluating potential impairment of our investments. if the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value, we evaluate, among other factors, general market conditions, credit quality of debt instrument issuers, the duration and extent to which the fair value is less than cost, and for equity securities, our intent and ability to hold, or plans to sell, the investment. for fixed-income securities, we also evaluate whether we have plans to sell the security or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery. we also consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of and business outlook for the investee, including industry and sector performance, changes in technology, and operational and financing cash flow factors. once a decline in fair value is determined to be other-than-temporary, an impairment charge is recorded to other income (expense) and a new cost basis in the investment is established. if market, industry, and/or investee conditions deteriorate, we may incur future impairments.  goodwill  we allocate goodwill to reporting units based on the reporting unit expected to benefit from the business combination. we evaluate our reporting units on an annual basis and, if necessary, reassign goodwill using a relative fair value allocation approach. goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level (operating segment or one level below an operating segment) on an annual basis (may 1 for us) and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. these events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate, legal factors, operating performance indicators, competition, or sale or disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit.    47 



 table of contents    part ii  item 7    application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment, including the identification of reporting units, assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units, assignment of goodwill to reporting units, and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit. the fair value of each reporting unit is estimated primarily through the use of a discounted cash flow methodology. this analysis requires significant judgments, including estimation of future cash flows, which is dependent on internal forecasts, estimation of the long-term rate of growth for our business, estimation of the useful life over which cash flows will occur, and determination of our weighted average cost of capital.  the estimates used to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit change from year to year based on operating results, market conditions, and other factors. changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and goodwill impairment for each reporting unit.  the valuation of acquired assets and liabilities, including goodwill, resulting from the acquisition of nds, is reflective of the enterprise value based on the long-term financial forecast for the business. in this highly competitive and volatile market, it is possible that we may not realize our forecasts. given the value assigned to goodwill in the purchase price allocation, we will closely monitor the performance of the business versus the long-term forecast to determine if any impairments arise.  research and development costs  costs incurred internally in researching and developing a computer software product are charged to expense until technological feasibility has been established for the product. once technological feasibility is established, all software costs are capitalized until the product is available for general release to customers. judgment is required in determining when technological feasibility of a product is established. we have determined that technological feasibility for our software products is reached after all high-risk development issues have been resolved through coding and testing. generally, this occurs shortly before the products are released to manufacturing. the amortization of these costs is included in cost of revenue over the estimated life of the products.  legal and other contingencies  the outcomes of legal proceedings and claims brought against us are subject to significant uncertainty. an estimated loss from a loss contingency such as a legal proceeding or claim is accrued by a charge to income if it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. in determining whether a loss should be accrued we evaluate, among other factors, the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss. changes in these factors could materially impact our consolidated financial statements.  income taxes  the objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entitys financial statements or tax returns. we recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. accounting literature also provides guidance on derecognition of income tax assets and liabilities, classification of current and deferred income tax assets and liabilities, accounting for interest and penalties associated with tax positions, and income tax disclosures. judgment is required in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements or tax returns. variations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could materially impact our consolidated financial statements.  inventories  inventories are stated at average cost, subject to the lower of cost or market. cost includes materials, labor, and manufacturing overhead related to the purchase and production of inventories. we regularly review inventory    48 



 table of contents    part ii  item 7     quantities on hand, future purchase commitments with our suppliers, and the estimated utility of our inventory. these reviews include analysis of demand forecasts, product life cycle status, product development plans, current sales levels, pricing strategy, and component cost trends. if our review indicates a reduction in utility below carrying value, we reduce our inventory to a new cost basis through a charge to cost of revenue. the determination of market value and the estimated volume of demand used in the lower of cost or market analysis require significant judgment.    49 



 table of contents    part ii  item 7    statement of managements responsibility for financial statements  management is responsible for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements and related information that are presented in this report. the consolidated financial statements, which include amounts based on managements estimates and judgments, have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america.  the company designs and maintains accounting and internal control systems to provide reasonable assurance at reasonable cost that assets are safeguarded against loss from unauthorized use or disposition, and that the financial records are reliable for preparing consolidated financial statements and maintaining accountability for assets. these systems are augmented by written policies, an organizational structure providing division of responsibilities, careful selection and training of qualified personnel, and a program of internal audits.  the company engaged deloitte & touche llp, an independent registered public accounting firm, to audit and render an opinion on the consolidated financial statements and internal control over financial reporting in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board (united states).  the board of directors, through its audit committee, consisting solely of independent directors of the company, meets periodically with management, internal auditors, and our independent registered public accounting firm to ensure that each is meeting its responsibilities and to discuss matters concerning internal controls and financial reporting. deloitte & touche llp and the internal auditors each have full and free access to the audit committee.      50 



 table of contents    part ii  item 7a    item 7a. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk  risks  we are exposed to economic risk from foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, credit risk, equity prices, and commodity prices. a portion of these risks is hedged, but they may impact our consolidated financial statements.  foreign currency  certain forecasted transactions, assets, and liabilities are exposed to foreign currency risk. we monitor our foreign currency exposures daily and use hedges where practicable to offset the risks and maximize the economic effectiveness of our foreign currency positions. principal currencies hedged include the euro, japanese yen, british pound, and canadian dollar.  interest rate  our fixed-income portfolio is diversified across credit sectors and maturities, consisting primarily of investment-grade securities. the credit risk and average maturity of the fixed-income portfolio is managed to achieve economic returns that correlate to certain global and domestic fixed-income indices. in addition, we use to be announced forward purchase commitments of mortgage-backed assets to gain exposure to agency and mortgage-backed securities.  equity  our equity portfolio consists of global, developed, and emerging market securities that are subject to market price risk. we manage the securities relative to certain global and domestic indices and expect their economic risk and return to correlate with these indices.  commodity  we use broad-based commodity exposures to enhance portfolio returns and facilitate portfolio diversification. our investment portfolio has exposure to a variety of commodities, including precious metals, energy, and grain. we manage these exposures relative to global commodity indices and expect their economic risk and return to correlate with these indices.  value-at-risk  we use a value-at-risk (var) model to estimate and quantify our market risks. var is the expected loss, for a given confidence level, in the fair value of our portfolio due to adverse market movements over a defined time horizon. the var model is not intended to represent actual losses in fair value, including determinations of other-than-temporary losses in fair value in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states (u.s. gaap), but is used as a risk estimation and management tool. the distribution of the potential changes in total market value of all holdings is computed based on the historical volatilities and correlations among foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, equity prices, and commodity prices, assuming normal market conditions.  the var is calculated as the total loss that will not be exceeded at the 97.5 percentile confidence level or, alternatively stated, the losses could exceed the var in 25 out of 1,000 cases. several risk factors are not captured in the model, including liquidity risk, operational risk, and legal risk.    51

 table of contents    part ii  item 8    notes to financial statements  note 1 - accounting policies  accounting principles  the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america (u.s. gaap).  principles of consolidation  the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of microsoft corporation and its subsidiaries. intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated. equity investments through which we are able to exercise significant influence over but do not control the investee and are not the primary beneficiary of the investees activities are accounted for using the equity method. investments through which we are not able to exercise significant influence over the investee and which do not have readily determinable fair values are accounted for under the cost method.  estimates and assumptions  preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. examples of estimates include: loss contingencies; product warranties; the fair value of, and/or potential goodwill impairment for, our reporting units; product life cycles; useful lives of our tangible and intangible assets; allowances for doubtful accounts; allowances for product returns; the market value of our inventory; and stock-based compensation forfeiture rates. examples of assumptions include: the elements comprising a software arrangement, including the distinction between upgrades or enhancements and new products; when technological feasibility is achieved for our products; the potential outcome of future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements or tax returns; and determining when investment impairments are other-than-temporary. actual results and outcomes may differ from managements estimates and assumptions.  recasting of certain prior period information  during the first quarter of fiscal year 2014, we changed our organizational structure as part of our transformation to a devices and services company. as a result, information that our chief operating decision maker regularly reviews for purposes of allocating resources and assessing performance changed. therefore, beginning in fiscal year 2014, we reported our financial performance based on our new segments described in note 21  segment information and geographic data. we have recast certain prior period amounts to conform to the way we internally managed and monitored segment performance during fiscal year 2014. this change impacted note 10  goodwill, note 14  unearned revenue, and note 21  segment information and geographic data, with no impact on our consolidated financial statements.  foreign currencies  assets and liabilities recorded in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rate on the balance sheet date. revenue and expenses are translated at average rates of exchange prevailing during the year. translation adjustments resulting from this process are recorded to other comprehensive income (oci).  revenue recognition  revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the fee is fixed or determinable, and collectability is probable. revenue generally is recognized net of allowances for returns and any taxes collected from customers and subsequently remitted to governmental authorities.    58 



 table of contents    part ii  item 8    revenue recognition for multiple-element arrangements requires judgment to determine if multiple elements exist, whether elements can be accounted for as separate units of accounting, and if so, the fair value for each of the elements.  microsoft enters into arrangements that can include various combinations of software, services, and hardware. where elements are delivered over different periods of time, and when allowed under u.s. gaap, revenue is allocated to the respective elements based on their relative selling prices at the inception of the arrangement, and revenue is recognized as each element is delivered. we use a hierarchy to determine the fair value to be used for allocating revenue to elements: (i) vendor-specific objective evidence of fair value (vsoe), (ii) third-party evidence, and (iii) best estimate of selling price (esp). for software elements, we follow the industry specific software guidance which only allows for the use of vsoe in establishing fair value. generally, vsoe is the price charged when the deliverable is sold separately or the price established by management for a product that is not yet sold if it is probable that the price will not change before introduction into the marketplace. esps are established as best estimates of what the selling prices would be if the deliverables were sold regularly on a stand-alone basis. our process for determining esps requires judgment and considers multiple factors that may vary over time depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each deliverable.  revenue for retail packaged products, products licensed to original equipment manufacturers (oems), and perpetual licenses under certain volume licensing programs generally is recognized as products are shipped or made available.  technology guarantee programs are accounted for as multiple-element arrangements as customers receive free or significantly discounted rights to use upcoming new versions of a software product if they license existing versions of the product during the eligibility period. revenue is allocated between the existing product and the new product, and revenue allocated to the new product is deferred until that version is delivered. the revenue allocation is based on the vsoe of fair value of the products. the vsoe of fair value for upcoming new products are based on the price determined by management having the relevant authority when the element is not yet sold separately, but is expected to be sold in the near future at the price set by management.  software updates that will be provided free of charge are evaluated on a case-by-case basis to determine whether they meet the definition of an upgrade and create a multiple-element arrangement, which may require revenue to be deferred and recognized when the upgrade is delivered, or if it is determined that implied post-contract customer support (pcs) is being provided, the arrangement is accounted for as a multiple-element arrangement and all revenue from the arrangement is deferred and recognized over the implied pcs term when the vsoe of fair value does not exist. if updates are determined to not meet the definition of an upgrade, revenue is generally recognized as products are shipped or made available.  certain volume licensing arrangements include a perpetual license for current products combined with rights to receive unspecified future versions of software products (software assurance), which we have determined are additional software products and are therefore accounted for as subscriptions, with billings recorded as unearned revenue and recognized as revenue ratably over the coverage period. arrangements that include term-based licenses for current products with the right to use unspecified future versions of the software during the coverage period, are also accounted for as subscriptions, with revenue recognized ratably over the coverage period.  revenue from cloud-based services arrangements that allow for the use of a hosted software product or service over a contractually determined period of time without taking possession of software are accounted for as subscriptions with billings recorded as unearned revenue and recognized as revenue ratably over the coverage period beginning on the date the service is made available to customers. revenue from cloud-based services arrangements that are provided on a consumption basis (for example, the amount of storage used in a particular period) is recognized commensurate with the customer utilization of such resources.  some volume licensing arrangements include time-based subscriptions for cloud-based services and software offerings that are accounted for as subscriptions. these arrangements are considered multiple-element arrangements. however, because all elements are accounted for as subscriptions and have the same coverage period and delivery pattern, they have the same revenue recognition timing.    59 



 table of contents    part ii  item 8    revenue related to phones, surface, xbox consoles, games published by us, and other hardware components is generally recognized when ownership is transferred to the resellers or to end customers when selling directly through microsoft retail stores and online marketplaces. a portion of revenue may be deferred when these products are combined with software elements, and/or services. revenue related to licensing for games published by third parties for use on the xbox consoles is recognized when games are manufactured by the game publishers.  display advertising revenue is recognized as advertisements are displayed. search advertising revenue is recognized when the ad appears in the search results or when the action necessary to earn the revenue has been completed. consulting services revenue is recognized as services are rendered, generally based on the negotiated hourly rate in the consulting arrangement and the number of hours worked during the period. consulting revenue for fixed-price services arrangements is recognized as services are provided. revenue from prepaid points redeemable for the purchase of software or services is recognized upon redemption of the points and delivery of the software or services.  cost of revenue  cost of revenue includes: manufacturing and distribution costs for products sold and programs licensed; operating costs related to product support service centers and product distribution centers; costs incurred to include software on pcs sold by oems, to drive traffic to our websites, and to acquire online advertising space (traffic acquisition costs); costs incurred to support and maintain internet-based products and services, including datacenter costs and royalties; warranty costs; inventory valuation adjustments; costs associated with the delivery of consulting services; and the amortization of capitalized research and development costs. capitalized research and development costs are amortized over the estimated lives of the products.  product warranty  we provide for the estimated costs of fulfilling our obligations under hardware and software warranties at the time the related revenue is recognized. for hardware warranties, we estimate the costs based on historical and projected product failure rates, historical and projected repair costs, and knowledge of specific product failures (if any). the specific hardware warranty terms and conditions vary depending upon the product sold and the country in which we do business, but generally include parts and labor over a period generally ranging from 90 days to three years. for software warranties, we estimate the costs to provide bug fixes, such as security patches, over the estimated life of the software. we regularly reevaluate our estimates to assess the adequacy of the recorded warranty liabilities and adjust the amounts as necessary.  research and development  research and development expenses include payroll, employee benefits, stock-based compensation expense, and other headcount-related expenses associated with product development. research and development expenses also include third-party development and programming costs, localization costs incurred to translate software for international markets, and the amortization of purchased software code and services content. such costs related to software development are included in research and development expense until the point that technological feasibility is reached, which for our software products, is generally shortly before the products are released to manufacturing. once technological feasibility is reached, such costs are capitalized and amortized to cost of revenue over the estimated lives of the products.  sales and marketing  sales and marketing expenses include payroll, employee benefits, stock-based compensation expense, and other headcount-related expenses associated with sales and marketing personnel, and the costs of advertising, promotions, trade shows, seminars, and other programs. advertising costs are expensed as incurred. advertising expense was $2.3 billion, $2.6 billion, and $1.6 billion in fiscal years 2014, 2013, and 2012, respectively.    60 



 table of contents    part ii  item 8    stock-based compensation  we measure stock-based compensation cost at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and recognize it as expense, net of estimated forfeitures, over the vesting or service period, as applicable, of the stock award (generally four to five years) using the straight-line method.  employee stock purchase plan  shares of our common stock may be purchased by employees at three-month intervals at 90% of the fair market value of the stock on the last day of each three-month period. compensation expense for the employee stock purchase plan is measured as the discount the employee is entitled to upon purchase and is recognized in the period of purchase.  income taxes  income tax expense includes u.s. and international income taxes, the provision for u.s. taxes on undistributed earnings of international subsidiaries not deemed to be permanently invested, and interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions. certain income and expenses are not reported in tax returns and financial statements in the same year. the tax effect of such temporary differences is reported as deferred income taxes. deferred tax assets are reported net of a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized. the deferred income taxes are classified as current or long-term based on the classification of the related asset or liability.  fair value measurements  we account for certain assets and liabilities at fair value. the hierarchy below lists three levels of fair value based on the extent to which inputs used in measuring fair value are observable in the market. we categorize each of our fair value measurements in one of these three levels based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. these levels are:        we measure certain assets, including our cost and equity method investments, at fair value on a nonrecurring basis when they are deemed to be other-than-temporarily impaired. the fair values of these investments are determined    61 



 table of contents    part ii  item 8     based on valuation techniques using the best information available, and may include quoted market prices, market comparables, and discounted cash flow projections. an impairment charge is recorded when the cost of the investment exceeds its fair value and this condition is determined to be other-than-temporary.  our other current financial assets and our current financial liabilities have fair values that approximate their carrying values.  financial instruments  we consider all highly liquid interest-earning investments with a maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase to be cash equivalents. the fair values of these investments approximate their carrying values. in general, investments with original maturities of greater than three months and remaining maturities of less than one year are classified as short-term investments. investments with maturities beyond one year may be classified as short-term based on their highly liquid nature and because such marketable securities represent the investment of cash that is available for current operations. all cash equivalents and short-term investments are classified as available-for-sale and realized gains and losses are recorded using the specific identification method. changes in market value, excluding other-than-temporary impairments, are reflected in oci.  equity and other investments classified as long-term include both debt and equity instruments. with the exception of certain corporate notes that are classified as held-to-maturity, debt and publicly-traded equity securities are classified as available-for-sale and realized gains and losses are recorded using the specific identification method. changes in the market value of available-for-sale securities, excluding other-than-temporary impairments, are reflected in oci. held-to-maturity investments are recorded and held at amortized cost. common and preferred stock and other investments that are restricted for more than one year or are not publicly traded are recorded at cost or using the equity method.  we lend certain fixed-income and equity securities to increase investment returns. the loaned securities continue to be carried as investments on our balance sheet. cash and/or security interests are received as collateral for the loaned securities with the amount determined based upon the underlying security lent and the creditworthiness of the borrower. cash received is recorded as an asset with a corresponding liability.  investments are considered to be impaired when a decline in fair value is judged to be other-than-temporary. fair value is calculated based on publicly available market information or other estimates determined by management. we employ a systematic methodology on a quarterly basis that considers available quantitative and qualitative evidence in evaluating potential impairment of our investments. if the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value, we evaluate, among other factors, general market conditions, credit quality of debt instrument issuers, the duration and extent to which the fair value is less than cost, and for equity securities, our intent and ability to hold, or plans to sell, the investment. for fixed-income securities, we also evaluate whether we have plans to sell the security or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery. we also consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of and business outlook for the investee, including industry and sector performance, changes in technology, and operational and financing cash flow factors. once a decline in fair value is determined to be other-than-temporary, an impairment charge is recorded to other income (expense) and a new cost basis in the investment is established.  derivative instruments are recognized as either assets or liabilities and are measured at fair value. the accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation.  for derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges, the gains (losses) are recognized in earnings in the periods of change together with the offsetting losses (gains) on the hedged items attributed to the risk being hedged. for options designated as fair value hedges, changes in the time value are excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and are recognized in earnings.  for derivative instruments designated as cash-flow hedges, the effective portion of the gains (losses) on the derivatives is initially reported as a component of oci and is subsequently recognized in earnings when the hedged    62

 table of contents    part ii  item 8    recent accounting guidance  recently adopted accounting guidance  in december 2011, the financial accounting standards board (fasb) issued guidance enhancing disclosure requirements about the nature of an entitys right to offset and related arrangements associated with its financial instruments. the new guidance requires the disclosure of the gross amounts subject to rights of set-off, amounts offset in accordance with the accounting standards followed, and the related net exposure. in january 2013, the fasb clarified that the scope of this guidance applies to derivatives, repurchase agreements, and securities lending arrangements that are either offset or subject to an enforceable master netting arrangement, or similar agreements. we adopted this new guidance beginning july 1, 2013. adoption of this new guidance resulted only in changes to the presentation of note 5  derivatives.  in february 2013, the fasb issued guidance on disclosure requirements for items reclassified out of aoci. this new guidance requires entities to present (either on the face of the income statement or in the notes to financial statements) the effects on the line items of the income statement for amounts reclassified out of aoci. we adopted this new guidance beginning july 1, 2013. adoption of this new guidance resulted only in changes to the presentation of note 19  accumulated other comprehensive income.  recent accounting guidance not yet adopted  in march 2013, the fasb issued guidance on a parents accounting for the cumulative translation adjustment upon derecognition of a subsidiary or group of assets within a foreign entity. this new guidance requires that the parent release any related cumulative translation adjustment into net income only if the sale or transfer results in the complete or substantially complete liquidation of the foreign entity in which the subsidiary or group of assets had resided. the new guidance will be effective for us beginning july 1, 2014. we do not anticipate material impacts on our consolidated financial statements upon adoption.  in may 2014, as part of its ongoing efforts to assist in the convergence of u.s. gaap and international financial reporting standards, the fasb issued a new standard related to revenue recognition. under the new standard, recognition of revenue occurs when a customer obtains control of promised goods or services in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. in addition, the standard requires disclosure of the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. the new standard will be effective for us beginning july 1, 2017 and early adoption is not permitted. we anticipate this standard will have a material impact, and we are currently evaluating the impact this standard will have on our consolidated financial statements.  note 2 - earnings per share  basic earnings per share (eps) is computed based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. diluted eps is computed based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock plus the effect of dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period using the treasury stock method. dilutive potential common shares include outstanding stock options and stock awards.    64

 table of contents    part ii  item 8    unrealized losses on investments  investments, excluding those held-to-maturity, with continuous unrealized losses for less than 12 months and 12 months or greater and their related fair values were as follows:      as of june 30, 2014, we did not hold any held-to-maturity investments that are in an unrealized loss position.  unrealized losses from fixed-income securities are primarily attributable to changes in interest rates. unrealized losses from domestic and international equities are due to market price movements. management does not believe any remaining unrealized losses represent other-than-temporary impairments based on our evaluation of available evidence as of june 30, 2014.  debt investment maturities        67 



 table of contents    part ii  item 8    note 5 - derivatives  we use derivative instruments to manage risks related to foreign currencies, equity prices, interest rates, and credit; to enhance investment returns; and to facilitate portfolio diversification. our objectives for holding derivatives include reducing, eliminating, and efficiently managing the economic impact of these exposures as effectively as possible. our derivative programs include strategies that both qualify and do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment. all notional amounts presented below are measured in u.s. dollar equivalents.  foreign currency  certain forecasted transactions, assets, and liabilities are exposed to foreign currency risk. we monitor our foreign currency exposures daily to maximize the economic effectiveness of our foreign currency hedge positions. option and forward contracts are used to hedge a portion of forecasted international revenue for up to three years in the future and are designated as cash flow hedging instruments. principal currencies hedged include the euro, japanese yen, british pound, and canadian dollar. as of june 30, 2014 and june 30, 2013, the total notional amounts of these foreign exchange contracts sold were $4.9 billion and $5.1 billion, respectively.  foreign currency risks related to certain non-u.s. dollar denominated securities are hedged using foreign exchange forward contracts that are designated as fair value hedging instruments. as of june 30, 2014 and june 30, 2013, the total notional amounts of these foreign exchange contracts sold were $3.1 billion and $407 million, respectively.  certain options and forwards not designated as hedging instruments are also used to manage the variability in exchange rates on accounts receivable, cash, and intercompany positions, and to manage other foreign currency exposures. as of june 30, 2014, the total notional amounts of these foreign exchange contracts purchased and sold were $6.2 billion and $8.5 billion, respectively. as of june 30, 2013, the total notional amounts of these foreign exchange contracts purchased and sold were $5.0 billion and $7.9 billion, respectively.  equity  securities held in our equity and other investments portfolio are subject to market price risk. market price risk is managed relative to broad-based global and domestic equity indices using certain convertible preferred investments, options, futures, and swap contracts not designated as hedging instruments. from time to time, to hedge our price risk, we may use and designate equity derivatives as hedging instruments, including puts, calls, swaps, and forwards. as of june 30, 2014, the total notional amounts of equity contracts purchased and sold for managing market price risk were $3.1 billion and $2.1 billion, respectively, of which $362 million and $420 million, respectively, were designated as hedging instruments. as of june 30, 2013, the total notional amounts of equity contracts purchased and sold for managing market price risk were $898 million and $1.0 billion, respectively, none of which were designated as hedging instruments.  interest rate  securities held in our fixed-income portfolio are subject to different interest rate risks based on their maturities. we manage the average maturity of our fixed-income portfolio to achieve economic returns that correlate to certain broad-based fixed-income indices using exchange-traded option and futures contracts and over-the-counter swap and option contracts, none of which are designated as hedging instruments. as of june 30, 2014, the total notional amounts of fixed-interest rate contracts purchased and sold were $503 million and $741 million, respectively. as of june 30, 2013, the total notional amounts of fixed-interest rate contracts purchased and sold were $1.1 billion and $809 million, respectively.  in addition, we use to be announced forward purchase commitments of mortgage-backed assets to gain exposure to agency mortgage-backed securities. these meet the definition of a derivative instrument in cases where physical delivery of the assets is not taken at the earliest available delivery date. as of june 30, 2014 and 2013, the total notional derivative amounts of mortgage contracts purchased were $1.1 billion and $1.2 billion, respectively.    68 



 table of contents    part ii  item 8    credit  our fixed-income portfolio is diversified and consists primarily of investment-grade securities. we use credit default swap contracts, not designated as hedging instruments, to manage credit exposures relative to broad-based indices and to facilitate portfolio diversification. we use credit default swaps as they are a low cost method of managing exposure to individual credit risks or groups of credit risks. as of june 30, 2014, the total notional amounts of credit contracts purchased and sold were $412 million and $440 million, respectively. as of june 30, 2013, the total notional amounts of credit contracts purchased and sold were $377 million and $501 million, respectively.  commodity  we use broad-based commodity exposures to enhance portfolio returns and to facilitate portfolio diversification. we use swaps, futures, and option contracts, not designated as hedging instruments, to generate and manage exposures to broad-based commodity indices. we use derivatives on commodities as they can be low-cost alternatives to the purchase and storage of a variety of commodities, including, but not limited to, precious metals, energy, and grain. as of june 30, 2014, the total notional amounts of commodity contracts purchased and sold were $1.4 billion and $408 million, respectively. as of june 30, 2013, the total notional amounts of commodity contracts purchased and sold were $1.2 billion and $249 million, respectively.  credit-risk-related contingent features  certain of our counterparty agreements for derivative instruments contain provisions that require our issued and outstanding long-term unsecured debt to maintain an investment grade credit rating and require us to maintain minimum liquidity of $1.0 billion. to the extent we fail to meet these requirements, we will be required to post collateral, similar to the standard convention related to over-the-counter derivatives. as of june 30, 2014, our long-term unsecured debt rating was aaa, and cash investments were in excess of $1.0 billion. as a result, no collateral was required to be posted.    69

 table of contents    part ii  item 8     puerto rico. our foreign earnings, which are taxed at rates lower than the u.s. rate and are generated from our regional operating centers, were 81%, 79%, and 79% of our foreign income before tax in fiscal years 2014, 2013, and 2012, respectively. in general, other reconciling items consist of interest, adjustments for intercompany transfer pricing, u.s. state income taxes, domestic production deductions, and credits. in fiscal years 2014, 2013, and 2012, there were no individually significant other reconciling items.  the components of the deferred income tax assets and liabilities were as follows:    as of june 30, 2014, we had net operating loss carryforwards of $3.6 billion, including $2.2 billion of foreign net operating loss carryforwards acquired through our acquisition of skype, and $545 million through our acquisition of nds. the valuation allowance disclosed in the table above relates to the foreign net operating loss carryforwards and other net deferred tax assets that may not be realized.  deferred income tax balances reflect the effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases and are stated at enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when the taxes are actually paid or recovered.  as of june 30, 2014, we have not provided deferred u.s. income taxes or foreign withholding taxes on temporary differences of approximately $92.9 billion resulting from earnings for certain non-u.s. subsidiaries which are permanently reinvested outside the u.s. the unrecognized deferred tax liability associated with these temporary differences was approximately $29.6 billion at june 30, 2014.  income taxes paid were $5.5 billion, $3.9 billion, and $3.5 billion in fiscal years 2014, 2013, and 2012, respectively.    81

 table of contents    part ii  item 8    note 15 - other long-term liabilities    note 16 - commitments and guarantees  construction and operating leases  we have committed $880 million for constructing new buildings, building improvements, and leasehold improvements as of june 30, 2014.  we have operating leases for most u.s. and international sales and support offices, research and development facilities, manufacturing facilities, and certain equipment. rental expense for facilities operating leases was $874 million, $711 million, and $639 million, in fiscal years 2014, 2013, and 2012, respectively. future minimum rental commitments under non-cancellable facilities operating leases in place as of june 30, 2014 are as follows:    indemnifications  we provide indemnifications of varying scope and size to certain customers against claims of intellectual property infringement made by third parties arising from the use of our products and certain other matters. we evaluate estimated losses for these indemnifications, and we consider such factors as the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss. to date, we have not encountered significant costs as a result of these obligations and have not accrued any liabilities related to these indemnifications in our consolidated financial statements.  note 17 - contingencies  antitrust, unfair competition, and overcharge class actions  a large number of antitrust and unfair competition class action lawsuits were filed against us in various state, federal, and canadian courts on behalf of various classes of direct and indirect purchasers of our pc operating system and certain other software products between 1999 and 2005.  we obtained dismissals or reached settlements of all claims made in the united states. under the settlements, generally class members can obtain vouchers that entitle them to be reimbursed for purchases of a wide variety of platform-neutral computer hardware and software. the total value of vouchers that we may issue varies by state. we will make available to certain schools a percentage of those vouchers that are not issued or claimed (one-half to two-   83 



 table of contents    part ii  item 8     thirds depending on the state). the total value of vouchers we ultimately issue will depend on the number of class members who make claims and are issued vouchers. we estimate the total remaining cost of the settlements is approximately $400 million, all of which had been accrued as of june 30, 2014.  three similar cases pending in british columbia, ontario, and quebec, canada have not been settled. in march 2010, the court in the british columbia case certified it as a class action. the plaintiffs successfully appealed a british columbia court of appeal decision reversing class certification and dismissing the case. in october 2013, the canadian supreme court reversed the appellate court and reinstated part of the british columbia case, which is now scheduled for trial in september 2015. the other two cases were inactive pending action by the supreme court on the british columbia case.  other antitrust litigation and claims  novell litigation  in november 2004, novell, inc. (novell) filed a complaint in u.s. district court for the district of utah (later transferred to federal court in maryland), asserting antitrust and unfair competition claims against us related to novells ownership of wordperfect and other productivity applications during the period between june 1994 and march 1996. after the trial court dismissed or granted summary judgment on a number of novells claims, trial of the one remaining claim took place in late 2011 and resulted in a mistrial. in july 2012, the trial court granted microsofts motion for judgment as a matter of law. novell appealed this decision to the u.s. court of appeals for the tenth circuit, which affirmed the trial courts decision in september 2013. the supreme court denied novells petition for review in april 2014.  go computer litigation  in june 2005, go computer inc. and co-founder jerry kaplan filed a complaint in california state court asserting antitrust claims under the cartwright act related to the business of the former go corporation in the early 1990s and its successor in interest, lucent corporation in the early 2000s. all claims prior to june 2001 have been dismissed with prejudice as barred by the statute of limitations. after a mini-trial on standing issues, the case is now moving forward with discovery, and a trial is set for september 2015.  china state administration for industry and commerce investigation  on july 28, 2014, microsoft was informed that chinas state administration for industry and commerce (saic) had begun a formal investigation relating to chinas anti-monopoly law, and the saic conducted onsite inspections of microsoft offices in beijing, shanghai, guangzhou, and chengdu. saic has stated the investigation relates to compatibility, bundle sales, and file verification issues related to windows and office software.  patent and intellectual property claims  motorola litigation  in october 2010, microsoft filed patent infringement complaints against motorola mobility (motorola) with the international trade commission (itc) and in u.s. district court in seattle for infringement of nine microsoft patents by motorolas android devices. since then, microsoft and motorola have filed additional claims against each other with the itc, in federal district courts in seattle, wisconsin, florida, and california, and in courts in germany and the united kingdom. the nature of the claims asserted and status of individual matters are summarized below.  international trade commission  in may 2012, the itc issued a limited exclusion order against motorola on one microsoft patent, which became effective in july 2012 and was affirmed on appeal in december 2013. in july 2013, microsoft filed an action in u.s. district court in washington, d.c. seeking an order to compel enforcement of the itcs may 2012 import ban against infringing motorola products by the bureau of customs and border protection (cbp), after learning that cbp had failed to fully enforce the order.    84 



 table of contents    part ii  item 8    in november 2010, motorola filed an action against microsoft with the itc alleging infringement of five motorola patents by xbox consoles and accessories and seeking an exclusion order to prohibit importation of the allegedly infringing xbox products. at motorolas request, the itc terminated its investigation of four motorola patents. in march 2013, the itc affirmed there was no violation of the remaining motorola patent. motorola appealed the itcs decision to the u.s. court of appeals for the federal circuit.  u.s. district court  the seattle district court case filed in october 2010 by microsoft as a companion to microsofts itc case against motorola was stayed pending the outcome of the itc case.  in november 2010, microsoft sued motorola for breach of contract in u.s. district court in seattle, alleging that motorola breached its commitments to standards-setting organizations to license to microsoft certain patents on reasonable and non-discriminatory (rand) terms and conditions. motorola has declared these patents essential to the implementation of the h.264 video standard and the 802.11 wi-fi standard. in the motorola itc case described above and in suits described below, motorola or a motorola affiliate subsequently sued microsoft on those patents in u.s. district courts, in the itc, and in germany. in february 2012, the seattle district court granted a partial summary judgment in favor of microsoft ruling that (1) motorola had committed to standards organizations to license its declared-essential patents on rand terms and conditions; and (2) microsoft is a third-party beneficiary of those commitments. after trial, the seattle district court set per unit royalties for motorolas h.264 and 802.11 patents, which resulted in an immaterial microsoft liability. in september 2013, following trial of microsofts breach of contract claim, a jury awarded $14.5 million in damages to microsoft. motorola appealed.  cases filed by motorola in wisconsin, california, and florida, with the exception of one currently stayed case in wisconsin (a companion case to motorolas itc action), have been transferred to the u.s district court in seattle. motorola and microsoft both seek damages as well as injunctive relief. the court has stayed these cases on agreement of the parties.        germany  in july 2011, motorola filed patent infringement actions in germany against microsoft and several microsoft subsidiaries.            85 



 table of contents    part ii  item 8    in lawsuits microsoft filed in germany in 2011 and 2012, microsoft asserts that motorola android devices infringe microsoft patents and is seeking damages and injunctions. in 2012, regional courts in germany issued injunctions on three of the microsoft patents, which motorola appealed. one judgment has been affirmed on appeal (and motorola has further appealed), and the other two appeals are pending. in actions filed separately by motorola to invalidate these patents, the federal patent court in 2013 and 2014 held the microsoft patents invalid, and microsoft appealed. for the cases in which microsoft obtained injunctions, if motorola were to prevail following all appeals, motorola could have a claim against microsoft for damages caused by an erroneously granted injunction.  united kingdom  in december 2011, microsoft filed an action against motorola in the high court of justice, chancery division, patents court, in london, england, seeking to revoke the uk part of the european patent asserted by motorola in germany against the activesync protocol. in february 2012, motorola counterclaimed alleging infringement of the patent and seeking damages and an injunction. in december 2012, the court ruled that motorolas patent is invalid. the court also ruled that the patent, even if valid, would be licensed under the grant-back clause in googles activesync license. motorola appealed and the appeals court affirmed the lower courts ruling in microsofts favor in november 2013. motorola has exhausted all appeals and the rulings in microsofts favor are final.  ipcom patent litigation  ipcom gmbh & co. is a german company that holds a large portfolio of mobile technology related patents spanning about 170 patent families and addressing a broad range of cellular technologies. ipcom has asserted 19 of these patents in litigation against nokia and many of the leading cell phone companies and operators. three of the infringement suits against nokia (now assumed by microsoft through the nds acquisition) are still pending in courts in germany, england, and italy. these courts have held a number of ipcoms patents were invalid or not infringed. we continue to contest the validity or infringement of the patents remaining in dispute.  interdigital patent litigation  interdigital technology corporation and interdigital communications corporation (collectively, idt) filed four patent infringement cases against nokia in the itc and in u.s. district court for the district of delaware between 2007 and 2013. we are being substituted for nokia in these cases. each case includes other co-defendants because most of the patents at issue allegedly relate to 3g and 4g wireless communications standards essential functionality. the suite of cases include three itc investigations where idt is seeking an order excluding importation of 3g and 4g phones into the u.s. and one active case in u.s. district court in delaware seeking an injunction and damages.  european copyright levies  we have assumed from nokia all potential liability due to nokias alleged failure to pay private copying levies in various european countries based upon sale of memory cards and mobile phones that incorporate blank memory. the levies are based upon a 2001 eu directive establishing a right for end users to make copies of copyrighted works for personal or private use, but also allowing the collection of levies based upon sales of blank media or recording devices to compensate copyright holders for private copying. various collecting societies in eu countries initiated litigation against nokia, stating that nokia must pay levies not only based upon sales of blank memory cards, but also phones that include blank memory for data storage on the phones, regardless of actual usage of that memory. the most significant cases against nokia are pending in germany and austria, due to both high volume of sales and high levy amounts sought in these countries. we are litigating against certain collecting societies on the basis that the levy schemes exceed what the eu directive and european court of justice decisions permit.  other patent and intellectual property claims  in addition to these cases, there are approximately 90 other patent infringement cases pending against microsoft.    86

 table of contents    part ii  item 8    product-related litigation  u.s. cell phone litigation  nokia, along with other handset manufacturers and network operators, is a defendant in 19 lawsuits filed in the superior court for the district of columbia by individual plaintiffs who allege that radio emissions from cellular handsets caused their brain tumors and other adverse health effects. we have assumed responsibility for these claims as part of the nds acquisition. nine of these cases were filed in 2002 and are consolidated for certain pre-trial proceedings; the remaining ten cases are stayed. in a separate 2009 decision, the court of appeals for the district of columbia held that adverse health effect claims arising from the use of cellular handsets that operate within the u.s. federal communications commission radio frequency emission guidelines (fcc guidelines) are pre-empted by federal law. the plaintiffs allege that their handsets either operated outside the fcc guidelines or were manufactured before the fcc guidelines went into effect. the lawsuits also allege an industry-wide conspiracy to manipulate the science and testing around emission guidelines. in september 2013, defendants in the consolidated cases moved to exclude plaintiffs expert evidence of general causation on the basis of flawed scientific methodologies. the motion was heard in december 2013 and january 2014. in march 2014, defendants filed a separate motion to preclude plaintiffs general causation testimony on the ground that it is pre-empted by federal law because the experts challenge the safety of all cellular handsets, including those that comply with the fcc guidelines. both motions are pending.  canadian cell phone class action  nokia, along with other handset manufacturers and network operators, is a defendant in a 2013 class action lawsuit filed in the supreme court of british columbia by a purported class of canadians who have used cellular phones for at least 1600 hours, including a subclass of users with brain tumors. microsoft was served with the complaint in june 2014. the litigation is not yet active as several defendants remain to be served.  other  we also are subject to a variety of other claims and suits that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of our business. although management currently believes that resolving claims against us, individually or in aggregate, will not have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements, these matters are subject to inherent uncertainties and managements view of these matters may change in the future.  as of june 30, 2014, we had accrued aggregate liabilities of $780 million in other current liabilities and $81 million in other long-term liabilities for all of our legal matters that were contingencies as of that date. while we intend to defend these matters vigorously, adverse outcomes that we estimate could reach approximately $2.0 billion in aggregate beyond recorded amounts are reasonably possible. were unfavorable final outcomes to occur, there exists the possibility of a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements for the period in which the effects become reasonably estimable. substantially all changes from the prior quarter in these accruals and estimates are attributable to matters involving nokia that we assumed as a result of the nds acquisition.  note 18 - stockholders equity  shares outstanding  shares of common stock outstanding were as follows:      87
