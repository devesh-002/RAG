seq.=1,folio='20',file='c:\jms\skumar\06-25759-2\task1586490\25759-2-de.htm',user='105032',cd='dec 29 04:51 2006'certain prior periods. as a result, the company has
recorded additional non-cash stock-based compensation expense, and related tax
effects, with regard to certain past stock option grants, and the company has restated
certain previously filed financial statements included in this form 10-k.the internal review, the independent investigation,
and related activities have required the company to incur substantial expenses
for legal, accounting, tax and other professional services, have diverted
managements attention from the companys business, and could in the future harm
its business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.while the company believes it has made appropriate
judgments in determining the correct measurement dates for its stock option
grants, the sec may disagree with the manner in which the company has accounted
for and reported, or not reported, the financial impact. accordingly, there is
a risk the company may have to further restate its prior financial statements,
amend prior filings with the sec, or take other actions not currently
contemplated.the companys past stock option granting practices and
the restatement of prior financial statements have exposed the company to
greater risks associated with litigation, regulatory proceedings and government
enforcement actions. as described in part i, item 3, legal proceedings,
several derivative complaints and a class action complaint have been filed in
state and federal courts against the companys directors and certain of its
executive officers pertaining to allegations relating to stock option grants.
the company has provided the results of its internal review and independent
investigation to the sec and the united states attorneys office for the
northern district of california, and in that regard the company has responded
to informal requests for documents and additional information. the company
intends to continue full cooperation. no assurance can be given regarding the
outcomes from litigation, regulatory proceedings or government enforcement
actions relating to the companys past stock option practices. the resolution
of these matters will be time consuming, expensive, and will distract
management from the conduct of the companys business. furthermore, if the
company is subject to adverse findings in litigation, regulatory proceedings or
government enforcement actions, the company could be required to pay damages or
penalties or have other remedies imposed, which could harm its business,
financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.in august 2006, the
company received a nasdaq staff determination letter stating that, as a result
of the delayed filing of the companys form 10-q for the quarter
ended july 1, 2006 (the third quarter form 10-q), the company
was not in compliance with the filing requirements for continued listing as set
forth in marketplace rule 4310(c)(14) and was therefore subject to
delisting from the nasdaq stock market. on october 24, 2006, the
nasdaq listing qualifications panel granted the companys request for continued
listing, subject to the company filing the third quarter form 10-q,
and any required restatements, with the sec by december 29, 2006. on december 29,
2006, the company filed the third quarter form 10-q with the sec. with
the filing of this form 10-k, the company believes that it has
remedied its non-compliance with marketplace rule 4310(c)(14), subject to
nasdaqs affirmative completion of its compliance protocols and its
notification of the company accordingly. however, if the sec disagrees with the
manner in which the company has accounted for and reported, or not reported,
the financial impact of past stock option grants, there could be further delays
in filing subsequent sec reports that might result in delisting of the companys
common stock from the nasdaq global select market.unfavorable results
of legal proceedings could adversely affect the companys results of
operations.the company is subject to
various legal proceedings and claims that are discussed in part i, item 3
of this form 10-k. the company is also subject to certain other
legal proceedings and claims that have arisen in the ordinary course of
business and which have not been fully adjudicated. results of legal
proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty. in addition, litigation may be
disruptive to the companys normal21

the company fail to prevail in certain legal matters, the companys financial
condition, liquidity, or results of operations could be adversely affected.economic conditions and political events could
adversely affect the demand for the companys products and the financial health
of its suppliers, distributors, and resellers.the companys operating
performance depends significantly on economic conditions in the u.s. and
abroad. at times in the past, demand for the companys products has been
negatively impacted by difficult global economic conditions. uncertainty about
future economic conditions makes it difficult to forecast future demand for the
companys products and related operating results. should global and/or regional
economic conditions deteriorate, demand for the companys products could be
adversely affected, as could the financial health of its suppliers,
distributors, and resellers.war, terrorism, public health issues, and other
circumstances could disrupt supply, delivery, or demand of products, which
could negatively affect the companys operations and performance.war, terrorism, public health issues, and other
business interruptions, whether in the u.s. or abroad, have caused and could
cause damage or disruption to international commerce
and global economy, and thus may have a strong negative impact on the global
economy, the company, and the companys suppliers or customers. the
companys major business operations are subject to interruption by earthquake,
other natural disasters, fire, power shortages, terrorist attacks and other
hostile acts, labor disputes, public health issues, and other events beyond its
control. the majority of the companys research and development activities, its
corporate headquarters, information technology systems, and other critical
business operations, including certain component suppliers and manufacturing
vendors, are located near major seismic faults. because the company does not
carry earthquake insurance for direct quake-related losses, the companys
operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely
affected in the event of a major earthquake or other natural or man-made
disaster.although it is impossible
to predict the occurrences or consequences of any such events, such events
could result in a decrease in demand for the companys products, make it
difficult or impossible for the company to deliver products to its customers or
to receive components from its suppliers, and create delays and inefficiencies
in the companys supply chain. in addition, should major public health issues
including pandemics arise, the company could be negatively affected by more
stringent employee travel restrictions, additional limitations in the
availability of freight services, governmental actions limiting the movement of
products between various regions, delays in production ramps of new products,
and disruptions in the operations of the companys manufacturing vendors and
component suppliers. the companys operating results and financial condition
have been, and in the future may be, adversely affected by such events.the market for personal computers and related
peripherals and services, as well as digital music devices and related
services, is highly competitive. if the company is unable to effectively
compete in these markets, its results of operations could be adversely affected.the personal computer industry is highly competitive
and is characterized by aggressive pricing practices, downward pressure on
gross margins, frequent introduction of new products, short product life
cycles, evolving industry standards, continual improvement in product
price/performance characteristics, rapid adoption of technological and product
advancements by competitors, price sensitivity on the part of consumers, and a
large number of competitors. price competition in the market for personal computers
and related peripherals has been particularly intense as competitors who sell
windows and linux based personal computers have aggressively cut prices and
lowered their product margins for personal computing products. the companys
results of operations and financial condition have been, and in the future may
continue to be, adversely affected by these and other industry-wide pricing
pressures and downward pressures on gross margins.22



seq.=1,folio='22',file='c:\jms\skumar\06-25759-2\task1586490\25759-2-de.htm',user='105032',cd='dec 29 04:51 2006'the personal computer industry has also been
characterized by rapid technological advances in software functionality,
hardware performance, and features based on existing or emerging industry
standards. further, as the personal computer industry and its customers place
more reliance on the internet, an increasing number of internet devices that
are smaller and simpler than traditional personal computers may compete for
market share with the companys existing products. several competitors of the
company have targeted certain of the companys key market segments, including
consumer, education, professional and consumer digital video editing, and
design and publishing. several of the companys competitors have introduced
digital music products and/or online stores offering digital music distribution
that mimic many of the unique design, technical features, and solutions of the
companys products. the company has a significant number of competitors, many
of whom have broader product lines and larger installed customer bases than
those of the company. additionally, there has been a trend towards
consolidation in the personal computer industry that has resulted in larger and
potentially stronger competitors in the companys markets.the company is currently the only maker of hardware
using the mac os. the mac os has a minority market share in the personal
computer market, which is dominated by makers of computers utilizing competing
operating systems, including windows and linux. the companys future operating
results and financial condition are substantially dependent on its ability to
continue to develop improvements to the macintosh platform to maintain
perceived design and functional advantages over competing platforms. additionally,
if unauthorized copies of the mac os are used on other companies hardware
products and result in decreased demand for the companys hardware products,
the companys results of operations may be adversely affected.the company is currently focused on market
opportunities related to digital music distribution and related consumer
electronic devices, including ipods. the company faces significant competition
from other companies promoting their own digital music products including mp3
players, music enabled cell phones, free peer-to-peer music and video services,
and free streaming of digital content via the internet. these competitors
include both new entrants with different market approaches, such as
subscription services models, and also larger companies that may have
significant technical, marketing, distribution, and other resources, as well as
established hardware, software, and digital content supplier relationships.
failure to effectively compete could negatively affect the companys operating
results and financial position. the company expects competition in this space
to intensify as competitors attempt to imitate the companys approach to
tightly integrating these components within their individual offerings or work
more collaboratively with each other to offer solutions that are more
integrated than those they offer currently. some of these current and potential
competitors have substantial resources and may be able to provide such products
and services at little or no profit or even at a loss to compete with the
companys offerings. there can be no assurance the company will be able to
continue to provide products and services that effectively compete in these
markets. the company may also have to respond to price competition by lowering
prices and/or increasing features which could adversely affect the companys
music product gross margins as well as overall company gross margins.the company also faces
significant competition in the u.s. education market. u.s. elementary and
secondary schools, as well as college and university customers, remain a core
market for the company. in an effort to gain market share and remain
competitive, the company will continue to pursue one-to-one (1:1) learning
solutions in education. 1:1 learning
solutions typically consist of a
portable computer for every student and teacher along with the installation of
a wireless network. these 1:1
learning solutions and other strategic sales are generally priced more
aggressively and could result in significantly less profitability or financial
losses, particularly for larger deals. although the company believes it has
taken certain steps to strengthen its position in the education market, there
can be no assurance that the company will be able to increase or maintain its
share of the education market or execute profitably on large strategic23



seq.=1,folio='23',file='c:\jms\skumar\06-25759-2\task1586490\25759-2-de.htm',user='105032',cd='dec 29 04:51 2006'arrangements. failure to
do so may have an adverse impact on the companys operating results and
financial condition.future operating results are dependent upon the
companys ability to obtain a sufficient supply of components, including
microprocessors, some of which are in short supply or available only from
limited sources.although most components
essential to the companys business are generally available from multiple
sources, certain key components including microprocessors and asics are
currently obtained by the company from single or limited sources. some key
components (including without limitation dram, nand flash-memory, and tft-lcd
flat-panel displays), while currently available to the company from multiple
sources, are at times subject to industry-wide availability and pricing pressures.
in addition, new products introduced by the company often initially utilize
custom components obtained from only one source until the company has evaluated
whether there is a need for, and subsequently qualifies, additional suppliers.
in situations where a component or product utilizes new technologies, initial
capacity constraints may exist until such time as the suppliers yields have
matured. the company and other producers in the personal computer and consumer
electronics industries also compete for various components with other
industries that have experienced increased demand for their products. the
company uses some components that are not common to the rest of the personal
computer or consumer electronics industries. continued availability of these
components may be affected if producers decided to concentrate on the
production of components other than those customized to meet the companys
requirements. if the supply of a key component were delayed or constrained on a
new or existing product, the companys results of operations and financial
condition could be adversely affected.the company must successfully manage frequent product
introductions and transitions to remain competitive and effectively stimulate
customer demand.due to the highly volatile and competitive nature of
the personal computer and consumer electronics industries, which are
characterized by dynamic customer demand patterns and rapid technological
advances, the company must continually introduce new products and technologies,
enhance existing products to remain competitive, and effectively stimulate
customer demand for new products and upgraded versions of the companys
existing products. the success of new product introductions is dependent on a
number of factors, including market acceptance; the companys ability to manage
the risks associated with product transitions, including the transition to
intel-based macintosh computers, and production ramp issues; the availability
of application software for new products; the effective management of purchase
commitments and inventory levels in line with anticipated product demand; the
availability of products in appropriate quantities and costs to meet
anticipated demand; and the risk that new products may have quality or other
defects in the early stages of introduction. accordingly, the company cannot
determine in advance the ultimate effect new products will have on its sales or
results of operations.in june 2005, the
company announced its plan to begin using intel microprocessors in its
computers. during 2006, the company introduced new intel-based models of the
macbook pro, macbook, mac pro, imac, and mac mini computers. the companys
transition to intel microprocessors for macintosh systems was completed in august 2006,
and its transition for xserve was completed in november 2006. this
transition has been and will continue to be subject to numerous risks and
uncertainties including the timely innovation and delivery of related hardware
and software products to support intel microprocessors, market acceptance of
intel-based macintosh computers, and the development and availability on
acceptable terms of components and services essential to enable the company to
timely deliver intel-based macintosh computers. in addition, the company is
dependent on third-party software developers such as microsoft and adobe to
timely develop current and future applications that run on intel-based
macintosh computers. universal versions of microsoft office and adobes
creative suite applications are not currently available. additionally,
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to maintain its24



seq.=1,folio='24',file='c:\jms\skumar\06-25759-2\task1586490\25759-2-de.htm',user='105032',cd='dec 29 04:51 2006'historical gross margin
percentages on its products, including intel-based macintosh computers, which
may adversely impact the companys results of operations.the companys products from time to time experience
quality problems that can result in decreased net sales and operating profits.the company sells highly
complex hardware and software products that can contain defects in design and
manufacture. sophisticated operating system software and applications, such as
those sold by the company, often contain bugs that can unexpectedly interfere
with the operation of the software. defects may also occur in components and
products the company purchases from third-parties. there can be no assurance
that the company will be able to detect and fix all defects in the hardware and
software it sells. failure to do so could result in lost revenue, loss of
reputation, and significant warranty and other expense to remedy.because orders for components, and in some cases
commitments to purchase components, must be placed in advance of customer
orders, the company faces substantial inventory risk.the company records a write-down for inventories of
components and products that have become obsolete or are in excess of
anticipated demand or net realizable value and accrues necessary reserves for
cancellation fees for orders of products and components that have been
cancelled. although the company believes its inventory and related provisions
are currently adequate, given the rapid and unpredictable pace of product
obsolescence in the computer and consumer electronics industries and the
transition to intel-based macintosh computers, no assurance can be given that
the company will not incur additional inventory and related charges. in
addition, such charges have had, and may have, a material effect on the companys
financial position and results of operations.the company must order
components for its products and build inventory in advance of product
shipments. because the companys markets are volatile and subject to rapid
technology and price changes, and because of the transition to intel-based
macintosh computers, there is a risk the company will forecast incorrectly and
produce or order from third parties excess or insufficient inventories of
particular products. consistent with industry practice, components are normally
acquired through a combination of purchase orders, supplier contracts, and open
orders based on projected demand information. such purchase commitments
typically cover the companys forecasted component and manufacturing
requirements for periods ranging from 30 to 150 days. the companys operating
results and financial condition have been in the past and may in the future be
materially adversely affected by the companys ability to manage its inventory
levels and respond to short-term shifts in customer demand patterns.the company is dependent on manufacturing and
logistics services provided by third parties, many of whom are located outside
of the u.s.most of the companys products are manufactured in
whole or in part by third-party manufacturers. in addition, the company has
outsourced much of its transportation and logistics management. while outsourcing
arrangements may lower the cost of operations, they also reduce the companys
direct control over production and distribution. it is uncertain what effect
such diminished control will have on the quality or quantity of the products
manufactured or services rendered, or the flexibility of the company to respond
to changing market conditions. in addition, the company is reliant on
third-party manufacturers to adhere to the companys supplier code of conduct. moreover,
although arrangements with such manufacturers may contain provisions for
warranty expense reimbursement, the company may remain at least initially
responsible to the consumer for warranty service in the event of product
defects. any unanticipated product defect or warranty liability, whether
pursuant to arrangements with contract manufacturers or otherwise, could
adversely affect the companys future operating results and financial
condition.25



seq.=1,folio='25',file='c:\jms\skumar\06-25759-2\task1586490\25759-2-de.htm',user='105032',cd='dec 29 04:51 2006'final assembly of products
sold by the company is currently performed in the companys manufacturing
facility in cork, ireland, and by external vendors in fremont, california;
fullerton, california; taiwan; the republic of korea; the peoples republic of
china; and the czech republic. currently, manufacturing of many of the
components used in the companys products is performed by third-party vendors
in taiwan, china, japan, korea, and singapore. final assembly of substantially
all of the companys portable products, including macbook pros, macbooks, and
ipods, is performed by third-party vendors in china. if for any reason
manufacturing or logistics in any of these locations is disrupted by regional
economic, business, labor, environmental, public health, or political issues,
or due to information technology system failures or military actions, the companys
results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.the companys future operating performance is
dependent on the performance of distributors and other resellers of the companys
products.the company distributes its products through
wholesalers, resellers, national and regional retailers, and cataloguers, many
of whom distribute products from competing manufacturers. in addition, the
company sells many of its products and resells certain third-party products in
most of its major markets directly to end-users, certain education customers,
and certain resellers through its online stores around the world and its retail
stores. many of the companys resellers operate on narrow product margins and
have been negatively impacted in the past by weak economic conditions.
considerable trade receivables that are not covered by collateral or credit
insurance are outstanding with the companys distribution and retail channel
partners. the companys business and financial results could be adversely
affected if the financial condition of these resellers weakens, if resellers
within consumer channels were to cease distribution of the companys products,
or if uncertainty regarding demand for the companys products caused resellers
to reduce their ordering and marketing of the companys products. the company
has invested and will continue to invest in various programs to enhance
reseller sales, including staffing selected resellers stores with company
employees and contractors. these programs could require a substantial
investment from the company, while providing no assurance of return or
incremental revenue to offset this investment.over the past several
years, an increasing proportion of the companys net sales have been made by
the company directly to end-users through its online stores around the world
and through its retail stores in the u.s., canada, japan, and the u.k. some of
the companys resellers have perceived this expansion of the companys direct
sales as conflicting with their own businesses and economic interests as
distributors and resellers of the companys products. perception of such a
conflict could discourage the companys resellers from investing additional
resources in the distribution and sale of the companys products or lead them
to limit or cease distribution of the companys products. the companys
business and financial results could be adversely affected if expansion of its
direct sales to end-users causes some or all of its resellers to cease or limit
distribution of the companys products.the company relies
on third-party digital content, which may not be available to the company on
commercially reasonable terms or at all.the company contracts with third parties to offer
their digital content to customers through the companys itunes store. the
company pays substantial fees to obtain the rights to offer to its customers
this third-party digital content. the companys licensing arrangements with
these third-party content providers are short-term in nature and do not guarantee
the future renewal of these arrangements at commercially reasonable terms, if
at all. certain parties in the music industry have consolidated and formed
alliances, which could limit the availability and increase the fees required to
offer digital content to customers through the itunes store. some third-party
content providers currently or may in the future offer music products and
services that compete with the companys music products and services, and could
take action to make it more difficult or impossible for the company to license
their digital content in the future. further, other distributors of third-party
content or third-party content owners may seek to limit26



seq.=1,folio='26',file='c:\jms\skumar\06-25759-2\task1586490\25759-2-de.htm',user='105032',cd='dec 29 04:51 2006'the companys access to or increase the total cost of
such content. if the company is unable to continue to offer a wide variety of
digital content at reasonable prices with acceptable usage rules, or continue
to expand its geographic reach outside the u.s., then sales and gross margins
of the companys itunes store, as well as related hardware and peripherals,
including ipods, may be adversely affected.third-party content
providers and artists require that the company provide certain digital rights
management (drm) solutions and other security mechanisms. if the requirements
from content providers or artists change, then the company may be required to
further develop or license technology to address such new rights and
requirements. in addition, certain countries have passed legislation or may
propose legislation that would force the company to license its drm solutions
so that content would be interoperable with competitor devices, which could
lessen the protection of content subjecting it to piracy and could affect
arrangements with the companys content suppliers. there is no assurance the
company will be able to develop or license such solutions at a reasonable cost
and in a timely manner, if at all, which could have a materially adverse effect
on the companys operating results and financial position.the companys future performance is dependent upon
support from third-party software developers. if third-party software
applications cease to be developed or available for the companys hardware
products, then customers may choose not to buy the companys products.the company believes decisions by customers to
purchase the companys personal computers, as opposed to windows-based
systems, are often based on the availability of third-party software
applications such as microsoft office. the company also believes the
availability of third-party application software for the companys
hardware products depends in part on third-party developers perception
and analysis of the relative benefits of developing, maintaining, and upgrading
such software for the companys products versus software for the larger windows
market or growing linux market. this analysis may be based on factors such as
the perceived strength of the company and its products, the anticipated
potential revenue that may be generated, continued acceptance by customers of mac
os x, and the costs of developing such software products. to the extent the
minority market share held by the company in the personal computer market has
caused software developers to question the companys prospects in the personal
computer market, developers could be less inclined to develop new application
software or upgrade existing software for the companys products and more
inclined to devote their resources to developing and upgrading software for the
larger windows market or growing linux market. the companys recent
announcement that it plans to add a feature to the next version of mac os x
that will enable intel-based macintosh systems to run windows xp may deter
developers from creating software applications for mac os x if such
applications are available for the windows platform. moreover, there can be no
assurance software developers will continue to develop software for mac os x on
a timely basis or at all.in june 2005, the company announced its plan to
begin using intel microprocessors in its computers. during 2006, the company
introduced new intel-based models of the macbook pro, macbook, mac pro, imac,
and mac mini computers. the companys transition to intel microprocessors for
macintosh systems was completed in august 2006, and its transition for
xserve was completed in november 2006. the company depends on third-party
software developers to timely develop current and future applications that run
on intel microprocessors. universal versions of microsoft office and adobes
creative suite applications are not currently available. the lack of
applications that run on intel-based macintosh systems, including microsoft
office and adobe creative suite, could have a materially adverse effect on the
companys operating results and financial position.in addition, past and
future development by the company of its own software applications and
solutions may negatively impact the decision of software developers, such as
microsoft and adobe, to develop, maintain, and upgrade similar or competitive software
for the companys products. the company currently markets and sells a variety
of software applications for use by professionals, consumers, and education
customers that could influence the decisions of third-party software developers
to develop or27



seq.=1,folio='27',file='c:\jms\skumar\06-25759-2\task1586490\25759-2-de.htm',user='105032',cd='dec 29 04:51 2006'upgrade
macintosh-compatible software products. software applications currently
marketed by the company include software for professional film and video
editing, professional compositing and visual effects for large format film and
video productions, professional music production and music post production,
professional and consumer dvd encoding and authoring, professional digital
photo editing and workflow management, consumer digital video and digital photo
editing and management, digital music management, desktop-based database
management, word processing, and high-quality presentations. discontinuance of
third-party software products for the macintosh platform could have an adverse
effect on the companys net sales and results of operations.the companys business relies on access to patents and
intellectual property obtained from third parties, and the companys future
results could be adversely affected if it is alleged or found to have infringed
on the intellectual property rights of others.many of the companys products are designed to include
intellectual property obtained from third parties. while it may be necessary in
the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of its
products and business methods, the company believes that based upon past
experience and industry practice, such licenses generally could be obtained on
commercially reasonable terms. however, there can be no assurance that the
necessary licenses would be available or available on acceptable terms.because of technological
changes in the computer and consumer electronics industries, current extensive
patent coverage, and the rapid rate of issuance of new patents, it is possible
certain components of the companys products and business methods may
unknowingly infringe existing patents of others. the company has from time to
time been notified that it may be infringing certain patents or other
intellectual property rights of others. responding to such claims, regardless
of their merit, can be time-consuming, result in significant expenses, and
cause the diversion of management and technical personnel. several pending
claims are in various stages of evaluation. the company may consider the
desirability of entering into licensing agreements in certain of these cases.
however, no assurance can be given that such licenses can be obtained on
acceptable terms or that litigation will not occur. in the event there is a
temporary or permanent injunction entered prohibiting the company from
marketing or selling certain of its products or a successful claim of
infringement against the company requiring it to pay royalties to a
third-party, the companys future operating results and financial condition
could be adversely affected. information regarding certain claims and
litigation involving the company related to alleged patent infringement and
other matters is set forth in part i, item 3 of this form 10-k.
in the opinion of management, the company does not have a potential liability
for damages or royalties from any current legal proceedings or claims related
to the infringement of patent or other intellectual property rights of others
that would individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on
its results of operations or financial condition. however, the results of such
legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty. should the company fail
to prevail in any of the matters related to infringement of patent or other
intellectual property rights of others described in part i, item 3 of this
form 10-k or should several of these matters be resolved against the
company in the same reporting period, the operating results of a particular
reporting period could be materially adversely affected.the companys retail initiative has required and will
continue to require a substantial investment and commitment of resources and is
subject to numerous risks and uncertainties.through september 30, 2006, the company had
opened 165 retail stores. the companys retail initiative has required
substantial investment in equipment and leasehold improvements, information
systems, inventory, and personnel. the company has also entered into
substantial operating lease commitments for retail space with lease terms
ranging from 5 to 20 years, the majority of which are for 10 years. the company
could incur substantial costs should it choose to terminate these commitments
or close individual stores. such costs could adversely affect the companys
results of operations and financial condition. additionally, a relatively high
proportion of the retail segments costs are fixed because of personnel costs,28



seq.=1,folio='28',file='c:\jms\skumar\06-25759-2\task1586490\25759-2-de.htm',user='105032',cd='dec 29 04:51 2006'depreciation of store construction costs, and lease
expense. as a result, significant losses would result should the retail segment
experience a significant decline in sales for any reason.certain of the companys stores
have been designed and built to serve as high-profile venues that function
as vehicles for general corporate marketing, corporate events, and brand
awareness. because of their unique design elements, locations and size, these
stores require substantially more investment in equipment and leasehold improvements than the companys more typical
retail stores. the company has opened eight such stores through september 2006.
because of their location and size, these high-profile stores also require the
company to enter into substantially larger operating lease commitments compared
to those required for its more typical stores. current leases on such locations
have terms ranging from 10 to 14 years with total remaining commitments per location
ranging from $4 million to $33 million. closure or poor performance of one of
these high-profile stores could have a significant negative impact on the
companys results of operations and financial condition.many of the general risks
and uncertainties the company faces could also have an adverse impact on its
retail segment. also, many factors unique to retail operations present risks and uncertainties, some of which
are beyond the companys control, that could adversely affect the retail
segments future results, cause its actual results to differ from those
currently expected, and/or have an adverse effect on the companys consolidated
results of operations. potential risks and uncertainties unique to retail
operations that could have an adverse impact on the retail segment include,
among other things, macro-economic factors that have a negative impact on
general retail activity; inability to manage costs associated with store
construction and operation; inability to sell third-party hardware and software
products at adequate margins; failure to manage relationships with existing
retail channel partners; lack of experience in managing retail operations
outside the u.s.; costs associated with unanticipated fluctuations in the value
of apple-branded and third-party retail inventory; and inability to obtain and
renew leases in quality retail locations at a reasonable cost.investment in new business strategies and initiatives
could disrupt the companys ongoing business and may present risks not originally
contemplated.the company has and may in
the future invest in new business strategies or engage in acquisitions that
complement the companys strategic direction and product roadmap. such
endeavors may involve significant risks and uncertainties, including
distraction of managements attention away from current business operations;
insufficient revenue generation to offset liabilities assumed and expenses
associated with the strategy; and unidentified issues not discovered in the
companys due diligence process. because these new ventures are inherently
risky, no assurance can be given that such strategies and initiatives will be
successful and will not materially adversely affect the companys business,
operating results or financial condition.declines in the sales of the companys professional
products, software, accessories, or service and support contracts, or increases
in sales of consumer products, including ipods, may negatively impact the
companys gross margin and operating margin percentages.the companys professional products, including macbook
pro and mac pro systems, software, accessories, and service and support
contracts, generally have higher gross margins than the companys consumer
products, including the imac, mac mini, macbook, ipod, and content from the
itunes store. a shift in sales mix away from higher margin professional
products towards lower margin consumer products could adversely affect the
companys future gross margin and operating margin percentages. the companys
traditional professional customers may choose to buy consumer products,
specifically the imac and macbook, instead of professional products.
professional users may choose to buy the imac due to its relative price
performance and unique design featuring a flat panel screen. professional users
may also choose to purchase macbooks instead of the companys
professional-oriented portable products due to their price performance and
screen size. additionally, significant future growth in ipod sales without29

could also reduce gross margin and operating margin percentages.the company expects
its quarterly revenue and operating results to fluctuate for a variety of
reasons.the companys profit
margins vary among its products and its distribution channels. the companys
direct sales, primarily through its retail and online stores, generally have
higher associated profitability than its indirect sales. as a result, the
companys gross margin and operating margin percentages, as well as overall
profitability may be adversely impacted as a result of a shift in product,
geographic or channel mix, or new product announcements, including the
transition to intel-based macintosh computers. in addition, the company
generally sells more product during the third month of each quarter than it
does during either of the first two months, a pattern typical in the personal
computer and consumer electronics industries. this sales pattern can produce
pressure on the companys internal infrastructure during the third month of a
quarter and may adversely impact the companys ability to predict its financial
results accurately. furthermore, the company has typically experienced greater
net sales in the first and fourth fiscal quarters compared to other quarters in
the fiscal year due to seasonal demand related to the holiday season and the
beginning of the school year. developments late in a quarter, such as
lower-than-anticipated demand for the companys products, an internal systems
failure, or failure of one of the companys key logistics, components
suppliers, or manufacturing partners, could have significant adverse impacts on
the company and its results of operations and financial condition.the company has higher research and development and
selling, general and administrative costs, as a percentage of revenue, than
many of its competitors.the companys ability to
compete successfully and maintain attractive gross margins and revenue growth
is heavily dependent upon its ability to ensure a continuing and timely flow of
innovative and competitive products and technologies to the marketplace. as a
result, the company generally incurs higher research and development costs as a
percentage of revenue than its competitors who sell personal computers based on
other operating systems. many of these competitors seek to compete aggressively
on price and maintain very low cost structures. further, as a result of the
expansion of the companys retail segment and costs associated with marketing
the companys brand including its unique operating system, the company incurs
higher selling costs as a percentage of revenue than many of its competitors.
if the company is unable to continue to develop and sell innovative new
products with attractive gross margins, its results of operations may be
materially adversely affected by its operating cost structure.the company is exposed to credit risk on its accounts
receivable and prepayments related to long-term supply agreements. this risk is
heightened during periods when economic conditions worsen.the company distributes
its products through third-party computer resellers and retailers and directly
to certain educational institutions and commercial customers. a substantial
majority of the companys outstanding trade receivables are not covered by
collateral or credit insurance. the company also has unsecured non-trade
receivables from certain of its manufacturing vendors resulting from the sale
by the company of raw material components to these manufacturing vendors who manufacture
sub-assemblies or assemble final products for the company. in addition, the
company has entered into long-term supply agreements to secure supply of nand
flash-memory and has prepaid a total of $1.25 billion under these agreements.
while the company has procedures in place to monitor and limit exposure to
credit risk on its trade and non-trade receivables as well as long-term
prepayments, there can be no assurance such procedures will be effective in
limiting its credit risk and avoiding losses. additionally, if the global
economy or regional economies deteriorate, the company would be more likely to
incur a material loss or losses as a result of the weakening financial
condition of one or more of its customers or manufacturing vendors.30

success depends largely on its ability to attract and retain key personnel.much of the future success
of the company depends on the continued service and availability of skilled
personnel, including its chief executive officer, members of its executive
team, and those in technical, marketing and staff positions. experienced
personnel in the information technology industry are in high demand and
competition for their talents is intense, especially in the silicon valley,
where the majority of the companys key employees are located. the company has
relied on its ability to grant stock options as one mechanism for recruiting
and retaining this highly skilled talent. recent accounting regulations
requiring the expensing of stock options have resulted in increased stock-based
compensation expense, which may cause the company to reduce the amount of
stock-based awards issued to employees. there can be no assurance that the
company will continue to successfully attract and retain key personnel.the company is subject
to risks associated with the availability and coverage of insurance.for certain risks, the
company does not maintain insurance coverage because of cost and/or
availability. because the company retains some portion of its insurable risks,
and in some cases self insures completely, unforeseen or catastrophic losses in
excess of insured limits may have a material adverse effect on the companys
results of operations and financial position.failure of information technology systems and breaches
in the security of data upon which the company relies could adversely affect the
companys future operating results.information technology
system failures and breaches of data security could disrupt the companys
ability to function in the normal course of business by potentially causing
delays or cancellation of customer orders, impeding the manufacture or shipment
of products, or resulting in the unintentional disclosure of customer or
company information. management has taken steps to address these concerns for its
own systems by implementing sophisticated network security and internal control
measures. however, there can be no assurance that a system failure or data
security breach of the company or a third-party vendor will not have a material
adverse effect on the companys results of operations.the companys
business is subject to the risks of international operations.a large portion of the companys revenue is derived
from its international operations. as a result, the companys operating results
and financial condition could be significantly affected by risks associated
with international activities, including economic and labor conditions,
political instability, tax laws (including u.s. taxes on foreign subsidiaries),
and changes in the value of the u.s. dollar versus the local currency in which
the products are sold and goods and services are purchased. the companys
primary exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates relate to
non-u.s. dollar denominated sales in europe, japan, australia, canada, and
certain parts of asia and non-dollar denominated operating expenses incurred
throughout the world. weaknesses in foreign currencies, particularly the
japanese yen and the euro, can adversely impact consumer demand for the
companys products and the u.s. dollar value of the companys foreign currency
denominated sales. conversely, a strengthening in these and other foreign
currencies can cause the company to modify international pricing and affect the
value of the companys foreign denominated sales, and in some cases, may also
increase the cost to the company of some product components.margins on sales of the companys products in foreign
countries, and on sales of products that include components obtained from
foreign suppliers, can be adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate
fluctuations and by international trade regulations, including tariffs and
antidumping penalties.derivative instruments, such as foreign exchange
forward and option positions have been utilized by the company to hedge
exposures to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. the use of such
hedging activities may not offset more than a portion of the adverse financial
impact resulting from unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates.31

be found in part ii, item 8 of this form 10-k at notes 1 and 3
of notes to consolidated financial statements.the company is
subject to risks associated with environmental regulations.production and marketing
of products in certain states and countries may subject the company to
environmental and other regulations including, in some instances, the
requirement to provide customers the ability to return product at the end of
its useful life, and place responsibility for environmentally safe disposal or
recycling with the company. such laws and regulations have recently been passed
in several jurisdictions in which the company operates, including various
european union member countries, japan and certain states within the u.s.
although the company does not anticipate any material adverse effects in the
future based on the nature of its operations and the thrust of such laws, there
is no assurance such existing laws or future laws will not have a material
adverse effect on the companys financial condition, liquidity, or results of
operations.changes in
accounting rules could affect the companys future operating results.financial statements are
prepared in accordance with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles.
these principles are subject to interpretation by various governing bodies,
including the financial accounting standards board (fasb) and the sec, who
create and interpret appropriate accounting standards. a change from current
accounting standards could have a significant effect on the companys results
of operations. in december 2004, the fasb issued new guidance that
addresses the accounting for share-based payments, statement of financial
accounting standards (sfas) no. 123 (revised 2004) (sfas no. 123r),
share-based payment, which the company
adopted in 2006. in 2006, stock-based compensation expense reduced diluted
earnings per common share by approximately $0.14. although the adoption of sfas
no. 123r is expected to continue to have a significant impact on the
companys results of operations, future changes to various assumptions used to
determine the fair-value of awards issued or the amount and type of equity
awards granted create uncertainty as to the amount of future stock-based
compensation expense.changes in the
companys tax rates could affect its future results.the companys future
effective tax rates could be favorably or unfavorably affected by changes in
the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in
the valuation of the companys deferred tax assets and liabilities, or by
changes in tax laws or their interpretation. in addition, the company is
subject to the continuous examination of its income tax returns by the internal
revenue service and other tax authorities. the company regularly assesses the
likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine
the adequacy of its provision for income taxes. there can be no assurance the
outcomes from these continuous examinations will not have an adverse effect on
the companys results of operations and financial condition.the companys stock
price may be volatile.the companys stock has at
times experienced substantial price volatility as a result of variations
between its actual and anticipated financial results and as a result of
announcements by the company and its competitors. the stock market has
experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market
price of many technology companies in ways that may have been unrelated to the
operating performance of these companies. furthermore, the company believes its
stock price reflects high future growth and profitability expectations. if the
company fails to meet these expectations its stock price may significantly
decline. in addition, increases in the companys stock price may result in
greater dilution of earnings per share.32

personal computers and related software, services, peripherals, and networking
solutions. the company also designs, develops, and markets a line of portable
digital music players along with related accessories and services including the
online distribution of third-party music, audio books, music videos, short
films, television shows, movies, and ipod games. the companys products and
services include the macintosh line of desktop and notebook computers, the ipod
line of portable digital music players, the xserve server and xserve raid
storage products, a portfolio of consumer and professional software
applications, the mac os x operating system, the itunes store, a portfolio of
peripherals that support and enhance the macintosh and ipod product lines, and
a variety of other service and support offerings. the company sells its
products worldwide through its online stores, its retail stores, its direct
sales force, and third-party wholesalers, resellers, and value-added resellers.
in addition, the company sells a variety of third-party macintosh and ipod
compatible products including application software, printers, storage devices,
speakers, headphones, and various other accessories and supplies through its
online and retail stores. the company sells to education, consumer, creative
professional, business, and government customers. a further description of the
companys products may be found in part i, item 1 of this form 10-k
under the heading business.the company believes that for both professionals and
consumers the personal computer has become the center of an evolving digital
lifestyle by integrating and enhancing the utility of advanced digital devices
such as the companys ipods, digital video and still cameras, televisions, cd
and dvd players, cellular phones, personal digital assistants, and other
consumer electronic devices. the attributes of the personal computer that
enable this functionality include a high-quality user interface, easy access to
relatively inexpensive data storage, the ability to run complex applications,
and the ability to connect easily to a wide variety of other digital devices
and to the internet. the company is the only participant in the personal
computer industry that controls the design and development of the entire
personal computer-from the hardware and operating system to sophisticated
applications. this, along with its products innovative industrial designs,
intuitive ease-of-use, built-in graphics, multimedia and networking
capabilities, uniquely positions the company to offer innovative integrated
digital lifestyle solutions.the companys business strategy leverages its ability,
through the design and development of its own operating system, hardware, and many
software applications and technologies, to bring to its customers around the
world compelling new products and solutions with superior ease-of-use, seamless
integration, and innovative industrial design.the company participates in several highly competitive
markets, including personal computers with its macintosh line of computers,
consumer electronics with its ipod line of portable digital music players, and
distribution of third-party digital content through its online itunes store. while
the company is widely recognized as an innovator in the personal computer and
consumer electronic markets as well as a leader in the emerging market for
distribution of digital content, these are all highly competitive markets that
are subject to aggressive pricing and increased competition. to remain
competitive, the company believes increased investment in research and
development (r&d) and marketing and advertising is necessary to maintain
and extend its position in the markets where it competes. the companys r&d
spending is focused on delivering timely updates and enhancements to its
existing line of personal computers, displays, operating systems, software
applications, and portable digital music players; developing new digital
lifestyle consumer and professional software applications; and investing in new
product areas such as rack-mount servers, raid storage systems, and wireless
technologies. the company also believes investment in marketing and advertising
programs is critical to increasing product and brand awareness.49

begin using intel microprocessors in its computers. during 2006, the company
introduced new intel-based models of the macbook pro, macbook, mac pro, imac,
and mac mini computers. the companys transition to intel microprocessors for
macintosh systems was completed in august 2006, and its transition for
xserve was completed in november 2006. the macbook pro, macbook, mac pro,
imac, and mac mini feature mac os x version 10.4 tiger, ilife 06, and the
companys new translation technology, rosetta, which allows most powerpc-based
macintosh applications to run on intel-based macintosh computers. there are
potential risks and uncertainties that may occur due to this transition, which
are further discussed in item 1a under the heading risk factors.the company utilizes a variety of direct and indirect
distribution channels. the company believes sales of its innovative and
differentiated products are enhanced by knowledgeable salespersons who can
convey the value of the hardware, software, and peripheral integration,
demonstrate the unique digital lifestyle solutions that are available only on
macintosh computers, and demonstrate the compatibility of the macintosh with
the windows platform and networks. the company further believes providing a
high-quality sales and after-sales support experience is critical to attracting
and retaining customers. to ensure a high-quality buying experience for its
products in which service and education are emphasized, the company has
expanded and improved its distribution capabilities by opening its own retail
stores in the u.s. and internationally. the company had 165 stores open as of september 30,
2006.the company also staffs selected third-party stores
with the companys own employees to improve the buying experience through
reseller channels. the company has deployed apple employees and contractors in
reseller locations around the world including the u.s., europe, japan, and
australia. the company also sells to customers directly through its online
stores around the world.to improve access to the
ipod product line, the company has significantly expanded the number of
distribution points where ipods are sold. the ipod product line can be
purchased in certain department stores, member-only warehouse stores, large
retail chains, and specialty retail stores, as well as through the channels
listed above.critical accounting
policies and estimatesthe preparation of financial statements and related
disclosures in conformity with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles
and the companys discussion and analysis of its financial condition and
results of operations require the companys management to make judgments,
assumptions, and estimates that affect the amounts reported in its consolidated
financial statements and accompanying notes. note 1 of the notes to
consolidated financial statements of this form 10-k describes the
significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the
companys consolidated financial statements. management bases its estimates on
historical experience and on various other assumptions it believes to be
reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for
making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. actual
results may differ from these estimates and such differences may be material.management believes the
companys critical accounting policies and estimates are those related to
revenue recognition, allowance for doubtful accounts, inventory valuation and
inventory purchase commitments, warranty costs, stock-based compensation, and
income taxes. management believes these policies to be critical because they
are both important to the portrayal of the companys financial condition and
results, and they require management to make judgments and estimates about
matters that are inherently uncertain. the companys senior management has
reviewed these critical accounting policies and related disclosures with the
audit and finance committee of the companys board of directors.revenue recognitionnet sales consist primarily of revenue from the sale
of hardware, software, peripherals, digital content, and service and support
contracts. the company recognizes revenue pursuant to applicable accounting50



seq.=1,folio='50',file='c:\fc\36111332643_d11651_1583404\25759-2-di.htm',user='jmsproofassembler',cd='dec 27 11:34 2006'standards, including american institute of certified
public accountants statement of position (sop) no. 97-2, software revenue recognition, as amended, and sec staff
accounting bulletin (sab) no. 104, revenue recognition.the company recognizes revenue when persuasive
evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the sales price is
fixed or determinable, and collection is probable. product is considered
delivered to the customer once it has been shipped, and title and risk of loss
have been transferred. for most of the companys product sales, these criteria
are met at the time the product is shipped. for online sales to individuals,
for some sales to education customers in the u.s., and for certain other sales,
the company defers revenue until the customer receives the product because the
company retains a portion of the risk of loss on these sales during transit. if
at the outset of an arrangement the company determines the arrangement fee is
not, or is presumed not to be, fixed or determinable, revenue is deferred and
subsequently recognized as amounts become due and payable and all other
criteria for revenue recognition have been met.the company records
reductions to revenue for estimated commitments related to price protection and
for customer incentive programs, including reseller and end-user rebates, and
other sales programs and volume-based incentives. for transactions involving
price protection, the company recognizes revenue net of the estimated amount to
be refunded, provided the refund amount can be reasonably and reliably
estimated and the other conditions for revenue recognition have been met. if
refunds cannot be reliably estimated, revenue is not recognized until reliable
estimates can be made or the price protection lapses. for customer incentive
programs, the estimated cost of these programs is recognized at the later of
the date at which the company has sold the product or the date at which the
program is offered. the company also records reductions to revenue for expected
future product returns based on the companys historical experience. future
market conditions and product transitions may require the company to increase
customer incentive programs and incur incremental price protection obligations
that could result in additional reductions to revenue at the time such programs
are offered. additionally, certain customer incentive programs require
management to estimate the number of customers who will actually redeem the
incentive based on historical experience and the specific terms and conditions
of particular incentive programs. if a greater than estimated proportion of
customers redeem such incentives, the company would be required to record
additional reductions to revenue, which could have a material adverse impact on
the companys results of operations.allowance for
doubtful accountsthe company distributes its products through
third-party distributors and resellers and directly to certain education,
consumer, and commercial customers. the company generally does not require
collateral from its customers; however, the company will require collateral in
certain instances to limit credit risk. in addition, when possible, the company
does attempt to limit credit risk on trade receivables with credit insurance
for certain customers in latin america, europe, asia, and australia and by
arranging with third-party financing companies to provide flooring arrangements
and other loan and lease programs to the companys direct customers. these
credit-financing arrangements are directly between the third-party financing
company and the end customer. as such, the company generally does not assume
any recourse or credit risk sharing related to any of these arrangements.
however, considerable trade receivables that are not covered by collateral,
third-party flooring arrangements, or credit insurance are outstanding with the
companys distribution and retail channel partners.the
allowance for doubtful accounts is based on managements assessment of
the collectibility of specific customer accounts and includes consideration of
the credit worthiness and financial condition of those specific customers. the company records an allowance to reduce
the specific receivables to the amount that is reasonably believed to be
collectible. the company also records an
allowance for all other trade receivables based on multiple factors including historical
experience with bad debts, the general economic51



seq.=1,folio='51',file='c:\fc\36111332643_d11651_1583404\25759-2-di.htm',user='jmsproofassembler',cd='dec 27 11:34 2006'environment, the financial
condition of the companys distribution channels, and the aging of such receivables. if there is a deterioration of a major
customers financial condition, if the company becomes aware of additional
information related to the credit worthiness of a major customer, or if future
actual default rates on trade receivables in general differ from those
currently anticipated, the company may have to adjust its allowance for
doubtful accounts, which would affect earnings in the period the adjustments
were made.inventory valuation and inventory purchase commitmentsthe company must order components for its products and
build inventory in advance of product shipments. the company records a
write-down for inventories of components and products, including third-party
products held for resale, which have become obsolete or are in excess of anticipated
demand or net realizable value. the company performs a detailed review of
inventory each fiscal quarter that considers multiple factors including demand
forecasts, product life cycle status, product development plans, current sales
levels, and component cost trends. the personal computer and consumer
electronic industries are subject to a rapid and unpredictable pace of product
and component obsolescence and demand changes. if future demand or market
conditions for the companys products are less favorable than forecasted or if
unforeseen technological changes negatively impact the utility of component
inventory, the company may be required to record additional write-downs which
would negatively affect gross margins in the period when the write-downs were
recorded.the company accrues
reserves for estimated cancellation fees related to component orders that have
been cancelled or are expected to be cancelled. consistent with industry
practice, the company acquires components through a combination of purchase
orders, supplier contracts, and open orders based on projected demand
information. these commitments typically cover the companys requirements for
periods ranging from 30 to 150 days. if there is an abrupt and substantial
decline in demand for one or more of the companys products or an unanticipated
change in technological requirements for any of the companys products, the
company may be required to record additional reserves for cancellation fees
that would negatively affect gross margins in the period when the cancellation
fees are identified.warranty coststhe company provides currently for the estimated cost
for hardware and software warranties at the time the related revenue is
recognized based on historical and projected warranty claim rates, historical
and projected cost-per-claim, and knowledge of specific product failures that
are outside of the companys typical experience. each quarter, the company
reevaluates its estimates to assess the adequacy of its recorded warranty
liabilities considering the size of the installed base of products subject to
warranty protection and adjusts the amounts as necessary. if actual product failure rates or repair costs
differ from estimates, revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be
required and could negatively affect the companys results of
operations.the company periodically
provides updates to its applications and system software to maintain the
softwares compliance with specifications. the estimated cost to develop such
updates is accounted for as warranty costs that are recognized at the time
related software revenue is recognized. factors considered in determining
appropriate accruals related to such updates include the number of units
delivered, the number of updates expected to occur, and the historical cost and
estimated future cost of the resources necessary to develop these updates.stock-based
compensationthe company accounts for stock-based compensation in
accordance with sfas no. 123r. under the provisions of sfas no. 123r,
stock-based compensation cost is estimated at the grant date based on the awards
fair value as calculated by the black-scholes-merton (bsm) option-pricing
model and is recognized as expense ratably over the requisite service period. the
bsm model requires various highly52



seq.=1,folio='52',file='c:\fc\36111332643_d11651_1583404\25759-2-di.htm',user='jmsproofassembler',cd='dec 27 11:34 2006'judgmental assumptions including volatility,
forfeiture rates, and expected option life. if any of the assumptions used in
the bsm model change significantly, stock-based compensation expense may differ
materially in the future from that recorded in the current period.in connection with the
companys restatement of its consolidated financial statements, the company has
applied judgment in choosing whether to revise measurement dates for prior
option grants. information regarding the restatement, including ranges of
possible additional stock-based compensation expense if other measurement dates
had been selected for certain grants, is set forth in the explanatory note
immediately preceding part i, item 1 and in note 2, restatement of
consolidated financial statements in notes to consolidated financial
statements of this form 10-k.income taxesthe company records a tax provision for the
anticipated tax consequences of the reported results of operations. in
accordance with sfas no. 109, accounting for income
taxes, the provision for income taxes is computed using the asset
and liability method, under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are
recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between
the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, and for
operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. deferred tax assets and
liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to
taxable income in effect for the years in which those tax assets are expected
to be realized or settled. the company records a valuation allowance to reduce
deferred tax assets to the amount that is believed more likely than not to be
realized.management believes it is more likely than not that
forecasted income, including income that may be generated as a result of
certain tax planning strategies, together with the tax effects of the deferred
tax liabilities, will be sufficient to fully recover the remaining deferred tax
assets. in the event that all or part of the net deferred tax assets are
determined not to be realizable in the future, an adjustment to the valuation
allowance would be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made.
similarly, if the company subsequently realizes deferred tax assets that were
previously determined to be unrealizable, the respective valuation allowance
would be reversed, resulting in a positive adjustment to earnings in the period
such determination is made. in addition, the calculation of tax liabilities
involves significant judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the
application of complex tax laws. resolution of these uncertainties in a manner
inconsistent with managements expectations could have a material impact on the
companys results of operations and financial position.53

2006 increased 39% or $5.4 billion from 2005. this increase was due in part to
the fact that 2006 spanned 53 weeks while 2005 spanned 52 weeks. several other
factors contributed to these increases including the following:·       net sales of ipods increased $3.1 billion or 69% during 2006
compared to 2005. unit sales of ipods totaled 39.4 million in 2006, which
represents an increase of 75% from 22.5 million ipod units sold in 2005. strong
ipod sales during 2006 reflected significant sales of both the hard-drive based ipod that supports video,
first introduced in october of 2005 and the ipod nano, introduced in september 2005,
as well as continued expansion of ipod distribution points. during 2006,
the net sales per ipod unit sold decreased by 3% compared to 2005 primarily due
to an overall decrease in average selling prices for all ipods as well as a
shift in product mix to the ipod nano. from the introduction of the ipod in
2002 through 2006, the company has sold approximately 68 million ipods.·       macintosh net sales
increased $1.1 billion or 18% during 2006 compared to 2005. macintosh unit
sales increased by 769,000 units or 17% during 2006 compared to 2005. these increases were mainly due to strong demand
for the intel-based macbook and macbook pro systems and reflect a shift in
product mix to portable products in all of the companys operating segments. net
sales and unit sales of the companys portable products increased 43% and 42%,
respectively, during 2006 compared to 2005. macintosh desktop net sales and
unit sales both decreased by 3% during 2006 compared to 2005. the decrease in
sales of the companys macintosh desktops was due to declines in sales of the
companys professional-oriented desktop products. the company believes the
decline in the companys professional-oriented desktop products was due to
customers delaying purchases of such products in anticipation of the release of
the intel-based mac pro, which did not begin shipping until august 2006,
and updated software applications capable of running on intel-based macintosh
computers, and the trend toward portable computers. a slight increase of 1%
during 2006 in net sales per macintosh unit sold was due to a shift in mix to
higher-priced portable products, partially offset by price reductions on
certain macintosh systems.·       other
music related products and services consists of sales associated with the
itunes store and ipod services and accessories. net sales of other music
related products and services increased $986 million or 110% during 2006
compared to 2005. the increase was primarily due to increased net sales from
the itunes store and apple-branded and third-party ipod accessories and
services. the increase in sales from the itunes store stemmed from significant
growth in u.s. sales and the opening of the itunes store in japan during august 2005
and australia during october 2005. the increased sales from the itunes
store were also attributable to the availability of videos, television shows,
and feature-length movie downloads.·       net sales of software,
service, and other sales increased $188 million or 17% during 2006 compared to
2005. the growth was primarily attributable to increased net sales of applecare protection plan (app) extended service
and support contracts and application software, partially offset by a
decrease in sales of mac os x. mac os x
sales were particularly high in 2005 due to the release of mac os x tiger in april 2005.offsetting the
favorable factors discussed above, the companys net sales during 2006 were
negatively impacted by the following:·       net sales of peripherals and other hardware declined $26 million
or 2% compared to 2005 primarily due to price decreases and a decrease in net
sales of displays relating to a shift in mix from desktop to portable systems. the
decrease in net sales of displays for 2006 is consistent with the overall
decrease in unit sales of macintosh professional desktop systems.55fiscal year 2005 versus 2004during 2005, net
sales increased 68% or $5.7 billion from 2004. several factors contributed
favorably to net sales during 2005:·       net sales of ipods rose $3.2 billion or 248% during 2005 compared
to 2004. unit sales of ipods totaled 22.5 million in 2005, which represented an
increase of 409% from the 4.4 million ipod units sold in 2004. strong sales of
ipods during 2005 were experienced in all of the companys operating segments
and was driven by strong demand for the ipod
shuffle introduced in january 2005, the release of an updated version of
the ipod mini in february 2005, the release of the ipod nano in september 2005,
and expansion of the ipods distribution network. net sales per ipod
unit sold decreased 32% primarily due to the introduction of the lower priced
ipod shuffle in january 2005 and ipod mini pricing reductions in february 2005.
from the introduction of the ipod in 2002 through 2005, the company had sold
approximately 28 million ipods.·       net
sales of other music related products and services increased $621 million or
223% during 2005 compared to 2004. the company experienced strong growth in
sales of ipod services and accessories consistent with the increase in overall
ipod unit sales for 2005. the increased sales from the itunes store were
primarily due to substantial growth of net sales in the u.s. and expansion in
europe, canada, and japan.·       total
macintosh net sales increased $1.4 billion or 27% during 2005 compared to 2004.
unit sales of macintosh systems increased 1.2 million units or 38% during 2005
compared to 2004. the increases in macintosh net sales and unit sales related
primarily to strong demand for the companys desktop products, which was
experienced in all of the companys operating segments. the company believes
that the success of the ipod had a positive impact on macintosh net sales by
introducing new customers to the companys other products. desktop demand was
stimulated in 2005 due to the imac g5 and the introduction of the mac mini in january 2005.
net sales and unit sales of desktop products increased 45% and 55%,
respectively, during 2005 compared to 2004. macintosh net sales and unit sales
also included sales of the companys portable products, which increased 11% and
21%, respectively, compared to 2004.net sales per macintosh
unit sold decreased 7% on a year-over-year basis. the decrease was the result
of changes in the overall unit mix towards relatively lower-priced consumer
products, specifically the impact of the mac mini product, and desktop and
portable price reductions. this decrease was partially offset by an increase in
the proportion of direct sales.·       net
sales of peripherals and other hardware rose by 18% during 2005 compared to
2004 primarily due to an increase in net sales of displays and other computer
accessories. net sales of other
hardware include airport cards and base stations, xserve raid storage, isight
digital video cameras, and third-party hardware products.·       net sales of software, service and other sales
rose $270 million or 33% during 2005 compared to 2004. this growth was
primarily attributable to increased net sales in app extended service and
support contracts, driven primarily by higher associated macintosh computer
sales. additionally, the company experienced increases in net sales of .mac
internet service, professional and consumer applications, third-party software,
and mac os x that was primarily attributable to the release of version 10.4
tiger in april 2005.segment operating
performancethe company manages its
business primarily on a geographic basis. the companys reportable operating
segments are comprised of the americas, europe, japan, and retail. the
americas, europe, and japan reportable segments do not include activities
related to the retail segment. the americas segment includes both north and
south america. the europe segment includes european countries as well as the56middle east and africa.
the retail segment operated apple-owned retail stores in the u.s., canada,
japan, and the u.k. during 2006. each reportable geographic operating segment
provides similar hardware and software products and similar services. further
information regarding the companys operating segments may be found in note 11,
segment information and geographic data in notes to consolidated financial
statements of this form 10-k.americasduring 2006, net sales in the americas segment
increased $2.7 billion, or 41%, compared to 2005. the main factors for this
increase were significant increases in net sales of ipods, other music related
products and services, macintosh portable systems, and app. sales of ipods
increased primarily due to the introduction of the updated ipod with
video-playing capabilities in october 2005 and the ipod nano during september 2005.
the increase in other music related products and services was due to increases
in sales of apple-branded and third-party ipod accessories and sales from the
itunes store. the increase in sales of macintosh portable systems in the
americas was due to strong sales of the intel-based macbook and macbook pro
during 2006. the overall increase in net sales was partially offset by a
decline in net sales of desktops, displays, and mac os x. the decrease in
desktop products and displays net sales reflects the overall shift in product
mix toward portable macintosh systems. mac os x sales decreased from 2005 since
the company has not released a new version of mac os x since tiger began
shipping in april 2005. during 2006, the americas segment represented
approximately 48% of the companys total net sales as compared to 47% in the
same period of 2005. during 2006, u.s. education channel net sales and
macintosh unit sales increased by 13% and 11%, respectively, compared to 2005.
net sales from the higher education market grew 22% during 2006 compared to
2005 due to strong sales of macintosh portable products and ipods. net sales
were relatively flat for k-12 due to continued budget constraints.during 2005, net sales in
the americas segment grew 64% or $2.6 billion compared to 2004. the increase in
net sales during 2005 was primarily attributable to the significant
year-over-year increase in ipod sales, sales of other music related products
and services, and strong sales of desktop and portable macintosh systems. this
increase was partially offset by a shift in sales to the retail segment, which
had 117 stores in the u.s. and canada as of the end of 2005. macintosh unit
sales also increased by 30% in 2005 compared to 2004, driven primarily by
strong sales of desktop systems largely attributable to strong sales from the
updated imac, which began shipping in september 2004, and the mac mini,
which was introduced in january 2005. during 2005 and 2004, the americas
segment represented approximately 47% and 49%, respectively, of the companys
total net sales and represented approximately 48% and 51%, respectively, of
total macintosh unit sales. the company experienced an increase in both u.s.
education channel net sales and unit sales of 21% for 2005 compared to 2004.
strength in higher education sales related primarily to strong imac and
portable system shipments. this strength drove year-over-year growth in net
sales of 32% for the higher education channel during 2005. despite challenges
in the k-12 market from continued budget constraints and competitive
pressures, the companys k-12 net sales grew year-over-year by 11% during
2005 due to increased ibook sales and 1:1 education sales.europeeurope segment net sales increased $1.0 billion or 33%
during 2006 compared to 2005. consistent with the americas segment, these
increases were a result of strong growth in ipod sales, other music related
products and services, and macintosh portable systems. sales of ipods increased
primarily due to the introduction of the updated ipod with video-playing
capabilities in october 2005 and the ipod nano during september 2005.
the increase in other music related products and services was due to increases
in sales of apple-branded and third-party ipod accessories and sales from the
itunes store. the increase in sales of portable systems in europe was due to
strong sales of the intel-based macbook and macbook pro that were introduced
during 2006. in addition, europe also reported increased sales in app related
to the increase in macintosh unit sales. these increases were partially offset
by a decrease in desktop and57mac os x net sales during 2006 compared to
2005. the decrease in desktop net sales was due to the shift in product mix toward
portable macintosh systems. mac os x sales have decreased from 2005 since the
company has not released a new version of mac os x since tiger began shipping
in april 2005.during 2005, net sales in
the europe segment grew $1.3 billion or 71% from 2004. total macintosh unit
sales in europe also experienced growth during the current year by increasing
47% in 2005 compared to 2004. consistent with the americas segment, europe
experienced strong net sales of desktop products, ipod, other music related
products and services, and software and service sales. demand in europe during
2005 was particularly strong for the companys desktop computers, which
experienced a year-over-year increase of 56% from 2004. similar to the results
of the companys other segments, net sales of ipods, peripherals and software
were strong in 2005.japanjapans net sales increased $288 million or 31% during
2006 compared to 2005. the japan segment experienced increased net sales in
ipods, macintosh portable products,
and other music related products and services. consistent with the companys
other segments, japan experienced increases in sales of ipods due to the
introduction of the ipod with video-playing capabilities and the ipod nano in october and
september of 2005, respectively. japan also experienced strong sales of
the intel-based macbook and increased sales from the itunes store. these
increases were partially offset by decreases in net sales of macintosh desktop
products, displays, and mac os x. the decreases in desktop products and
displays reflect the overall shift in product mix toward portable macintosh
systems. mac os x sales have decreased from
2005 since the company has not released a new version of mac os x since tiger
began shipping in april 2005. total macintosh unit sales during
2006 remained relatively flat compared to 2005. the relatively flat growth in
macintosh unit sales is partially attributable to japans overall slow consumer
pc market growth. the company is continuing to evaluate ways to improve its
indirect and direct channel sales in japan.japans net sales and
macintosh unit sales were up 36% and 8%, respectively, during 2005 compared to
2004. japan experienced increased net sales in desktop products, ipod, and
other music related products and services. desktop net sales and unit sales
increased by 31% and 41%, respectively, and ipod sales increased by 220% during
2005 compared to 2004. the overall increase in net sales was partially offset
by a decline in portable system net sales during 2005 compared to 2004, which
the company believes might have been attributable to a shift in sales from
portables to the imac g5 and mac mini, and a shift to the retail segment as a
result of opening two additional stores in japan during 2005.retailthe company opened 41 new retail stores during 2006,
including a total of 10 international stores in the u.k., japan, and canada,
bringing the total number of open stores to 165 as of september 30, 2006. this
compares to 124 open stores as of september 24, 2005 and 86 open stores as
of september 25, 2004.the retail segments net sales increased by 43% to
$3.4 billion during 2006 compared to 2005. retail segment macintosh unit sales
increased 45% during 2006 compared to 2005.
with an average of 142 stores open during 2006, average revenue per store
increased to $23.6 million compared to $22.4 million during 2005 and $15.6
million in 2004. the current year increase was primarily due to strong
sales of macintosh portable and desktop products, ipods, and other music
related products and services. sales of
ipods increased primarily due to the introduction of the updated ipod with
video-playing capabilities in october 2005 and the ipod nano during september 2005.
the increase in other music related products and services was due to increased
sales of apple-branded and third-party ipod accessories. macintosh portable and
desktop sales increased due to strong sales of the intel-based macbook, macbook
pro, and imac.as measured by the companys operating segment
reporting, the retail segment reported operating income of $198 million during
2006 as compared to operating income of $151 million during 2005 and58operating income of $39 million during 2004. this
improvement was primarily attributable to the impact of opening new stores and
the segments year-over-year increase in average revenue per store, which
resulted in higher leverage on occupancy, depreciation, and other fixed costs.expansion of the retail
segment has required and will continue to require a substantial investment in
fixed assets and related infrastructure, operating lease commitments,
personnel, and other operating expenses. capital expenditures associated with
the retail segment were $200 million in 2006, bringing the total capital
expenditures since inception of the retail segment to approximately $729
million. as of september 30, 2006, the retail segment had approximately
5,787 employees and had outstanding operating lease commitments associated with
retail store space and related facilities of approximately $887 million. the
company would incur substantial costs if it were to close its retail stores.
such costs could adversely affect the companys results of operations and
financial condition.gross margingross

note immediately preceding part i, item 1 and note 2, restatement of
consolidated financial statements in notes to consolidated financial
statements of this form 10-k.gross margin percentage of 29.0% in 2006 remained flat
as compared to 2005. the company experienced more favorable pricing on certain
commodity components including lcd flat-panel displays and dram memory and
higher overall revenue that provided for more leverage on fixed production
costs, offset by an increase in lower margin ipod sales and other music-related
services.the company anticipates that its gross margin and the
gross margins of the personal computer and consumer electronics industries will
be under pressure due to price competition. the company expects gross margin
percentage to decline sequentially in the first quarter of 2007 primarily as a
result of a shift in the mix of revenue toward lower margin products such as
the ipod and content from the itunes store.the foregoing statements regarding the companys
expected gross margin percentage are forward-looking. there can be no assurance
that current gross margin percentage will be maintained or targeted gross
margin percentage levels will be achieved. in general, gross margins and
margins on individual products, including ipods, will remain under significant
downward pressure due to a variety of factors, including continued industry
wide global pricing pressures, increased competition, compressed product life
cycles, potential increases in the cost and availability of raw material and
outside manufacturing services, and potential changes to the companys product
mix, including higher unit sales of consumer products with lower average
selling prices and lower gross margins. in response to these competitive
pressures, the company expects it will continue to take pricing actions with
respect to its products. gross margins could also be affected by the companys
ability to effectively manage product quality and warranty costs and to
stimulate demand for certain of its products. due to the companys significant
international operations, financial results can be significantly affected in
the short-term by fluctuations in exchange rates.the company orders components for its products and
builds inventory in advance of product shipments. because the companys markets
are volatile and subject to rapid technology and price changes, there is a59risk the company will forecast incorrectly and produce
or order from third-parties excess or insufficient inventories of particular
products or components. the companys operating results and financial condition
in the past have been and may in the future be materially adversely affected by
the companys ability to manage its inventory levels and outstanding purchase
commitments and to respond to short-term shifts in customer demand
patterns.gross margin percentage
increased in 2005 to 29.0% of net sales from 27.3% of net sales in 2004. the
companys gross margin during 2005 increased due to more favorable pricing on
certain commodity components including lcd flat-panel displays and dram memory;
an increase in higher margin software sales; a favorable shift in direct sales
related primarily to the companys retail and online stores; and higher overall
revenue that provided for more leverage on fixed production costs. these
increases to gross margin were partially offset by an increase in lower margin
ipod sales.operating expensesoperating

development (r&d)expenditures for r&d
increased 33% or $177 million to $712 million in 2006 compared to $535 million
in 2005. the increase was due primarily to an increase in r&d headcount in
the current year to support expanded r&d activities, an increase of $46
million in stock-based compensation recognized as r&d expense resulting
from the adoption of sfas no. 123r, and higher overall expenses due to the 14th week added to the first fiscal quarter of
2006 to realign the companys fiscal quarters with calendar quarters. in addition, during 2005, the company
capitalized approximately $29.7 million of costs associated with the
development of mac os x tiger. no software development costs were capitalized
during 2006. further information related to the companys capitalization of
software development costs may be found in part ii, item 8 of this form 10-k
at note 1 of notes to consolidated financial statements. despite the increase
in expenditures, r&d as a percentage of net sales remained relatively flat
in 2006 as compared to 2005 due to the significant increase in revenue. the
company continues to believe that focused investments in r&d are critical
to its future growth and competitive position in the marketplace and are
directly related to timely development of new and enhanced products that are
central to the companys core business strategy. as such, the company expects
to make further investments in r&d to remain competitive.selling, general,
and administrative expense (sg&a)expenditures for sg&a increased $569 million or
31% during 2006 compared to 2005. these increases are due primarily to the
companys continued expansion of its retail segment in both domestic and
international markets, an increase of $50 million in stock-based compensation
expense recognized as60sg&a expense resulting from the adoption of sfas no. 123r,
a current year increase in discretionary spending on marketing and advertising,
higher direct and channel selling expenses resulting from the increase in net
sales and employee salary merit increases, and the expenses associated with the 14th week added to the first fiscal
quarter of 2006. despite the increase in expenditures, sg&a as a
percentage of total net sales in 2006 remained flat as compared to 2005.expenditures for sg&a
increased $434 million or 30% during 2005 compared to 2004. these increases are
due primarily to the companys continued expansion of its retail segment in
both domestic and international markets, a current year increase in
discretionary spending on marketing and advertising, and higher direct and
channel selling expenses resulting from the increase in net sales and employee
salary merit increases. sg&a as a percentage of total net sales in 2005 was
13%, down from 17% in 2004, which is due to the increase in total net sales of
68% for the company during 2005.fiscal 2004 restructuring
actionsduring 2004, the company
recorded total restructuring charges of approximately $23.0 million, including
approximately $14.0 million in severance costs, $5.5 million in asset
impairments, and $3.5 million for lease cancellations. the lease cancellations
relate to vacating a leased sales facility as a result of a european workforce
reduction during 2004. of the $23.0 million charges, $21.3 million had been
utilized by the end of 2006, with the remainder consisting of $1.7 million for
lease cancellations. these actions resulted in the termination of 452
positions.other income and

non-current investmentsthe company previously
held significant investments in arm holdings plc (arm), akamai technologies, inc. (akamai), and earthlink network, inc.
(earthlink). the company sold all of the remaining holdings in these
non-current investments in 2004 and 2003. pretax gains recorded upon the sale
of these non-current investments were $4 million in 2004.interest and other
income, nettotal interest and other income, net increased $200
million or 121% to $365 million during 2006 compared to $165 million in
2005 and $53 million in 2004. these increases are attributable primarily to
higher cash and short-term investment balances and increasing investment yields
resulting from higher market interest rates and the 14th week added to the first fiscal quarter of 2006. the
weighted average interest rate earned by the company on its cash, cash
equivalents, and short-term investments increased to 4.58% in 2006 compared to
the 2.70% and 1.38% rates earned during 2005 and 2004, respectively. the
current year increase in other income was partially offset by higher foreign
currency hedging expenses.interest expense in 2004
consisted primarily of interest on the companys $300 million aggregate
principal amount unsecured notes, which were repaid upon their maturity in february 2004.
the unsecured notes61were sold at 99.925% of
par for an effective yield to maturity of 6.51%. total deferred gain resulting
from the closure of debt swaps of approximately $23 million was fully amortized
as of the notes maturity in february 2004.provision for
income taxesthe companys effective tax rate for the year ended september 30,
2006 was approximately 29%. the companys effective rate differs from the
statutory federal income tax rate of 35% due primarily to certain undistributed
foreign earnings for which no u.s. taxes are provided because such earnings are
intended to be indefinitely reinvested outside the u.s. in addition, the
company recorded a tax benefit of $20 million due to settlement of prior year
tax audits in the u.s., and a net benefit of $20 million resulting from the
dividend repatriation under the american jobs creation act of 2004 (ajca) and
international tax planning strategies associated with the repatriation as
further discussed below.as of september 30, 2006, the company had
deferred tax assets arising from deductible temporary differences, tax losses,
and tax credits of $739 million before being offset against certain deferred
liabilities and a valuation allowance for presentation on the companys balance
sheet. management believes it is more likely than not that forecasted income,
including income that may be generated as a result of certain tax planning
strategies, together with the tax effects of the deferred tax liabilities, will
be sufficient to fully recover the remaining deferred tax assets. as of september 30,
2006 and september 24, 2005, a valuation allowance of $5 million was
recorded against the deferred tax asset for the benefits of state operating
losses that may not be realized. the company will continue to evaluate the
realizability of the deferred tax assets quarterly by assessing the need for
and amount of the valuation allowance.on october 22, 2004, the ajca was signed into law.
the ajca included a provision for the deduction of 85% of certain foreign
earnings that were repatriated, as defined in the ajca, within a specified time
frame. among other requirements, dividends qualifying for the 85% deduction
must be reinvested in the united states in certain qualified investments
pursuant to a domestic reinvestment plan approved by the ceo and board of
directors. during 2006, the company repatriated approximately $1.6 billion of
foreign earnings. of the earnings repatriated, $755 million is eligible for the
reduced tax rate provided by the ajca. accordingly, the company recorded a tax
charge of $51 million related to the repatriation of foreign earnings under the
provisions of the ajca. in addition, the company recorded a tax benefit of $71 million
resulting from the implementation of tax planning strategies to recognize
deferred tax assets that were previously not recognizable within certain
foreign subsidiaries.the internal revenue service (irs) has substantially
completed its field audit of the companys federal income tax returns for the
years 2002 through 2003 and proposed certain adjustments. the company intends
to contest certain of these adjustments through the irs appeals office. substantially
all irs audit issues for years prior to 2002 have been resolved. in addition,
the company is subject to audits by state, local, and foreign tax authorities. management
believes that adequate provision has been made for any adjustments that may
result from tax examinations. however, the outcome of tax audits cannot be
predicted with certainty. should any issues addressed in the companys tax
audits be resolved in a manner not consistent with managements expectations,
the company could be required to adjust its provision for income tax in the
period such resolution occurs.62

pronouncementsin september 2006, the sec issued sab no. 108,
considering the effects of prior year misstatements
when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements. sab
no. 108 provides guidance on how prior year misstatements should be
considered when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements
for purposes of determining whether the current years financial statements are
materially misstated. sab no. 108 is effective for fiscal years ending
after november 15, 2006. although the company will continue to evaluate
the application of sab no. 108, management does not currently believe
adoption will have a material impact on the companys results of operations or
financial position.in september 2006, the fasb issued sfas no. 157,
fair value measurements, which defines
fair value, provides a framework for measuring fair value, and expands the
disclosures required for fair value measurements. sfas no. 157 applies to
other accounting pronouncements that require fair value measurements; it does
not require any new fair value measurements. sfas no. 157 is effective for
fiscal years beginning after november 15, 2007 and is required to be
adopted by the company beginning in the66first quarter of fiscal 2009. although the company

no. (fin) 48, accounting for uncertainty
in income taxes-an interpretation of fasb statement no. 109. fin
no. 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes by

disclose in their financial statements uncertain tax positions that they have
taken or expect to take in a tax return. fin no. 48 is effective for
fiscal years beginning after december 15, 2006 and is required to be

2006, the company had $10.11 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and short-term
investments, an increase of $1.85 billion over the same balances at the end of
2005. the principal67components of this
increase were cash generated by operating activities of $2.22 billion, proceeds
of $318 million from the issuance of common stock under stock plans, and excess
tax benefits from stock-based compensation of $361 million, partially offset by
cash used to purchase property, plant, and equipment of $657 million and
repurchases of common stock of $355 million in conjunction with net-share
settlements on vested restricted stock and restricted stock units. cash
generated from operating activities includes the impact of the $1.25 billion
prepayment for nand flash memory components. the companys short-term
investment portfolio is primarily invested in high credit quality, liquid
investments. as of september 30, 2006, approximately $4.1 billion of the
companys cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments were held by
foreign subsidiaries and are generally based in u.s. dollar-denominated
holdings. amounts held by foreign subsidiaries are generally subject to u.s.
income taxation on repatriation to the u.s.the company believes its
existing balances of cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments
will be sufficient to satisfy its working capital needs, capital expenditures,
stock repurchase activity, outstanding commitments, and other liquidity
requirements associated with its existing operations over the next 12 months.capital
expendituresthe companys total
capital expenditures were $657 million during 2006, consisting of $200 million
for retail store facilities and equipment related to the companys retail
segment, $263 million for real estate acquisitions for the companys second corporate campus and for a new data center,
and $194 million for corporate infrastructure, including information systems
enhancements. the company currently
anticipates it will utilize approximately $675 million for capital expenditures
during 2007, including approximately $360 million for expansion of the companys
retail segment, approximately $50 million for real estate acquisitions
including the companys second corporate campus and its new data center, and
approximately $265 million to support normal replacement of existing capital
assets and enhancements to general information technology infrastructure.stock repurchase
planin july 1999, the
companys board of directors authorized a plan for the company to repurchase up
to $500 million of its common stock. this repurchase plan does not obligate the
company to acquire any specific number of shares or acquire shares over any
specified period of time. the company has repurchased a total of 13.1 million
shares at a cost of $217 million under this plan and was authorized to
repurchase up to an additional $283 million of its common stock as of september 30,
2006.off-balance sheet
arrangements and contractual obligationsthe company has not entered into any transactions with
unconsolidated entities whereby the company has financial guarantees,
subordinated retained interests, derivative instruments, or other contingent
arrangements that expose the company to material continuing risks, contingent
liabilities, or any other obligation under a variable interest in an
unconsolidated entity that provides financing, liquidity, market risk, or
credit risk support to the company.the

2006, the company had total outstanding commitments on noncancelable operating
leases of approximately $1.2 billion, $887 million of which related to the
lease of retail space and related facilities. lease terms on the companys existing
major facility operating leases range from 5 to 15 years.purchase
commitments with contract manufacturers and component suppliersthe company utilizes several contract manufacturers to
manufacture sub-assemblies for the companys products and to perform final
assembly and test of finished products. these contract manufacturers acquire
components and build product based on demand information supplied by the
company, which typically covers periods ranging from 30 to 150 days. the
company also obtains individual components for its products from a wide variety
of individual suppliers. consistent with industry practice, the company
acquires components through a combination of purchase orders, supplier
contracts, and open orders based on projected demand information. such purchase
commitments typically cover the companys forecasted component and
manufacturing requirements for periods ranging from 30 to 150 days. as of september 30,
2006, the company had outstanding third-party manufacturing commitments and component
purchase commitments of approximately $2.3 billion.during 2006, the company
entered into long-term supply agreements with hynix semiconductor, inc.,
intel corporation, micron technology, inc., samsung electronics co., ltd.,
and toshiba corporation to secure supply of nand flash memory through calendar
year 2010. as part of these agreements, the company prepaid $1.25 billion for
flash memory components during 2006. these prepayments will be applied to
inventory purchases made over the life of each respective agreement.asset retirement
obligationsthe companys asset
retirement obligations are associated with commitments to return property
subject to operating leases to original condition upon lease termination. as of
september 30, 2006, the company estimates that gross expected future cash
flows of approximately $19 million will be required to fulfill these
obligations.other obligationsthe companys other
obligations of approximately $39 million are primarily related to internet and
telecommunications services.indemnificationsthe company generally does not indemnify end-users of
its operating system and application software against legal claims that the
software infringes third-party intellectual property rights. other agreements
entered into by the company sometimes include indemnification provisions under
which the company could be subject to costs and/or damages in the event of an
infringement claim against the company or an indemnified third-party. however,
the company has not been required to make any significant payments resulting
from such an infringement claim asserted against itself or an indemnified
third-party and, in the opinion of management, does not have a liability
related to unresolved infringement claims subject to indemnification that would
have a material adverse effect on its financial condition, liquidity or results
of operations.69

riskin general, the company is a net receiver of foreign
currencies. accordingly, changes in exchange rates, and in particular a
strengthening of the u.s. dollar, may negatively affect the companys net sales
and gross margins as expressed in u.s. dollars. there is also a risk the
company will have to adjust local currency product pricing due to competitive
pressures when there has been significant volatility in foreign currency
exchange rates.the company may enter into foreign currency forward and
option contracts with financial institutions to protect against foreign
exchange risks associated with existing assets and liabilities, certain firmly
committed transactions, forecasted future cash flows, and net investments in
foreign subsidiaries. generally, the companys practice is to hedge a majority
of its existing material foreign exchange transaction exposures. however, the
company may not hedge certain foreign exchange transaction exposures due to
immateriality, prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures, and
limited availability of appropriate hedging instruments.to provide a meaningful assessment of the foreign
currency risk associated with certain of the companys foreign currency
derivative positions, the company performed a sensitivity analysis using a
value-at-risk (var) model to assess the potential impact of fluctuations in
exchange rates. the var model consisted of using a monte carlo simulation to
generate 3,000 random market price paths. the var is the maximum expected loss
in fair value, for a given confidence interval, to the companys foreign
exchange portfolio due to adverse movements in rates. the var model is not
intended to represent actual losses but is used as a risk estimation and
management tool. the model assumes normal market conditions. forecasted
transactions, firm commitments, and assets and liabilities denominated in
foreign currencies were excluded from the model. based on the results of the
model, the company estimates with 95% confidence a maximum one-day loss in fair
value of $9.2 million as of september 30, 2006 compared to a maximum
one-day loss of $10.0 million as of september 24, 2005. because the
company uses foreign currency instruments for hedging purposes, losses incurred
on those instruments are generally offset by increases in the fair value of the
underlying exposures.actual future gains and losses associated with the
companys investment portfolio and derivative positions may differ materially
from the sensitivity analyses performed as of september 30, 2006 due to
the inherent limitations associated with predicting the changes in the timing
and amount of interest rates, foreign currency exchanges rates, and the companys
actual exposures and positions.71

and its wholly-owned subsidiaries (the company) designs, manufactures, and
markets personal computers and related software, services, peripherals, and
networking solutions. the company also designs, develops, and markets a line of
portable digital music players along with related accessories and services
including the online sale of third-party audio and video products. the company
sells its products worldwide through its online stores, its retail stores, its
direct sales force, and third-party wholesalers, resellers, and value-added
resellers. in addition, the company sells a variety of third-party macintosh
and ipod compatible products including application software, printers, storage
devices, speakers, headphones, and various other accessories and supplies
through its online and retail stores. the company sells to education, consumer,
creative professional, business, and government customers.basis of
presentation and preparationthe accompanying consolidated financial statements
include the accounts of the company. intercompany accounts and transactions
have been eliminated. the preparation of these consolidated financial
statements in conformity with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts
reported in these consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes.
actual results could differ materially from those estimates. certain prior year
amounts in the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto have been
reclassified to conform to the current year presentation.typically, the companys
fiscal year ends on the last saturday of september. fiscal years 2005 and 2004 were each 52-week
years. however, approximately every six years, the company reports a 53-week
fiscal year to align its fiscal quarters with calendar quarters by adding a
week to its first fiscal quarter. the company added this additional week in the
first fiscal quarter of its fiscal year 2006. all information presented herein
is based on the companys fiscal calendar.common stock spliton february 28, 2005,
the company effected a two-for-one stock split to shareholders of record as of february 18,
2005. all share and per share information has been retroactively adjusted to
reflect the stock split.financial
instrumentscash equivalents
and short-term investmentsall highly liquid
investments with maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase are
classified as cash equivalents. highly liquid investments with maturities
greater than three months at the date of purchase are classified as short-term
investments. the companys debt and marketable equity securities have been
classified and accounted for as available-for-sale. management
determines the appropriate classification of its investments in debt and
marketable equity securities at the time of purchase and reevaluates the
available-for-sale designations as of each balance sheet date. these securities
are carried at fair value, with the unrealized gains and losses, net of taxes,
reported as a component of shareholders equity. the cost of securities sold is
based upon the specific identification method.derivative
financial instrumentsthe company accounts for its derivative instruments as
either assets or liabilities and carries them at fair value. derivatives that
are not defined as hedges in statement of financial accounting standards (sfas)
no. 133, accounting for derivative instruments and
hedging activities, as amended, must be adjusted to fair value
through earnings. if the derivative is a hedge, depending on the nature of the
hedge,77notes to consolidated financial statements (continued)note 1-summary
of significant accounting policies (continued)changes in fair value will either be offset against
the change in fair value of the hedged assets, liabilities, or firm commitments
through earnings, or recognized in other comprehensive income until the hedged
item is recognized in earnings.for derivative instruments
that hedge the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows that are
designated as cash flow hedges, the effective portion of the gain or loss on
the derivative instrument is reported as a component of accumulated other
comprehensive income in shareholders equity and reclassified into earnings in
the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects
earnings. the ineffective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative
instrument is recognized in current earnings. to receive hedge accounting
treatment, cash flow hedges must be highly effective in offsetting changes to
expected future cash flows on hedged transactions. for derivative instruments
that hedge the exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset or a liability
and that are designated as fair value hedges, the net gain or loss on the
derivative instrument as well as the offsetting gain or loss on the hedged item
attributable to the hedged risk are recognized in earnings in the current
period. the net gain or loss on the effective portion of a derivative
instrument that is designated as an economic hedge of the foreign currency
translation exposure of the net investment in a foreign operation is reported
in the same manner as a foreign currency translation adjustment. for forward contracts
designated as net investment hedges, the company excludes changes in fair value
relating to changes in the forward carry component from its definition of
effectiveness. accordingly, any gains or losses related to this component are
recognized in current earnings.inventoriesinventories are stated at
the lower of cost, computed using the first-in, first-out method, or market. if
the cost of the inventories exceeds their market value, provisions are made
currently for the difference between the cost and the market value. the companys
inventories consist primarily of finished goods for all periods presented.property, plant,
and equipmentproperty, plant, and
equipment are stated at cost. depreciation is computed by use of the straight-line
method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which for buildings is
the lesser of 30 years or the remaining life of the underlying building, up to
5 years for equipment, and the shorter of lease terms or 10 years for leasehold
improvements. the company capitalizes eligible costs to acquire or develop
internal-use software that are incurred subsequent to the preliminary project
stage. capitalized costs related to internal-use software are amortized using
the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which
range from 3 to 5 years. depreciation and amortization expense on property and
equipment was $180 million, $141 million, and $126 million during 2006, 2005,
and 2004, respectively.asset retirement
obligationsthe company records obligations associated with the
retirement of tangible long-lived assets and the associated asset retirement
costs in accordance with sfas no. 143, accounting for asset
retirement obligations. the company reviews legal obligations
associated with the retirement of long-lived assets that result from the
acquisition, construction, development and/or normal use of the assets. if it
is determined that a legal obligation exists, the fair value of the liability
for an asset retirement obligation is recognized in the period in which it is
incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made. the fair value of
the liability is added to the carrying amount of the associated asset and this
additional carrying amount is depreciated over the life of the asset. the
difference between the gross expected future cash flow and its78notes to consolidated financial statements (continued)note 1-summary
of significant accounting policies (continued)present value is accreted over the life of the related
lease as an operating expense. all of the companys existing asset retirement
obligations are associated with commitments to return property subject to
operating leases to original condition upon lease termination.the following table
reconciles changes in the companys asset retirement liabilities for fiscal
2006 and 2005 (in millions):asset retirement
  liability as of september 25, 2004$8.2additional asset retirement obligations recognized2.8accretion recognized0.7asset retirement liability as of september 24,
  2005$11.7additional asset retirement obligations recognized2.5accretion recognized0.5asset retirement
  liability as of september 30, 2006$14.7long-lived
assets including goodwill and other acquired intangible assetsthe company reviews property, plant, and equipment and
certain identifiable intangibles, excluding goodwill, for impairment in
accordance with sfas no. 144, accounting for the
impairment of long-lived assets and for long-lived assets to be disposed of.
long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. recoverability
of these assets is measured by comparison of its carrying amount to future
undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate. if property,
plant, and equipment and certain identifiable intangibles are considered to be
impaired, the impairment to be recognized equals the amount by which the
carrying value of the assets exceeds its fair market value. for the three
fiscal years ended september 30, 2006, the company had no material
impairment of its long-lived assets, except for the impairment of certain
assets in connection with the restructuring actions described in note 6 of
these notes to consolidated financial statements.sfas no. 142, goodwill and other
intangible assets requires that goodwill and intangible assets with
indefinite useful lives should not be amortized but rather be tested for
impairment at least annually or sooner whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate that they may be impaired. the company performs its
goodwill impairment tests on or about august 30 of each year. the company
did not recognize any goodwill or intangible asset impairment charges in 2006,
2005, or 2004. the company established reporting units based on its current
reporting structure. for purposes of testing goodwill for impairment, goodwill
has been allocated to these reporting units to the extent it relates to each
reporting unit.sfas no. 142 also
requires that intangible assets with definite lives be amortized over their
estimated useful lives and reviewed for impairment in accordance with sfas no. 144.
the company is currently amortizing its acquired intangible assets with
definite lives over periods ranging from 3 to 10 years.foreign currency
translationthe company translates the assets and liabilities of
its international non-u.s. functional currency subsidiaries into u.s. dollars
using exchange rates in effect at the end of each period. revenue and expenses
for these subsidiaries are translated using rates that approximate those in
effect during the period. gains and losses from these translations are credited
or charged to foreign currency translation79notes to consolidated financial statements (continued)note 1-summary
of significant accounting policies (continued)included in accumulated
other comprehensive income in shareholders equity. the companys foreign
manufacturing subsidiaries and certain other international subsidiaries that
use the u.s. dollar as their functional currency remeasure monetary assets and
liabilities at exchange rates in effect at the end of each  period, and inventories, property, and
nonmonetary assets and liabilities at historical rates. gains and losses from
these translations were insignificant and have been included in the companys
results of operations.revenue recognitionnet sales consist primarily of revenue from the sale
of hardware, software, peripherals, digital content, and service and support
contracts. the company recognizes revenue pursuant to applicable accounting
standards, including american institute of certified public accountants
statement of position (sop) no. 97-2, software
revenue recognition, as amended, and securities and exchange
commission (sec) staff accounting bulletin (sab) no. 104, revenue recognition.the company recognizes revenue when persuasive
evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the sales price is
fixed or determinable, and collection is probable. product is considered
delivered to the customer once it has been shipped and title and risk of loss
have been transferred. for most of the companys product sales, these criteria
are met at the time the product is shipped. for online sales to individuals,
for some sales to education customers in the u.s., and for certain other sales,
the company defers revenue until the customer receives the product because the
company legally retains a portion of the risk of loss on these sales during
transit. if at the outset of an arrangement the company determines the
arrangement fee is not, or is presumed not to be, fixed or determinable,
revenue is deferred and subsequently recognized as amounts become due and
payable.revenue from service and support contracts is deferred
and recognized ratably over the service coverage periods. these contracts
typically include extended phone support, repair services, web-based support
resources, diagnostic tools, and extend the service coverage offered under the
companys one-year limited warranty.the company sells software and peripheral products
obtained from other companies. the company establishes its own pricing and
retains related inventory risk, is the primary obligor in sales transactions
with its customers, and assumes the credit risk for amounts billed to its
customers. accordingly, the company recognizes revenue for the sale of products
obtained from other companies based on the gross amount billed.revenue on arrangements
that include multiple elements such as hardware, software, and services is
allocated to each element based on the relative fair value of each element.
each elements allocated revenue is recognized when revenue recognition
criteria for that element have been met. fair value is generally determined by
vendor specific objective evidence (vsoe), which is based on the price
charged when each element is sold separately. if the company cannot objectively
determine the fair value of any undelivered element included in a
multiple-element arrangement, the company defers revenue until all elements are
delivered and services have been performed, or until fair value can objectively
be determined for any remaining undelivered elements. when the fair value of a
delivered element has not been established, the company uses the residual method
to recognize revenue if the fair value of all undelivered elements is
determinable. under the residual method, the fair value of the undelivered
elements is deferred and the remaining portion of the arrangement fee is
allocated to the delivered elements and is recognized as revenue.80notes to consolidated financial statements (continued)note 1-summary
of significant accounting policies (continued)the company records reductions to revenue for
estimated commitments related to price protection and for customer incentive
programs, including reseller and end-user rebates, and other sales programs and
volume-based incentives. the estimated cost of these programs is accrued as a
reduction to revenue in the  period the
company has sold the product and committed to a plan. the company also records
reductions to revenue for expected future product returns based on the companys
historical experience.generally, the company
does not offer specified or unspecified upgrade rights to its customers in
connection with software sales or the sale of extended warranty and support
contracts. when the company does offer specified upgrade rights, the company
defers revenue for the fair value of the specified upgrade right until the
future obligation is fulfilled or when the right to the specified upgrade
expires. additionally, a limited number of the companys software products are
available with maintenance agreements that grant customers rights to
unspecified future upgrades over the maintenance term on a when and if
available basis. revenue associated with such maintenance is recognized ratably
over the maintenance term.allowance for
doubtful accountsthe company records its
allowance for doubtful accounts based upon its assessment of various factors. the
company considers historical experience, the age of the accounts receivable
balances, credit quality of the companys customers, current economic
conditions, and other factors that may affect customers ability to pay.shipping costsfor all periods presented,
amounts billed to customers related to shipping and handling are classified as
revenue, and the companys shipping and handling costs are included in cost of
sales.warranty expensethe company provides for
the estimated cost of hardware and software warranties at the time the related
revenue is recognized. the company assesses the adequacy of its preexisting
warranty liabilities and adjusts the amounts as necessary based on actual
experience and changes in future estimates.software
development costsresearch and development costs are expensed as
incurred. development costs of computer software to be sold, leased, or
otherwise marketed are subject to capitalization beginning when a products
technological feasibility has been established and ending when a product is
available for general release to customers pursuant to sfas no. 86, computer software to be sold, leased, or otherwise marketed.
in most instances, the companys products are released soon after technological
feasibility has been established. therefore, costs incurred subsequent to
achievement of technological feasibility are usually not significant, and
generally all software development costs have been immediately expensed.in 2004, the company began
incurring substantial development costs associated with mac os x version 10.4
tiger (tiger) subsequent to achievement of technological feasibility as
evidenced by public demonstration in august 2004 and the subsequent
release of a developer beta version of the product. the company capitalized
approximately $29.7 million and $4.5 million during 2005 and 2004,
respectively, of costs associated with the development of tiger. in accordance
with sfas no. 86, amortization of this asset to cost of sales began in april 2005
when the company began shipping tiger and is being recognized on a
straight-line basis over a three-year estimated useful life.81notes to consolidated financial statements (continued)note 1-summary
of significant accounting policies (continued)during 2004, the company incurred substantial
development costs associated with filemaker pro 7 subsequent to achievement of
technological feasibility as evidenced by public demonstration and release of a
developer beta version, and prior to the release of the final version of the
product in march 2004. therefore, during 2004, the company capitalized
approximately $2.3 million of costs associated with the development of
filemaker pro 7. in accordance with sfas no. 86, amortization of this
asset to cost of sales began in march 2004 when the company began shipping
filemaker pro 7 and is being recognized on a straight-line basis over a
three-year estimated useful life.total amortization related
to capitalized software development costs was $17.8 million, $15.7 million, and
$10.7 million in 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively.advertising costsadvertising costs are
expensed as incurred. advertising expense was $338 million, $287 million, and
$206 million for 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively.stock-based
compensationon september 25, 2005, the company adopted sfas no. 123
(revised 2004) (sfas no. 123r), share-based payment,
which addresses the accounting for stock-based payment transactions in which an
enterprise receives employee services in exchange for (a) equity
instruments of the enterprise or (b) liabilities that are based on the
fair value of the enterprises equity instruments or that may be settled by the
issuance of such equity instruments. in january 2005, the sec issued sab no. 107,
which provides supplemental implementation guidance for sfas no. 123r.
sfas no. 123r eliminates the ability to account for stock-based
compensation transactions using the intrinsic value method under accounting
principles board (apb) opinion no. 25, accounting
for stock issued to employees, and instead generally requires that
such transactions be accounted for using a fair-value-based method. the company
uses the black-scholes-merton (bsm) option-pricing model to determine the
fair-value of stock-based awards under sfas no. 123r, consistent with that
used for pro forma disclosures under sfas no. 123, accounting
for stock-based compensation. the company has elected to use the
modified prospective transition method as permitted by sfas no. 123r and
accordingly prior periods have not been restated to reflect the impact of sfas no. 123r.
the modified prospective transition method requires that stock-based
compensation expense be recorded for all new and unvested stock options,
restricted stock, restricted stock units, and employee stock purchase plan
shares that are ultimately expected to vest as the requisite service is
rendered beginning on september 25, 2005, the first day of the companys
fiscal year 2006. stock-based compensation expense for awards granted prior to september 25,
2005 is based on the grant-date fair-value as determined under the pro forma
provisions of sfas no. 123. the company recognized incremental stock-based
compensation expense of $117 million during 2006 as a result of the adoption of
sfas no. 123r. diluted earnings per common share was reduced by $0.10 for
the year ended september 30, 2006 due to the adoption of sfas
no. 123r. in accordance with sfas no. 123r, beginning in 2006 the
company has presented excess tax benefits from the exercise of stock-based
compensation awards as a financing activity in the consolidated statement of
cash flows.no stock-based
compensation costs have been capitalized as of september 30, 2006. the
income tax benefit related to stock-based compensation expense was $39 million
for the year ended september 30, 2006. as of september 30, 2006,
$375.2 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to stock options
and restricted stock units is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average
period of 2.91 years.82notes to consolidated financial statements (continued)note 1-summary
of significant accounting policies (continued)sfas no. 123r prohibits recognition of a deferred
tax asset for an excess tax benefit that has not been realized. the company
will recognize a benefit from stock-based compensation in equity if an
incremental tax benefit is realized by following the ordering provisions of the
tax law. in addition, the company accounts for the indirect effects of
stock-based compensation on the research tax credit, the foreign tax credit,
and the domestic manufacturing deduction through the income statement.prior to the adoption of sfas no. 123r, the
company measured compensation expense for its employee stock-based compensation
plans using the intrinsic value method prescribed by apb opinion no. 25.
the company applied the disclosure provisions of sfas no. 123 as amended
by sfas no. 148, accounting for stock-based
compensation-transition and disclosure, as if the fair-value-based
method had been applied in measuring compensation expense. under apb opinion no. 25,
when the exercise price of the companys employee stock options was equal to
the market price of the underlying stock on the date of the grant, no
compensation expense was recognized.the following table
illustrates the effect on net income after taxes and net income per common
share as if the company had applied the fair value recognition provisions of
sfas no. 123 to stock-based compensation during 2005 and 2004 (in

regarding stock-based compensation can be found in note 9.earnings per common
sharebasic earnings per common share is computed by
dividing income available to common shareholders by the weighted-average number
of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. diluted earnings per
common share is computed by dividing income available to common shareholders by
the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the
period increased to include the number of additional shares of common stock
that would have been outstanding if the dilutive potential shares of common
stock had been issued. the dilutive effect of outstanding options, restricted
stock, and restricted stock units is reflected in diluted earnings per share by
application of the treasury stock method. under the83notes to consolidated financial statements (continued)note 1-summary
of significant accounting policies (continued)treasury stock method, an increase in the fair market
value of the companys common stock can result in a greater dilutive effect
from outstanding options, restricted stock, and restricted stock units. additionally,
the exercise of employee stock options and the vesting of restricted stock and
restricted stock units can result in a greater dilutive effect on earnings per
share.the following table sets

comprehensive income refers to revenue, expenses, gains, and losses that under
generally accepted accounting principles are recorded as an element of
shareholders equity but are excluded from net income. the companys other
comprehensive income is comprised of foreign currency translation adjustments
from those subsidiaries not using the u.s. dollar as their functional currency,
unrealized gains and losses on marketable securities categorized as
available-for-sale, and net deferred gains and losses on certain derivative instruments
accounted for as cash flow hedges.segment informationthe company reports segment information based on the
management approach. the management approach designates the internal
reporting used by management for making decisions and assessing performance as
the source of the companys reportable segments. information about the
companys products, major customers, and geographic areas on a company-wide
basis is also disclosed.84

consolidated financial statementsthe company is restating its consolidated balance
sheet as of september 24, 2005, and the related consolidated statements of
operations, shareholders equity, and cash flows for each of the fiscal years
ended september 24, 2005 and september 25, 2004, and each of the
quarters in fiscal year 2005.previously filed annual reports on form 10-k
and quarterly reports on form 10-q affected by the restatements have
not been amended and should not be relied on.on june 29, 2006, the company announced that an
internal review had discovered irregularities related to the issuance of
certain stock option grants made between 1997 and 2001, including a grant to
its chief executive officer (ceo) steve jobs. the company also announced that
a special committee of outside directors (special committee) had been formed
and had hired independent counsel to conduct a full investigation of the
companys past stock option granting practices.as a result of the internal review and the independent
investigation, management has concluded, and the audit and finance committee of
the board of directors agrees, that incorrect measurement dates were used for
financial accounting purposes for certain stock option grants made in prior
periods. therefore, the company has recorded additional non-cash stock-based
compensation expense and related tax effects with regard to past stock option
grants, and the company is restating previously filed financial statements in
this form 10-k. these adjustments, after tax, amounted to $4
million, $7 million, and $10 million in fiscal years 2006, 2005 and 2004,
respectively. the adjustment to 2006 was recorded in the fourth quarter of
fiscal year 2006 due to its insignificance.the independent counsel and its forensic accountants (investigative
team) reviewed the facts and circumstances surrounding stock option grants
made on 259 dates. based on a review of the totality of evidence and the
applicable law, the special committee found no misconduct by current
management. the special committees investigation identified a number of grants
for which grant dates were intentionally selected in order to obtain favorable
exercise prices. the terms of these and certain other grants, as discussed
below, were finalized after the originally assigned grant dates. the special
committee concluded that the procedures for granting, accounting for, and
reporting stock option grants did not include sufficient safeguards to prevent
manipulation. although the investigation found that ceo steve jobs was aware or
recommended the selection of some favorable grant dates, he did not receive or financially
benefit from these grants or appreciate the accounting implications. the
special committee also found that the investigation had raised serious concerns
regarding the actions of two former officers in connection with the accounting,
recording and reporting of stock option grants.based on the evidence and findings from the companys
internal review and the special committees independent investigation, an
analysis was performed of the measurement dates for the 42,077 stock option
grants made on 259 dates between october 1996 and january 2003 (the relevant
period). the company believes that the analysis was properly limited to the
relevant period. in addition to analyzing all grants made during the relevant
period, the company sampled certain grants between 1994 and 1997 and found none
that required accounting adjustments. the first grants for which stock-based
compensation expense is required are dated december 29, 1997. the company
also examined grants made after the relevant period and found none that
required accounting adjustments. moreover, in the years after 2002, apple made
significant changes in its stock option granting practices in response to
evolving legal, regulatory and accounting requirements.consistent with the accounting literature and recent
guidance from the securities and exchange commission (sec), the grants during
the relevant period were organized into categories based on grant85notes to consolidated financial statements (continued)note 2-restatement
of consolidated financial statements (continued)type and process by which the grant was finalized. the
company analyzed the evidence related to each category of grants including, but
not limited to, electronic and physical documents, document metadata, and
witness interviews. based on the relevant facts and circumstances, the company
applied the controlling accounting standards to determine, for every grant
within each category, the proper measurement date. if the measurement date is
not the originally assigned grant date, accounting adjustments were made as
required, resulting in stock-based compensation expense and related tax
effects.the 42,077 grants were classified as follows: (1) 17
grants to persons elected or appointed to the board of directors (director
grants); (2) 3,892 grants to employees under the monday/tuesday plan
described below (monday/tuesday grants); (3) 27,096 grants made in
broad-based awards to large numbers of employees, usually on an annual basis (focal
grants); (4) 9,988 other grants ratified at meetings of the board or
compensation committee (meeting grants); (5) 1,082 other grants ratified
by unanimous written consent (uwc) of the board or compensation committee (other
uwc grants); and (6) two grants to the ceo (ceo grants). all references
to the number of option shares, option exercise prices, and share prices in
this note 2 have not been adjusted for any subsequent stock splits.with the exception of director grants, all stock
option grants were subject to ratification by the board or compensation
committee at a meeting or by uwc. following approval of the grants at a meeting
or by uwc, the companys legal staff would prepare a secretarys certificate
certifying the ratification of the grants. based on the facts and circumstances
described below, the company has concluded that the recipients and terms of
certain grants were fixed for accounting purposes before ratification pursuant
to parameters previously approved by the board or compensation committee
through the monday/tuesday plan and the focal process. as further discussed
below, within these parameters, management had the authority to determine the
recipients and terms for each grant. thus, the company has concluded that the
measurement dates for these grants occurred when managements process for
allocating these grants was completed and the grants were ready for
ratification, which was considered perfunctory. with regard to all other
grants, the company has concluded that the grants were finalized and the
measurement dates occurred when the grants were ratified. for many grants,
however, the dates of ratification cannot be established because the dates the uwcs
were executed by the board or compensation committee members or received by the
company are not available. for such grants, the company has concluded that the
date of the preparation of the secretarys certificate is the best alternative
for determining the actual date of ratification.as discussed below, the companys analysis determined
that the originally assigned grant dates for 6,428 grants on 42 dates are not
the proper measurement dates. accordingly, after accounting for forfeitures,
the company has recognized stock-based compensation expense of $105 million on
a pre-tax basis over the respective awards vesting terms. no adjustments were
required for the remaining 35,649 grants. the adjustments were determined by
category as follows:director grants-seventeen director grants were made
during the relevant period. two director grants were made pursuant to a 1997
plan that dated the grants on the enactment of the plan. the remaining fifteen
grants were automatically made under the director stock option plan for
non-employee directors, which was approved by shareholders in 1998, on the date
of a directors election or appointment to the board and on subsequent
anniversaries, beginning on the fourth anniversary. accordingly, the analysis
determined that the originally assigned grant date for each director grant is
the measurement date, and no accounting adjustments are required.86notes to consolidated financial statements (continued)note 2-restatement
of consolidated financial statements (continued)monday/tuesday grants-beginning in december 1998,
3,892 new hire grants and grants for promotion and retention purposes (promotion/retention
grants) were made during the relevant period under the monday/tuesday plan. under
the monday/tuesday plan, new hire grants made within pre-established guidelines
approved by the board or compensation committee were dated on the monday that
the recipient started work (or the following monday, if the recipient started
on another day). the companys analysis showed this process to be reliable with
very low error rates. promotion/retention grants, also based on pre-established
guidelines, were made generally on the first tuesday of each month. the company
has concluded that the new hire and promotion/retention grants made pursuant to
the monday/tuesday plan within pre-established guidelines do not require
adjustment, with the exception of six grants that were erroneously dated before
the employees start dates. for 120 new hire and promotion/retention grants
made outside the guidelines, however, the company has concluded that the
measurement dates are the dates of ratification by the board or compensation
committee rather than the dates used for grants within guidelines. accordingly,
based on the methodology described above, the company has recognized
stock-based compensation expense of $6 million from 126 grants.focal grants-during the relevant period, 27,096 focal
grants were made to employees typically on an annual basis as part of an
extensive process that required several months to complete. pursuant to limits,
guidelines and practices previously approved by the board or compensation committee,
managers throughout the company would make recommendations for grants to
employees in their areas of responsibility. after senior management had
determined that the grants were made in accordance with these established
limits, guidelines and practices, management treated the grants as final when
they were submitted to the board or compensation committee for ratification. the
company has concluded that for 5,595 grants on five dates, the originally
assigned grant dates are not the proper measurement dates. for these grants,
managements process for finalizing the grants was completed after the originally
assigned grant dates. as a result, the company has recognized $29 million of
stock-based compensation expense. for two of the five grant dates comprising
3,744 grants, the evidence shows that the grants were finalized and the
measurement date occurred one day after the originally assigned grant dates. the
grants on these two dates represent more than $16 million of the total $29
million of stock-based compensation expense resulting from focal grants.other meeting grants-during the relevant period,
meetings of the board or compensation committee were held to ratify 9,988
grants that are not monday/tuesday, focal or ceo grants. the grant dates and
measurement dates for these grants are the meeting dates when the grants were
ratified, with the exception of 46 grants. forty-two of these 46 grants are
dated concurrent with a meeting that considered and approved certain grants,
but the evidence indicates that all of the grants may not have been finalized
until a later date. one of the 46 grants was approved and dated at another
meeting, but the recipient, who was becoming employed by the company as part of
a corporate acquisition, did not start until a later date. two other grants
were approved before the employees start dates. another grant was mistakenly
cancelled and subsequently reinstated, requiring an accounting adjustment.
thus, for these 46 grants the company has concluded that the originally assigned
grant dates are not the proper measurement dates. as a result, the company has
recognized $2 million of stock-based compensation expense.other uwc grants-during the relevant period, 1,082
grants were approved by uwcs for a variety of purposes, including executive
recruitment, retention, promotion and new hires outside the monday/tuesday
process. these grants were not made pursuant to pre-established guidelines
adopted by the board or compensation committee. therefore, the company has
concluded that these grants were87notes to consolidated financial statements (continued)note 2-restatement
of consolidated financial statements (continued)not finalized for accounting purposes until
ratification by the board or compensation committee. accordingly, for 660
grants, the company has concluded that the originally assigned grant dates are
not the proper measurement dates. as a result, the company has recognized $48
million of stock-based compensation expense.ceo grants-during the relevant period, the company
made two grants to ceo steve jobs. the first grant, dated january 12,
2000, was for 10 million option shares. the second grant, dated october 19,
2001, was for 7.5 million option shares. both grants were cancelled in march 2003
prior to being exercised, when mr. jobs received 5 million shares of
restricted stock.with respect to the grant dated january 12, 2000,
the board on december 2, 1999, authorized a special ceo compensation
committee to grant mr. jobs up to 15 million shares. the evidence
indicates that the ceo compensation committee finalized the terms of the grant
on january 12, 2000, although the committees action was memorialized in a
uwc transmitted on january 18, 2000. because the measurement date is the originally
assigned grant date, the company has not recognized any stock-based
compensation expense from this grant. if the company had determined that the
measurement date was the date when the uwc was executed or received, then
additional stock-based compensation would have been recognized.the grant dated october 19, 2001 was originally
approved at a board meeting on august 29, 2001, with an exercise price of
$17.83. the terms of the grant, however, were not finalized until december 18,
2001. the grant was dated october 19, 2001, with an exercise price of
$18.30. the approval for the grant was improperly recorded as occurring at a
special board meeting on october 19, 2001. such a special board meeting
did not occur. there was no evidence, however, that any current member of
management was aware of this irregularity. the company has recognized $20
million in stock-based compensation expense for this grant, reflecting the
difference between the exercise price of $18.30 and the share price on december 18,
2001 of $21.01.the incremental impact

investigation of past stock option grants is as follows (dollars in millions):fiscal yearpre-tax

result of such sales. these net gains were included in interest and other

the companys investments during 2006 in u.s. government securities and during
2005 in u.s. government securities, u.s. corporate securities, and foreign
securities were caused primarily by changes in interest rates. the company
typically invests in highly-rated securities with low probabilities of default.
the companys investment policy requires investments to be rated single-a or
better. therefore, the company considers the declines to be temporary in nature.
as of september 30, 2006, the company does not consider the investments to
be other-than-temporarily impaired.market values were
determined for each individual security in the investment portfolio. when
evaluating the investments for other-than-temporary impairment, the company
reviews factors such as the length of time and extent to which fair value has
been below cost basis, the financial condition of the issuer, and the companys
ability and intent to hold the investment for a period of time, which may be
sufficient for anticipated recovery in market value.92notes to consolidated financial statements (continued)note 3-financial
instruments (continued)accounts receivabletrade receivablesthe company distributes its products through
third-party distributors and resellers and directly to certain education,
consumer, and commercial customers. the company generally does not require
collateral from its customers; however, the company will require collateral in
certain instances to limit credit risk. in addition, when possible, the company
does attempt to limit credit risk on trade receivables with credit insurance
for certain customers in latin america, europe, asia, and australia and by
arranging with third-party financing companies to provide flooring arrangements
and other loan and lease programs to the companys direct customers. these
credit-financing arrangements are directly between the third-party financing
company and the end customer. as such, the company generally does not assume
any recourse or credit risk sharing related to any of these arrangements.
however, considerable trade receivables that are not covered by collateral,
third-party flooring arrangements, or credit insurance are outstanding with the
companys distribution and retail channel partners. no customer accounted for
more than 10% of trade receivables as of september 30, 2006 or september 24,

receivablesthe company has non-trade
receivables from certain of its manufacturing vendors resulting from the sale
of raw material components to these manufacturing vendors who manufacture
sub-assemblies or assemble final products for the company. the company
purchases these raw material components directly from suppliers. these
non-trade receivables, which are included in the consolidated balance sheets in
other current assets, totaled $1.6 billion and $417 million as of september 30,
2006 and september 24, 2005, respectively. the company does not reflect
the sale of these components in net sales and does not recognize any profits on
these sales until the products are sold through to the end customer at which
time the profit is recognized as a reduction of cost of sales.derivative
financial instrumentsthe company uses derivatives to partially offset its
business exposure to foreign exchange risk. foreign currency forward and option
contracts are used to offset the foreign exchange risk on certain existing
assets and liabilities and to hedge the foreign exchange risk on expected
future cash flows on certain forecasted revenue and cost of sales. from time to
time, the company enters into interest rate derivative agreements to modify the
interest rate profile of certain investments and debt. the companys accounting
policies for these instruments are based on whether the instruments are
designated as hedge or non-hedge instruments. the company records all
derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value.93notes to consolidated financial statements (continued)note 3-financial

instruments provide one measure of the transaction volume outstanding as of

or market loss. the credit risk amounts shown in the table above represents the
companys gross exposure to potential accounting loss on these transactions if
all counterparties failed to perform according to the terms of the contract,
based on then-current currency exchange rates at each respective date.
the companys exposure to credit loss and market risk will vary over time as a
function of currency exchange rates.the estimates of fair
value are based on applicable and commonly used pricing models and prevailing
financial market information as of september 30, 2006 and september 24,
2005. although the table above reflects the notional principal, fair value, and
credit risk amounts of the companys foreign exchange instruments, it does not
reflect the gains or losses associated with the exposures and transactions that
the foreign exchange instruments are intended to hedge. the amounts ultimately
realized upon settlement of these financial instruments, together with the
gains and losses on the underlying exposures, will depend on actual market
conditions during the remaining life of the instruments.foreign exchange
risk managementthe company may enter into foreign currency forward
and option contracts with financial institutions to protect against foreign
exchange risk associated with existing assets and liabilities, certain firmly
committed transactions, forecasted future cash flows, and net investments in
foreign subsidiaries. generally, the companys practice is to hedge a majority
of its existing material foreign exchange transaction exposures. however, the
company may not hedge certain foreign exchange transaction exposures due to
immateriality, prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures, or
limited availability of appropriate hedging instruments.to help protect gross margins from fluctuations in
foreign currency exchange rates, the companys u.s. dollar functional
subsidiaries hedge a portion of forecasted foreign currency revenue, and the
companys non-u.s. dollar functional subsidiaries selling in local currencies
hedge a portion of forecasted inventory purchases not denominated in the
subsidiaries functional currency. other comprehensive income94notes to consolidated financial statements (continued)note 3-financial
instruments (continued)associated with hedges of foreign currency revenue is
recognized as a component of net sales in the same period as the related sales
are recognized, and other comprehensive income related to inventory purchases
is recognized as a component of cost of sales in the same period as the related
costs are recognized. typically, the company hedges portions of its forecasted
foreign currency exposure associated with revenue and inventory purchases over
a time horizon of up to 6 months.derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges
must be de-designated as hedges when it is probable that the forecasted hedged
transaction will not occur in the initially identified time period or within a
subsequent 2 month time period. deferred gains and losses in other
comprehensive income associated with such derivative instruments are
immediately reclassified into earnings in other income and expense. any
subsequent changes in fair value of such derivative instruments are also
reflected in current earnings unless they are re-designated as hedges of other
transactions. the company recognized a net gain of approximately $421,000 in
2006 and net losses of $1.6 million and $2.8 million in 2005 and 2004,
respectively, in other income and expense related to the loss of hedge
designation on discontinued cash flow hedges due to changes in the companys
forecast of future net sales and cost of sales and due to prevailing market
conditions. as of september 30, 2006, the company had a net deferred gain
associated with cash flow hedges of approximately $2.8 million, net of taxes,
substantially all of which is expected to be reclassified to earnings by the
end of the second quarter of fiscal 2007.the net gain or loss on the effective portion of a
derivative instrument designated as a net investment hedge is included in the
cumulative translation adjustment account of accumulated other comprehensive
income within shareholders equity. for the years ended september 30, 2006
and september 24, 2005, the company had net gains of $7.4 million and
$673,000, respectively, included in the cumulative translation adjustment.the company may also enter
into foreign currency forward and option contracts to offset the foreign
exchange gains and losses generated by the re-measurement of certain assets and
liabilities recorded in non-functional currencies. changes in the fair value of
these derivatives are recognized in current earnings in other income and
expense as offsets to the changes in the fair value of the related assets or
liabilities. due to currency market movements, changes in option time value can
lead to increased volatility in other income and expense.note 4-consolidated

years and 5.5 years, respectively.during 2006, the company sold certain assets related
to its powerschool web-based student information system operations. in
connection with this sale, the company reduced goodwill by $31 million for the
outstanding balance from the acquisition of powerschool, inc. in 2001 and
recognized a $4 million pre-tax gain, which is reflected in other income and
expense in the consolidated statement of operations.during 2005, the company recorded an adjustment of
approximately $11 million to goodwill relating to a reduction of valuation
allowances that were recorded at the time certain net operating loss
carryforwards (nols) were acquired in previous business combinations. during
2005, these nols were deemed to be more likely than not to be realized and
accordingly the valuation allowances were reversed against the related goodwill
that was recognized at the time of the acquisitions.97

note 2, restatement of consolidated financial statements.the foreign provision for income taxes is based on
foreign pretax earnings of approximately $1.5 billion, $922 million, and $384
million in 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively. as of september 30, 2006,98notes to consolidated financial statements (continued)note 7-income
taxes (continued)approximately $4.1 billion of the companys cash, cash
equivalents, and short-term investments were held by foreign subsidiaries
and are generally based in u.s. dollar-denominated holdings. amounts held
by foreign subsidiaries are generally subject to u.s. income taxation on
repatriation to the u.s. the companys consolidated financial statements
provide for any related tax liability on amounts that may be repatriated, aside
from undistributed earnings of certain of the companys foreign subsidiaries
that are intended to be indefinitely reinvested in operations outside the u.s.
u.s. income taxes have not been provided on a cumulative total of $823 million
of such earnings. it is not practicable to determine the income tax liability
that might be incurred if these earnings were to be distributed.on october 22, 2004, the american jobs creation
act of 2004 (ajca) was signed into law. the ajca included a provision for the
deduction of 85% of certain foreign earnings that were repatriated, as defined
in the ajca, within a specified time frame. among other requirements, dividends
qualifying for the 85% deduction must be reinvested in the united states in
certain qualified investments pursuant to a domestic reinvestment plan approved
by the chief executive officer (ceo) and board of directors. during 2006, the
company repatriated approximately $1.6 billion of foreign earnings. of the
earnings repatriated, $755 million is eligible for the reduced tax rate
provided by the ajca. accordingly, the company recorded a tax charge of $51
million related to the repatriation of foreign earnings under the provisions of
the ajca. in addition, the company recorded a tax benefit of $71 million
resulting from the implementation of tax planning strategies to recognize
deferred tax assets that were previously not recognizable within certain
foreign subsidiaries.deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect the
effects of tax losses, credits, and the future income tax effects of temporary
differences between the consolidated financial statement carrying amounts of
existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and are measured
using enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in the years in which
those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.as of september 30,

2005, a valuation allowance of $5 million was recorded against the deferred tax
asset for the benefits of state operating losses that may not be realized. management
believes it is more likely than not that forecasted income, including income
that may be generated as a result of certain tax planning strategies, together
with the tax effects of the deferred tax liabilities, will be sufficient to
fully recover the remaining deferred tax assets.a
reconciliation of the provision for income taxes, with the amount computed by
applying the statutory federal income tax rate (35% in 2006, 2005, and 2004) to
income before provision for income taxes, is as follows (in millions):200620052004as restated (1)as restated (1)computed expected

note 2, restatement of consolidated financial statements.the companys income taxes
payable has been reduced by the tax benefits from employee stock options. the
company receives an income tax benefit calculated as the difference between the
fair market value of the stock issued at the time of the exercise and the
option price, tax effected. the net tax benefits from employee stock option
transactions were $419 million, $428 million (as restated(1)), and $83 million
(as restated(1)) in 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively, and were reflected as
an increase to common stock in the consolidated statements of shareholders
equity.100notes to consolidated financial statements (continued)note 7-income
taxes (continued)the internal revenue
service (irs) has substantially completed its field audit of the companys
federal income tax returns for the years 2002 through 2003 and proposed certain
adjustments. the company intends to contest certain of these adjustments
through the irs appeals office. substantially all irs audit issues for years
prior to 2002 have been resolved. in addition, the company is also subject to
audits by state, local, and foreign tax authorities. management believes that
adequate provisions have been made for any adjustments that may result from tax
examinations. however, the outcome of tax audits cannot be predicted with
certainty. should any issues addressed in the companys tax audits be resolved
in a manner not consistent with managements expectations, the company could be
required to adjust its provision for income tax in the period such resolution
occurs. in 2006, the company recorded a tax benefit of $20 million due to
the settlement of prior year tax audits in the u.s.note 8-shareholders
equitypreferred stockthe company has five
million shares of authorized preferred stock, none of which is outstanding.
under the terms of the companys restated articles of incorporation, the board
of directors is authorized to determine or alter the rights, preferences,
privileges, and restrictions of the companys authorized but unissued shares of
preferred stock.restricted stock unitsthe companys board of directors has granted
restricted stock units to members of the companys senior management team,
excluding its ceo. these restricted stock units generally vest over four years
either at the end of the four-year service period, in two equal installments on
the second and fourth anniversaries of the date of grant, or in equal
installments on each of the first through fourth anniversaries of the grant
date. upon vesting, the restricted stock units will convert into an equivalent
number of shares of common stock. the amounts of the restricted stock units
expensed by the company are based on the closing market price of the companys
common stock on the date of grant and are amortized on a straight-line basis
over the four-year requisite service period. the restricted stock units have
been reflected in the calculation of diluted earnings per share utilizing the
treasury stock method.2.47 million previously
granted restricted stock units vested during 2006. a majority of these vested
restricted stock units were net-share settled such that the company withheld
shares with value equivalent to the employees minimum statutory obligation for
the applicable income and other employment taxes, and remitted the cash to the
appropriate taxing authorities. the total shares withheld of 985,833 for 2006
was based on the value of the restricted stock units on their vesting date as
determined by the companys closing stock price. total payments for the
employees tax obligations to the taxing authorities were approximately $59 million.
these net-share settlements had the effect of share repurchases by the company
as they reduced and retired the number of shares that would have otherwise been
issued as a result of the vesting and did not represent an expense to the
company.ceo restricted stock awardon march 19, 2003,
the companys board of directors granted 10 million shares of restricted stock
to the companys ceo that vested on march 19, 2006. the amount of the
restricted stock award expensed by the company was based on the closing market
price of the companys common stock on the date of grant and was amortized on a
straight-line basis over the three-year requisite service period.101notes to consolidated financial statements (continued)note 8-shareholders
equity (continued)upon vesting during 2006,
the restricted stock award was net-share settled such that the company withheld
shares with value equivalent to the ceos minimum statutory obligation for the
applicable income and other employment taxes, and remitted the cash to the
appropriate taxing authorities. the total shares withheld of 4.6 million was
based on the value of the restricted stock award on the vesting date as
determined by the companys closing stock price of $64.66. the remaining shares
net of those withheld were delivered to the companys ceo. total payments for
the ceos tax obligations to the taxing authorities were approximately $296
million. the net-share settlement had the effect of share repurchases by the
company as it reduced and retired the number of shares outstanding and did not
represent an expense to the company.stock repurchase planin july 1999, the
companys board of directors authorized a plan for the company to repurchase up
to $500 million of its common stock. this repurchase plan does not obligate the
company to acquire any specific number of shares or acquire shares over any
specified period of time. the company has repurchased a total of 13.1 million
shares at a cost of $217 million under this plan and was authorized to
repurchase up to an additional $283 million of its common stock as of september 30,
2006.comprehensive incomecomprehensive income consists of two components: net
income and other comprehensive income. other comprehensive income refers to
revenue, expenses, gains, and losses that under u.s. generally accepted
accounting principles are recorded as an element of shareholders equity but
are excluded from net income. the companys other comprehensive income consists
of foreign currency translation adjustments from those subsidiaries not using
the u.s. dollar as their functional currency, unrealized gains and losses on
marketable securities categorized as available-for-sale, and net deferred gains
and losses on certain derivative instruments accounted for as cash flow hedges.the

plan (the 2003 plan) is a shareholder approved plan that provides for
broad-based grants to employees, including executive officers. based on the
terms of individual option grants, options granted under the 2003 plan
generally expire 7 to 10 years after the grant date and generally become
exercisable over a period of 4 years, based on continued employment, with
either annual or quarterly vesting. the 2003 plan permits the granting of
incentive stock options, nonstatutory stock options, restricted stock units,
stock appreciation rights, and stock purchase rights.1997 employee stock option planin august 1997, the
companys board of directors approved the 1997 employee stock option plan (the 1997
plan), a non-shareholder approved plan for grants of stock options to employees
who are not officers of the company. based on the terms of individual option
grants, options granted under the 1997 plan generally expire 7 to 10 years
after the grant date and generally become exercisable over a period of 4 years,
based on continued employment, with either annual or quarterly vesting. in october 2003,
the company terminated the 1997 employee stock option plan and cancelled all
remaining unissued shares totaling 28,590,702. no new options can be granted
from the 1997 plan.employee stock option exchange programon march 20, 2003,
the company announced a voluntary employee stock option exchange program (the exchange
program) whereby eligible employees, other than executive officers and members
of the board of directors, had an opportunity to exchange outstanding options
with exercise prices at or above $12.50 per share for a predetermined smaller
number of new stock options issued with exercise prices equal to the fair
market value of one share of the companys common stock on the day the new
awards were issued, which was to be at least six months plus one day after the
exchange options were cancelled. on april 17, 2003, in accordance with the
exchange program, the company cancelled options to purchase 33,138,386 shares
of its common stock. on october 22, 2003, new stock options totaling
13,394,736 shares were issued to employees at an exercise price of $11.38 per
share, which is equivalent to the closing price of the companys stock on that
date. no financial or accounting impact to the companys financial position,
results of operations or cash flows was associated with this transaction.103notes to consolidated financial statements (continued)note 8-shareholders equity (continued)1997 director stock option planin august 1997, the
companys board of directors adopted a director stock option plan (director
plan) for non-employee directors of the company, which was approved by
shareholders in 1998. pursuant to the
director plan, the companys non-employee directors are granted an option to
acquire 30,000 shares of common stock upon their initial election to the board
(initial options). the initial options vest and
become exercisable in three equal annual installments on each of the first
through third anniversaries of the grant date. on the fourth anniversary of a
non-employee directors initial election to the board and on each subsequent
anniversary thereafter, the director will be entitled to receive an option to
acquire 10,000 shares of common stock (annual options). annual options are
fully vested and immediately exercisable on their date of grant.rule 10b5-1 trading planscertain of the companys
executive officers, including mr. timothy d. cook, mr. peter
oppenheimer, mr. philip w. schiller, and dr. bertrand serlet, have
entered into trading plans pursuant to rule 10b5-1(c)(1) of the
securities exchange act of 1934, as amended. a trading plan is a written
document that pre-establishes the amounts, prices and dates (or formula for
determining the amounts, prices and dates) of future purchases or sales of the
companys stock including the exercise and sale of employee stock options and
shares acquired pursuant to the companys employee stock purchase plan and upon
vesting of restricted stock units.employee stock purchase planthe company has a
shareholder approved employee stock purchase plan (the purchase plan), under
which substantially all employees may purchase common stock through payroll
deductions at a price equal to 85% of the lower of the fair market values as of
the beginning and end of six month offering periods. stock purchases under the
purchase plan are limited to 10% of an employees compensation, up to a maximum
of $25,000 in any calendar year. the number of shares authorized for issuance
is limited to a total of 1 million shares per offering period. during 2006,
2005, and 2004, adjusted for the february 2005 stock split, 1.5 million,
2.3 million, and 3.9 million shares, respectively, were issued under the
purchase plan. as of september 30, 2006, approximately 2.3 million shares
were reserved for future issuance under the purchase plan.employee savings planthe company has an employee savings plan (the savings
plan) qualifying as a deferred salary arrangement under
section 401(k) of the internal revenue code. under the savings plan,
participating u.s. employees may defer a portion of their pre-tax earnings, up
to the internal revenue service annual contribution limit ($15,000 for calendar
year 2006). the company matches 50% to 100% of each employees contributions,
depending on length of service, up to a maximum 6% of the employees earnings.
the companys matching contributions to the savings plan were approximately $33
million, $28 million, and $24 million in 2006, 2005, and 2004,
respectively.104

commensurate with the estimated expected life of the companys stock options
and other relevant factors including implied volatility in market traded
options on the companys common stock. the company bases its expected life

and indemnificationsthe company offers a basic limited parts and labor
warranty on its hardware products. the basic warranty period for hardware
products is typically one year from the date of purchase by the end-user. the
company also offers a 90-day basic warranty for its service parts used to
repair the companys hardware products. the company provides currently for the
estimated cost that may be incurred under its basic limited product warranties
at the time related revenue is recognized. factors considered in determining
appropriate accruals for product warranty obligations include the size of the
installed base of products subject to warranty protection, historical and
projected warranty claim rates, historical and projected cost-per-claim, and
knowledge of specific product failures that are outside of the companys
typical experience. the company assesses the adequacy of its preexisting
warranty liabilities and adjusts the amounts as necessary based on actual
experience and changes in future estimates.the company periodically provides updates to its
applications and system software to maintain the softwares compliance with
specifications. the estimated cost to develop such updates is accounted for as
warranty costs that are recognized at the time related software revenue is
recognized. factors considered in determining appropriate accruals related to
such updates include the number of units delivered, the number of updates
expected to occur, and the historical cost and estimated future cost of the
resources necessary to develop these updates.the

and contingencies (continued)the
company generally does not indemnify end-users of its operating system and
application software against legal claims that the software infringes
third-party intellectual property rights. other agreements entered into by the
company sometimes include indemnification provisions under which the company
could be subject to costs and/or damages in the event of an infringement claim
against the company or an indemnified third-party. however, the company has not
been required to make any significant payments resulting from such an
infringement claim asserted against itself or an indemnified third-party and,
in the opinion of management, does not have a potential liability related to
unresolved infringement claims subject to indemnification that would have a
material adverse effect on its financial condition, liquidity or results of
operations. therefore, the company did not record a liability for infringement
costs as of either september 30, 2006 or september 24, 2005.concentrations in
the available sources of supply of materials and productalthough most components
essential to the companys business are generally available from multiple
sources, other key components (including microprocessors and application-specific
integrated circuits (asics)) are currently obtained by the company from
single or limited sources. some other key components, while currently available
to the company from multiple sources, are at times subject to industry-wide
availability and pricing pressures. in addition, the company uses some
components that are not common to the rest of the personal computer industry,
and new products introduced by the company often initially utilize custom
components obtained from only one source until the company has evaluated
whether there is a need for and subsequently qualifies additional suppliers. if
the supply of a key single-sourced component to the company were to be
delayed or curtailed, or in the event a key manufacturing vendor delays
shipments of completed products to the company, the companys ability to ship
related products in desired quantities and in a timely manner could be adversely
affected. the companys business and financial performance could also be
adversely affected depending on the time required to obtain sufficient
quantities from the original source, or to identify and obtain sufficient
quantities from an alternative source. continued availability of these
components may be affected if producers were to decide to concentrate on the
production of common components instead of components customized to meet the
companys requirements. finally, significant portions of the companys cpus,
logic boards, and assembled products are now manufactured by outsourcing
partners, primarily in various parts of asia. although the company works
closely with its outsourcing partners on manufacturing schedules, the companys
operating results could be adversely affected if its outsourcing partners were
unable to meet their production obligations.long-term supply
agreementsduring 2006, the company
entered into long-term supply agreements with hynix semiconductor, inc.,
intel corporation, micron technology, inc., samsung electronics co., ltd.,
and toshiba corporation to secure supply of nand flash memory through calendar
year 2010. as part of these agreements, the company prepaid $1.25 billion for
flash memory components during 2006. these prepayments will be applied to
inventory purchases made over the life of each respective agreement.contingenciesthe company is subject to certain other legal
proceedings and claims that have arisen in the ordinary course of business and
have not been fully adjudicated. in the opinion of management, the company does
not have a potential liability related to any current legal proceedings and
claims that would individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse
effect on its financial condition, liquidity, or results of operations.108notes to consolidated financial statements (continued)note 10-commitments
and contingencies (continued)however, the results of legal proceedings cannot be
predicted with certainty. should the company fail to prevail in any of these
legal matters or should several of these legal matters be resolved against the
company in the same reporting period, the operating results of a particular
reporting period could be materially adversely affected.production and marketing
of products in certain states and countries may subject the company to
environmental and other regulations including, in some instances, the
requirement to provide customers the ability to return product at the end of
its useful life, and place responsibility for environmentally safe disposal or
recycling with the company. such laws and regulations have recently been passed
in several jurisdictions in which the company operates including various
european union member countries, japan and certain states within the u.s. although
the company does not anticipate any material adverse effects in the future
based on the nature of its operations and the thrust of such laws, there is no
assurance that such existing laws or future laws will not have a material
adverse effect on the companys financial condition, liquidity, or results of
operations.note 11-segment
information and geographic datain accordance with sfas no. 131, disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information,
the company reports segment information based on the management approach. the
management approach designates the internal reporting used by management for
making decisions and assessing performance as the source of the companys
reportable segments.the company manages its business primarily on a geographic
basis. the companys reportable operating segments are comprised of the
americas, europe, japan, and retail. the americas, europe, and japan reportable
segments do not include activities related to the retail segment. the americas
segment includes both north and south america. the europe segment includes
european countries as well as the middle east and africa. the retail segment
operates apple-owned retail stores in the u.s., canada, japan, and the u.k. other
operating segments include asia-pacific, which includes australia and asia
except for japan, and the companys subsidiary, filemaker, inc. each
reportable geographic operating segment provides similar hardware and software
products and similar services, and the accounting policies of the various
segments are the same as those described in note 1, summary of significant
accounting policies, except as described below for the retail segment.the company evaluates the performance of its operating
segments based on net sales. the retail segments performance is also evaluated
based on operating income. net sales for geographic segments are generally
based on the location of the customers. operating income for each segment
includes net sales to third parties, related cost of sales, and operating expenses
directly attributable to the segment. operating income for each segment
excludes other income and expense and certain expenses that are managed outside
the operating segments. costs excluded from segment operating income include
various corporate expenses such as manufacturing costs and variances not
included in standard costs, research and development, corporate marketing
expenses, stock-based compensation expense, income taxes, various nonrecurring
charges, and other separately managed general and administrative expenses
including certain corporate expenses associated with support of the retail
segment. the company does not include intercompany transfers between segments
for management reporting purposes. segment assets exclude corporate assets.
corporate assets include cash, short-term and long-term investments,
manufacturing facilities, miscellaneous corporate infrastructure, goodwill and
other acquired intangible assets, and retail store construction-in-progress
that is not subject to depreciation. except for the retail segment, capital109notes to consolidated financial statements (continued)note 11-segment
information and geographic data (continued)expenditures for long-lived assets are not reported to
management by segment. capital expenditures by the retail segment were $200
million, $132 million, and $104 million for 2006, 2005, and 2004,
respectively.operating income for all segments, except retail, includes cost of
sales at manufacturing standard cost, other cost of sales, related sales and
marketing costs, and certain general and administrative costs. this measure of
operating income, which includes manufacturing profit, provides a comparable
basis for comparison between the companys various geographic segments. certain
manufacturing expenses and related adjustments not included in segment cost of
sales, including variances between standard and actual manufacturing costs and
the mark-up above standard cost for product supplied to the retail segment, are
included in corporate expenses.management assesses the operating performance of the
retail segment differently than it assesses the operating performance of the
companys geographic segments. the retail segment revenue and operating income
is intended to depict a measure comparable to that of the companys major
channel partners in the u.s. operating retail stores so the company can
evaluate the retail segment performance as if it were a channel partner.
therefore, the company makes three significant adjustments to the retail
segment for management reporting purposes that are not included in the results
of the companys other segments.first, the retail segments operating income includes
cost of sales for apple products at an amount normally charged to major channel
partners in the u.s. operating retail stores, less the cost of sales programs
and incentives provided to those channel partners and the companys cost to
support those partners. for the years ended september 30, 2006, september 24,
2005, and september 25, 2004, this resulted in the recognition of
additional cost of sales above standard cost by the retail segment and an
offsetting benefit to corporate expenses of approximately $663 million, $435
million, and $213 million, respectively.second, the companys service and support contracts
are transferred to the retail segment at the same cost as that charged to the
companys major retail channel partners in the u.s., resulting in a measure of
revenue and gross margin for those items that is comparable between the companys
retail stores and those retail channel partners. the retail segment recognizes
the full amount of revenue and cost of sales of the companys service and
support contracts at the time of sale. because the company has not yet earned
the revenue or incurred the costs associated with the sale of these contracts,
an offset to these amounts is recognized in other operating segments net sales
and cost of sales. for the year ended september 30, 2006, this resulted in
the recognition of net sales and cost of sales by the retail segment, with
corresponding offsets in other operating segments, of $159 million and $109
million, respectively. for the year ended september 24, 2005, this
resulted in the recognition of net sales and cost of sales by the retail
segment of $92 million and $64 million, respectively. for the year ended september 25,
2004, this resulted in the recognition of net sales and cost of sales by the
retail segment of $54 million and $37 million, respectively.third, the company had opened a total of eight
high-profile stores as of september 30, 2006. these high-profile stores
are larger than the companys typical retail stores and were designed to
further promote brand awareness and provide a venue for certain corporate sales
and marketing activities, including corporate briefings. as such, the company
allocates certain operating expenses associated with these stores to corporate
marketing expense to reflect the estimated benefit realized company-wide. the
allocation of these operating costs is based on the amount incurred for a high-profile
store in excess of that incurred by a more typical company retail location.
expenses allocated to corporate marketing resulting110notes to consolidated financial statements (continued)note 11-segment
information and geographic data (continued)from the operations
of these stores were $33 million, $31 million, and $16 million for the years
ended september 30, 2006, september 24, 2005, and september 25,
2004, respectively.summary information by operating segment follows (in

operations, shareholders equity and cash flows for each of the years in the
three-year period ended september 30, 2006. these consolidated financial
statements are the responsibility of the companys management. our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial
statements based on our audits.we conducted our audits in accordance with the
standards of the public company accounting oversight board (united states). those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of
material misstatement. an audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial
statements. an audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. we believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.in our opinion, the consolidated financial statements
referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
position of the company as of september 30, 2006 and september 24,
2005, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the

of independent registered public accounting firmthe board of directors and shareholders
apple computer, inc.:we have audited managements assessment, included in
the accompanying managements annual report on internal control over financial
reporting, that apple computer, inc. and subsidiaries maintained effective
internal control over financial reporting as of september 30, 2006, based
on criteria established in internal control-integrated
framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the
treadway commission (coso). apple computer, inc.s management is
responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting
and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial
reporting. our responsibility is to express an opinion on managements
assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the apple computer, inc.s
internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.we conducted our audit in accordance with the
standards of the public company accounting oversight board (united states).
those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was
maintained in all material respects. our audit included obtaining an
understanding of internal control over financial reporting, evaluating
managements assessment, testing and evaluating the design and operating
effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other procedures as we
considered necessary in the circumstances. we believe that our audit provides a
reasonable basis for our opinion.a companys internal control over financial reporting
is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability
of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external
purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. a companys
internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and
procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in
reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and
dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable
assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of
financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made
only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the
company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or
timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.because of inherent limitations, internal control over
financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. also, projections
of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk
that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that
the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.in our opinion, managements assessment that apple
computer, inc. maintained effective internal control over financial
reporting as of september 30, 2006, is fairly stated, in all material
respects, based on criteria established in internal
control-integrated framework issued by coso. also, in our opinion,
apple computer, inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective
internal control over financial reporting as of september 30, 2006, based

control-integrated framework issued by coso.we also have audited, in
accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board
(united states), the consolidated balance sheets of apple computer, inc.
as of september 30, 2006 and september 24, 2005, and the related
consolidated statements of operations, shareholders equity, and cash flows for
each of the years in the three-year period ended september 30, 2006, and
our report dated december 29, 2006 expressed an unqualified opinion on
those consolidated financial statements./s/ kpmg llpmountain view,
