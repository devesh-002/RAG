## Item 1A


in the event of
renewed financial turmoil affecting the banking system and financial markets, additional consolidation of the financial services industry, or significant financial service institution failures, there could be a new or incremental tightening in
the credit markets, low liquidity, and extreme volatility in fixed income, credit, currency, and equity markets. in addition, the risk remains that there could be a number of follow-on effects from the credit crisis on the
companys business, including the insolvency of key outsourced manufacturing partners or suppliers or their inability to obtain credit to finance development and/or manufacture products resulting in product delays; inability of customers,
including channel partners, to obtain credit to finance purchases of the companys products and/or customer, including channel partner, insolvencies; and failure of derivative counterparties and other financial institutions negatively
impacting the companys treasury operations. other income and expense also could vary materially from expectations depending on gains or losses realized on the sale or exchange of financial instruments; impairment charges resulting
from revaluations of debt and equity securities and other investments; interest rates; cash balances; and changes in fair value of derivative instruments. increased volatility in the financial markets and overall
economic uncertainty would increase the risk of the actual amounts realized in the future on the companys financial instruments differing significantly from the fair values currently assigned to them.uncertainty about current global economic conditions could also continue to increase the volatility of the companys stock price.global markets for the companys products and services are highly competitive and subject to rapid technological
change. if the company is unable to compete effectively in these markets, its financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected.the company competes in highly competitive global markets characterized by aggressive price cutting, with resulting downward pressure on gross margins, frequent introduction of new products, short product
life cycles, evolving industry standards, continual improvement in product price/performance characteristics, rapid adoption of technological and product advancements by competitors, and price sensitivity on the part of consumers.the companys ability to compete successfully depends heavily on its ability to ensure a continuing and timely introduction of
innovative new products and technologies to the marketplace. the company believes it is unique in that it designs and develops nearly the entire solution for its products, including the hardware, operating system, numerous software applications, and
related services. as a result, the company must make significant investments in research and development and as such, the company currently holds a significant number of patents and copyrights and has registered and/or has applied to register
numerous patents, trademarks and service marks. by contrast, many of the companys competitors seek to compete primarily through aggressive pricing and very low cost structures. if the company is unable to continue to develop and sell
innovative new products with attractive margins or if other companies infringe on the companys intellectual property, the companys ability to maintain a competitive advantage could be negatively affected and its financial condition and
operating results could be materially adversely affected.in the market for personal computers and peripherals, the company
faces a significant number of competitors, many of which have broader product lines, lower priced products, and larger installed customer bases. consolidation in this market has resulted in larger and potentially stronger competitors. price
competition has been particularly intense as competitors selling windows-based personal computers have aggressively cut prices and lowered product margins. the company also faces increased competition in key market segments, including consumer, smb,
education, enterprise, government and creative markets. an increasing number of internet devices that include software applications and are smaller and simpler than traditional personal computers compete for market share with the companys
existing products.the company is currently the only authorized maker of hardware using the mac os. the mac os has a minority
market share in the personal computer market, which is dominated by computer makers using competing operating systems, most notably windows. the companys financial condition and operating results depend substantially on the companys
ability to continually improve the mac platform to maintain functional and11



design advantages. use of unauthorized copies of the mac os on other companies hardware products may result in decreased demand for the companys hardware products, and could
materially adversely affect the companys financial condition and operating results.the company currently markets
certain mobile communication and media devices, and third-party digital content and applications. the company faces substantial competition from companies that have significant technical, marketing, distribution and other resources, as well as
established hardware, software and digital content supplier relationships. additionally, the company faces significant price competition as competitors reduce their selling prices and attempt to imitate the companys product features and
applications within their own products or, alternatively, collaborate with each other to offer solutions that are more competitive than those they currently offer. the company also competes with illegitimate ways to obtain third-party digital
content and applications. the company has only recently entered the mobile communications and media device markets, and many of its competitors in these markets have significantly greater experience, product breadth and distribution channels than
the company. because some current and potential competitors have substantial resources and/or experience and a lower cost structure, they may be able to provide such products and services at little or no profit or even at a loss. the company also
expects competition to intensify as competitors attempt to imitate the companys approach to providing these components seamlessly within their individual offerings or work collaboratively to offer integrated solutions.the company currently receives subsidies from its exclusive and non-exclusive carriers providing cellular network service for iphone.
there is no assurance that such subsidies will be continued at all or in the same amounts upon renewal of the companys agreements with these carriers or in agreements the company enters into with new carriers.there can be no assurance the company will be able to continue to provide products and services that compete effectively.to remain competitive and stimulate customer demand, the company must successfully manage frequent product introductions and
transitions.due to the highly volatile and competitive nature of the industries in which the company competes, the
company must continually introduce new products, services and technologies, enhance existing products and services, and effectively stimulate customer demand for new and upgraded products. the success of new product introductions depends on a number
of factors including but not limited to timely and successful product development, market acceptance, the companys ability to manage the risks associated with new products and production ramp issues, the availability of application software
for new products, the effective management of purchase commitments and inventory levels in line with anticipated product demand, the availability of products in appropriate quantities and costs to meet anticipated demand, and the risk that new
products may have quality or other defects in the early stages of introduction. accordingly, the company cannot determine in advance the ultimate effect of new product introductions and transitions on its financial condition and operating results.the company faces substantial inventory and other asset risk in addition to purchase commitment cancellation risk.the company records a write-down for product and component inventories that have become obsolete or exceed anticipated
demand or net realizable value and accrues necessary cancellation fee reserves for orders of excess products and components. the company also reviews its long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changed circumstances indicate the carrying
amount of an asset may not be recoverable. if the company determines that impairment has occurred, it records a write-down equal to the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds its fair market value. although the company believes its
provisions related to inventory, other assets and purchase commitments are currently adequate, no assurance can be given that the company will not incur additional related charges given the rapid and unpredictable pace of product obsolescence in the
industries in which the company competes. such charges could materially adversely affect the companys financial condition and operating results.12



the company must order
components for its products and build inventory in advance of product announcements and shipments. consistent with industry practice, components are normally acquired through a combination of purchase orders, supplier contracts, open orders and,
where appropriate, prepayments, in each case based on projected demand. such purchase commitments typically cover forecasted component and manufacturing requirements for 30 to 150 days. because the companys markets are volatile, competitive
and subject to rapid technology and price changes, there is a risk the company will forecast incorrectly and order or produce excess or insufficient inventories of components or products. the companys financial condition and operating results
have been in the past and could be in the future materially adversely affected by the companys ability to manage its inventory levels and respond to short-term shifts in customer demand patterns.future operating results depend upon the companys ability to obtain key components including but not limited to microprocessors,
nand flash memory, dram and lcds at favorable prices and in sufficient quantities.because the company currently obtains
certain key components including but not limited to microprocessors, enclosures, certain lcds, certain optical drives, and asics, from single or limited sources, the company is subject to significant supply and pricing risks. many of these and other
key components that are available from multiple sources including but not limited to nand flash memory, dram and certain lcds, are subject at times to industry-wide shortages and significant commodity pricing fluctuations. the company has entered
into certain agreements for the supply of key components including but not limited to microprocessors, nand flash memory, dram and lcds at favorable pricing, but there is no guarantee that the company will be able to extend or renew these agreements
on similar favorable terms, or at all, upon expiration or otherwise obtain favorable pricing in the future. the follow-on effects from the credit crisis on the companys key suppliers, referred to in economic conditions could
materially adversely affect the company above, which is incorporated herein by reference, also could affect the companys ability to obtain key components. therefore, the company remains subject to significant risks of supply
shortages and/or price increases that could materially adversely affect the companys financial condition and operating results. the company expects to experience decreases in its gross margin percentage in future periods, as compared to levels
achieved during 2010, largely due to a higher mix of new and innovative products that have higher cost structures and deliver greater value to customers, and expected and potential future component cost and other cost increases. for additional
information refer to part ii, item 7, managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations, under the subheading gross margin, which is incorporated herein by reference.the company and other participants in the personal computer, and mobile communication and media device industries compete for various
components with other industries that have experienced increased demand for their products. the company uses some custom components that are not common to the rest of these industries. the companys new products often utilize custom components
available from only one source. when a component or product uses new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers yields have matured or manufacturing capacity has increased. continued availability of these
components at acceptable prices, or at all, may be affected if those suppliers decided to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the companys requirements. if the supply of a key
single-sourced component for a new or existing product were delayed or constrained, if such components were available only at significantly higher prices, or if a key manufacturing vendor delayed shipments of completed products to the company, the
companys financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected.the company depends on
component and product manufacturing and logistical services provided by third parties, many of whom are located outside of the u.s.substantially all of the companys components and products are manufactured in whole or in part by a few third-party manufacturers. many of these manufacturers are located outside of the u.s., and
are concentrated in several general locations. the company has also outsourced much of its transportation and logistics management. while these arrangements may lower operating costs, they also reduce the companys direct control over
production and distribution. it is uncertain what effect such diminished control will have on the quality or quantity of13



products or services, or the companys flexibility to respond to changing conditions. in addition, the company relies on third-party manufacturers to adhere to the companys supplier
code of conduct. although arrangements with such manufacturers may contain provisions for warranty expense reimbursement, the company may remain responsible to the consumer for warranty service in the event of product defects. any unanticipated
product defect or warranty liability, whether pursuant to arrangements with contract manufacturers or otherwise, could materially adversely affect the companys reputation, financial condition and operating results.final assembly of the companys products is currently performed in the companys manufacturing facility in ireland, and by
external vendors in california, texas, china, the czech republic and korea. currently, the supply and manufacture of many critical components is performed by sole-sourced third-party vendors in the u.s., china, germany, ireland, israel, japan,
korea, malaysia, the netherlands, the philippines, taiwan, thailand and singapore. sole-sourced third-party vendors in china perform final assembly of substantially all of the companys mac products, iphones, ipads and ipods. if manufacturing
or logistics in these locations is disrupted for any reason, including but not limited to, natural disasters, information technology system failures, military actions or economic, business, labor, environmental, public health, or political issues,
the companys financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected.the company relies on
third-party digital content, which may not be available to the company on commercially reasonable terms or at all.the
company contracts with certain third parties to offer their digital content through the companys itunes store. the companys licensing arrangements with these third parties are short-term and do not guarantee the continuation or renewal
of these arrangements on reasonable terms, if at all. some third-party content providers currently or in the future may offer competing products and services, and could take action to make it more difficult or impossible for the company to license
their content in the future. other content owners, providers or distributors may seek to limit the companys access to, or increase the total cost of, such content. if the company is unable to continue to offer a wide variety of content at
reasonable prices with acceptable usage rules, or continue to expand its geographic reach, the companys financial condition and operating results may be materially adversely affected.many third-party content providers require that the company provide certain digital rights management (drm) and other
security solutions. if these requirements change, the company may have to develop or license new technology to provide these solutions. there is no assurance the company will be able to develop or license such solutions at a reasonable cost and in a
timely manner. in addition, certain countries have passed or may propose legislation that would force the company to license its drm, which could lessen the protection of content and subject it to piracy and also could affect arrangements with the
companys content providers.the company relies on access to third-party patents and intellectual property, and the
companys future results could be materially adversely affected if it is alleged or found to have infringed intellectual property rights.many of the companys products are designed to include third-party intellectual property, and in the future the company may need to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of its products
and business methods. although the company believes that, based on past experience and industry practice, such licenses generally could be obtained on reasonable terms, there is no assurance that the necessary licenses would be available on
acceptable terms or at all.because of technological changes in the industries in which the company competes, current
extensive patent coverage, and the rapid issuance of new patents, it is possible that certain components of the companys products and business methods may unknowingly infringe the patents or other intellectual property rights of third parties.
from time to time, the company has been notified that it may be infringing such rights. regardless of merit, responding to such claims can consume significant time and expense. at present, the company is vigorously defending a number of patent
infringement cases, and several pending claims are in various stages of evaluation. in certain cases, the company may consider the desirability of entering into licensing agreements, although no14



assurance can be given that such licenses can be obtained on acceptable terms or that litigation will not occur. if the company is found to be infringing such rights, it may be required to pay
substantial damages. if there is a temporary or permanent injunction prohibiting the company from marketing or selling certain products or a successful claim of infringement against the company requires it to pay royalties to a third party, the
companys financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected, regardless of whether it can develop non-infringing technology. while in managements opinion the company does not have a potential liability for
damages or royalties from any known current legal proceedings or claims related to the infringement of patent or other intellectual property rights that would individually or in the aggregate materially adversely affect its financial condition and
operating results, the results of such legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty. should the company fail to prevail in any of the matters related to infringement of patent or other intellectual property rights of others or should several
of these matters be resolved against the company in the same reporting period, the companys financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected.with the introduction of iphones and 3g enabled ipads, the company has begun to compete with mobile communication and media devices
companies that hold significant patent portfolios. regardless of the scope or validity of such patents or the merits of any potential patent claims by competitors, the company may have to engage in protracted litigation, enter into
expensive agreements or settlements and/or modify its products. any of these events could have a material adverse impact on the companys financial condition and operating results.the companys future performance depends on support from third-party software developers. if third-party software applications
and services cease to be developed and maintained for the companys products, customers may choose not to buy the companys products.the company believes decisions by customers to purchase its hardware products, including its macs, iphones, ipads and ipods, are often based to a certain extent on the availability of third-party software
applications and services. there is no assurance that third-party developers will continue to develop and maintain applications and services for the companys products on a timely basis or at all, and discontinuance or delay of these
applications and services could materially adversely affect the companys financial condition and operating results.with respect to its mac products, the company believes the availability of third-party software applications and services depends in part
on the developers perception and analysis of the relative benefits of developing, maintaining, and upgrading such software for the companys products compared to windows-based products. this analysis may be based on factors such as the
perceived strength of the company and its products, the anticipated revenue that may be generated, continued acceptance by customers of mac os x, and the costs of developing such applications and services. if the companys minority share of the
global personal computer market causes developers to question the companys prospects, developers could be less inclined to develop or upgrade software for the companys products and more inclined to devote their resources to developing
and upgrading software for the larger windows market. the companys development of its own software applications and services may also negatively affect the decisions of third-party developers, such as microsoft, adobe and google, to develop,
maintain, and upgrade similar or competitive software and services for the companys products.with respect to iphone,
ipad and ipod touch, the company relies on the continued availability and development of compelling and innovative software applications. unlike third-party software applications for mac products, the software applications for the iphone, ipad and
ipod touch platforms are distributed through a single distribution channel, the app store. the absence of multiple distribution channels, which are available for competing platforms, may limit the availability and acceptance of third-party
applications by the companys customers, thereby causing developers to curtail significantly, or stop, development for the companys platforms. in addition, iphone, ipad and ipod touch are subject to rapid technological change, and, if
third-party developers are unable to keep up with this pace of change, third-party applications might not successfully operate and may result in dissatisfied customers. further, if the company develops its own software applications and services,
such development may negatively affect the decisions of third-party developers to develop, maintain,15



and upgrade similar or competitive applications for the iphone, ipad and ipod touch platforms. as with applications for the companys mac products, the availability and development of these
applications also depend on developers perceptions and analysis of the relative benefits of developing software for the companys products rather than its competitors products, including devices that use competing platforms. if
developers focus their efforts on these competing platforms, the availability and quality of applications for the companys devices may suffer.the companys future operating performance depends on the performance of distributors, carriers and other resellers.the company distributes its products through wholesalers, resellers, national and regional retailers, value-added resellers, and cataloguers, many of whom distribute products from competing manufacturers.
the company also sells many of its products and resells third-party products in most of its major markets directly to customers, certain education customers, cellular network carriers distribution channels and certain resellers through its
online and retail stores.many resellers operate on narrow operating margins and have been negatively affected in the past by
weak economic conditions. some resellers have perceived the expansion of the companys direct sales as conflicting with their business interests as distributors and resellers of the companys products. such a perception could discourage
resellers from investing resources in the distribution and sale of the companys products or lead them to limit or cease distribution of those products. the companys financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely
affected if the financial condition of these resellers weakens, if resellers stopped distributing the companys products, or if uncertainty regarding demand for the companys products caused resellers to reduce their ordering and marketing
of the companys products. the company has invested and will continue to invest in programs to enhance reseller sales, including staffing selected resellers stores with company employees and contractors and improving product placement
displays. these programs could require a substantial investment while providing no assurance of return or incremental revenue.the companys retail business has required and will continue to require a substantial investment and commitment of resources and
is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties.the companys retail stores have required substantial fixed
investment in equipment and leasehold improvements, information systems, inventory and personnel. the company also has entered into substantial operating lease commitments for retail space, with terms ranging from five to 20 years, the majority of
which are for ten years. certain stores have been designed and built to serve as high-profile venues to promote brand awareness and serve as vehicles for corporate sales and marketing activities. because of their unique design elements, locations
and size, these stores require substantially more investment than the companys more typical retail stores. due to the high fixed cost structure associated with the retail segment, a decline in sales or the closure or poor performance of
individual or multiple stores could result in significant lease termination costs, write-offs of equipment and leasehold improvements, and severance costs that could materially adversely affect the companys financial condition and operating
results.many factors unique to retail operations, some of which are beyond the companys control, pose risks and
uncertainties that could materially adversely affect the companys financial condition and operating results. these risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, macro-economic factors that could have a negative effect on general
retail activity, as well as the companys inability to manage costs associated with store construction and operation, inability to sell third-party products at adequate margins, failure to manage relationships with existing retail channel
partners, more challenging environment in managing retail operations outside the u.s., costs associated with unanticipated fluctuations in the value of retail inventory, and inability to obtain and renew leases in quality retail locations at a
reasonable cost.16



investment in new
business strategies and initiatives could disrupt the companys ongoing business and present risks not originally contemplated.the company has invested, and in the future may invest, in new business strategies or acquisitions. such endeavors may involve significant risks and uncertainties, including distraction of management from
current operations, insufficient revenue to offset liabilities assumed and expenses associated with the strategy, inadequate return of capital, and unidentified issues not discovered in the companys due diligence. because these new ventures
are inherently risky, no assurance can be given that such strategies and initiatives will be successful and will not materially adversely affect the companys financial condition and operating results.the companys products and services experience quality problems from time to time that can result in decreased sales and
operating margin.the company sells highly complex hardware and software products and services that can contain defects in
design and manufacture. sophisticated operating system software and applications, such as those sold by the company, often contain bugs that can unexpectedly interfere with the softwares intended operation. defects may also occur
in components and products the company purchases from third parties. there can be no assurance the company will be able to detect and fix all defects in the hardware, software and services it sells. failure to do so could result in lost revenue,
harm to reputation, and significant warranty and other expenses, and could have a material adverse impact on the companys financial condition and operating results.in the u.s. the company relies on a single cellular network carrier to provide service for iphone.in the u.s. the company has contracted with a single carrier to provide cellular network services for iphone on an exclusive basis. if this exclusive carrier cannot successfully compete with other
carriers in the u.s. market on any basis, including but not limited to the quality and coverage of wireless voice and data services, performance and timely build-out of advanced wireless networks, and pricing and other terms or conditions of
customer contracts, or if this exclusive carrier fails to promote iphone aggressively or favor other handsets in their promotion and sales activities or service plans, sales may be materially adversely affected.the company is subject to risks associated with laws, regulations and industry-imposed standards related to mobile communications and
media devices.laws and regulations related to mobile communications and media devices in the many jurisdictions in which
the company operates are extensive and subject to change. such changes, which could include but are not limited to restrictions on production, manufacture, distribution, and use of the device, locking the device to a carriers network, or
mandating the use of the device on more than one carriers network, could materially adversely affect the companys financial condition and operating results.mobile communication and media devices, such as iphones and 3g enabled ipads, are subject to certification and regulation by governmental and standardization bodies, as well as by cellular network
carriers for use on their networks. these certification processes are extensive and time consuming, and could result in additional testing requirements, product modifications or delays in product shipment dates, which could materially adversely
affect the companys financial condition and operating results.the companys success depends largely on the
continued service and availability of key personnel.much of the companys future success depends on the continued
availability and service of key personnel, including its ceo, its executive team and highly skilled employees in technical, marketing and staff positions. experienced personnel in the technology industry are in high demand and competition for their
talents is intense, especially in the silicon valley, where most of the companys key personnel are located. there can be no assurance that the company will continue to attract and retain key personnel.17



political events,
war, terrorism, public health issues, natural disasters and other circumstances could materially adversely affect the company.war, terrorism, geopolitical uncertainties, public health issues, and other business interruptions have caused and could cause damage or disruption to international commerce and the global economy, and
thus could have a strong negative effect on the company, its suppliers, logistics providers, manufacturing vendors and customers, including channel partners. the companys business operations are subject to interruption by natural disasters,
fire, power shortages, terrorist attacks, and other hostile acts, labor disputes, public health issues, and other events beyond its control. such events could decrease demand for the companys products, make it difficult or impossible for the
company to make and deliver products to its customers, including channel partners, or to receive components from its suppliers, and create delays and inefficiencies in the companys supply chain. should major public health issues, including
pandemics, arise, the company could be negatively affected by more stringent employee travel restrictions, additional limitations in freight services, governmental actions limiting the movement of products between regions, delays in production ramps
of new products, and disruptions in the operations of the companys manufacturing vendors and component suppliers. the majority of the companys research and development activities, its corporate headquarters, information technology
systems, and other critical business operations, including certain component suppliers and manufacturing vendors, are in locations that could be affected by natural disasters. in the event of a natural disaster, losses and significant recovery time
could be required to resume operations and the companys financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected.the company may be subject to information technology system failures, network disruptions and breaches in data security.information technology system failures, network disruptions and breaches of data security caused by such factors, including but not limited to, earthquakes, fire, theft, fraud, malicious attack or other
causes could disrupt the companys operations by causing delays or cancellation of customer, including channel partner, orders, negatively affecting the companys online, itunes, mobileme and retail offerings and services, impeding the
manufacture or shipment of products, processing transactions and reporting financial results, resulting in the unintentional disclosure of customer or company information, or damage to the companys reputation. while management has taken steps
to address these concerns by implementing sophisticated network security and internal control measures, there can be no assurance that a system failure or loss or data security breach will not materially adversely affect the companys financial
condition and operating results.the company expects its quarterly revenue and operating results to fluctuate for a
variety of reasons.the companys profit margins vary among its products and its distribution channels. the
companys software, accessories, and service and support contracts generally have higher gross margins than certain of the companys other products. gross margins on the companys hardware products vary across product lines and can
change over time as a result of product transitions, pricing and configuration changes, and component, warranty, and other cost fluctuations. the companys direct sales generally have higher associated gross margins than its indirect sales
through its channel partners. in addition, the companys gross margin and operating margin percentages, as well as overall profitability, may be materially adversely impacted as a result of a shift in product, geographic or channel mix, new
products, component cost increases, strengthening u.s. dollar, or price competition. the company has typically experienced greater net sales in the first and fourth fiscal quarters compared to the second and third fiscal quarters due to seasonal
demand related to the holiday season and the beginning of the school year, respectively. furthermore, the company sells more products from time-to-time during the third month of a quarter than it does during either of the first two months.
developments late in a quarter, such as lower-than-anticipated demand for the companys products, issues with new product introductions, an internal systems failure, or failure of one of the companys key logistics, components supply, or
manufacturing partners, could have a material adverse impact on the companys financial condition and operating results.18



the companys
stock price continues to be volatile.the companys stock has at times experienced substantial price volatility due
to a number of factors, including but not limited to variations between its actual and anticipated financial results, announcements by the company and its competitors, and uncertainty about current global economic conditions. the stock market as a
whole also has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market price of many technology companies in ways that may have been unrelated to these companies operating performance. furthermore, the company believes
its stock price reflects high future growth and profitability expectations. if the company fails to meet these expectations its stock price may significantly decline, which could have a material adverse impact on investor confidence and employee
retention.the companys business is subject to the risks of international operations.the company derives a significant portion of its revenue and earnings from its international operations. compliance with u.s. and foreign
laws and regulations that apply to the companys international operations, including without limitation import and export requirements, anti-corruption laws, tax laws (including u.s. taxes on foreign subsidiaries), foreign exchange controls and
cash repatriation restrictions, data privacy requirements, labor laws, and anti-competition regulations, increases the costs of doing business in foreign jurisdictions, and any such costs, which may rise in the future as a result of changes in these
laws and regulations or in their interpretation. furthermore, the company has implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these laws and regulations, but there can be no assurance that the companys employees,
contractors, or agents will not violate such laws and regulations or the companys policies. any such violations could individually or in the aggregate materially adversely affect the companys financial condition or operating results.the companys financial condition and operating results also could be significantly affected by other risks associated
with international activities, including but not limited to, economic and labor conditions, increased duties, taxes and other costs, political instability, and changes in the value of the u.s. dollar versus local currencies. margins on sales of the
companys products in foreign countries, and on sales of products that include components obtained from foreign suppliers, could be materially adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and by international trade
regulations, including duties, tariffs and antidumping penalties. additionally, the company is exposed to credit and collectability risk on its trade receivables with customers in certain international markets. there can be no assurance it can
effectively limit its credit risk and avoid losses, which could materially adversely affect the companys financial condition and operating results.the companys primary exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates relate to non-u.s. dollar denominated sales in europe, japan, australia, canada and certain parts of asia, as well as
non-u.s. dollar denominated operating expenses incurred throughout the world. weakening of foreign currencies relative to the u.s. dollar will adversely affect the u.s. dollar value of the companys foreign currency-denominated sales and
earnings, and generally will lead the company to raise international pricing, potentially reducing demand for the companys products. in some circumstances, due to competition or other reasons, the company may decide not to raise local prices
to the full extent of the dollars strengthening, or at all, which would adversely affect the u.s. dollar value of the companys foreign currency denominated sales and earnings. conversely, a strengthening of foreign currencies, while
generally beneficial to the companys foreign currency-denominated sales and earnings, could cause the company to reduce international pricing and incur losses on its foreign currency derivative instruments, thereby limiting the benefit.
additionally, strengthening of foreign currencies may also increase the companys cost of product components denominated in those currencies, thus adversely affecting gross margins.the company has used derivative instruments, such as foreign currency forward and option contracts, to hedge certain exposures to
fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. the use of such hedging activities may not offset any or more than a portion of the adverse financial effects of unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates over the limited time the hedges are in
place.19



the company is
exposed to credit risk and fluctuations in the market values of its investment portfolio.although the company has not
recognized any significant losses to date on its cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, any significant future declines in their market values could materially adversely affect the companys financial condition and operating results.
given the global nature of its business, the company has investments both domestically and internationally. credit ratings and pricing of these investments can be negatively impacted by liquidity, credit deterioration or losses, financial results,
or other factors. as a result, the value or liquidity of the companys cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities could decline and result in a material impairment, which could materially adversely affect the companys financial
condition and operating results.the company is exposed to credit risk on its trade accounts receivable, vendor non-trade
receivables and prepayments related to long-term supply agreements. this risk is heightened during periods when economic conditions worsen.the company distributes its products through third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers and value-added resellers. a substantial majority of the companys outstanding trade
receivables are not covered by collateral or credit insurance. the companys exposure to credit and collectability risk on its trade receivables are increased in certain international markets and its ability to mitigate such risks may be
limited. cellular network carriers accounted for a significant potion of the companys trade receivables as of september 25, 2010. the company also has unsecured vendor non-trade receivables resulting from purchases of components by
contract manufacturers and other vendors that manufacture sub-assemblies or assemble final products for the company. two vendors accounted for a significant portion of the companys non-trade receivables as of september 25, 2010. in
addition, the company has made prepayments associated with long-term supply agreements to secure supply of certain inventory components. while the company has procedures to monitor and limit exposure to credit risk on its trade and vendor non-trade
receivables as well as long-term prepayments, there can be no assurance such procedures will effectively limit its credit risk and avoid losses, which could materially adversely affect the companys financial condition and operating results.the matters relating to the companys past stock option practices and its restatement of consolidated financial
statements may result in additional litigation.the companys investigation into its past stock option practices and
its restatement of prior financial statements in the annual report on form 10-k for the year ended september 30, 2006 gave rise to litigation and government investigations. as described in part i, item 3, legal proceedings,
several derivative and class action complaints regarding stock options were filed against the company and current and former officers and directors. these actions have been dismissed following a comprehensive settlement. two former officers of the
company were also named as defendants in an sec enforcement action, which has been settled.no assurance can be given that
additional actions will not be filed against the company and current and former officers and directors as a result of past stock option practices. if such actions are filed and result in adverse findings, the remedies could materially adversely
affect the companys financial condition and operating results.unfavorable results of legal proceedings could
materially adversely affect the company.the company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that have arisen
out of the ordinary conduct of its business and are not yet resolved and additional claims may arise in the future. results of legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty. regardless of merit, litigation may be both time-consuming and
disruptive to the companys operations and cause significant expense and diversion of management attention. in recognition of these considerations, the company may enter into material settlements. should the company fail to prevail in certain
matters, or should several of these matters be resolved against the company in the same reporting period, the company may be faced with significant monetary damages or injunctive relief against it that would materially adversely affect a portion of
its business and might materially affect the companys financial condition and operating results.20

the mac; iphone, ipad and ipod and related software; development of new digital lifestyle consumer and professional software applications; and investing in new product areas and technologies. the
company also believes increased investment in marketing and advertising programs is critical to increasing product and brand awareness.the company utilizes a variety of direct and indirect distribution channels, including its retail stores, online stores, and direct sales force, and third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers,
retailers, and value-added resellers. the company believes that sales of its innovative and differentiated products are enhanced by knowledgeable salespersons who can convey the value of the hardware, software, and peripheral integration,
demonstrate the unique digital lifestyle solutions that are available on its products, and demonstrate the compatibility of the mac with the windows platform and networks. the company further believes providing direct contact with its targeted
customers is an effective way to demonstrate the advantages of its products over those of its competitors and providing a high-quality sales and after-sales support experience is critical to attracting new and retaining existing customers. to ensure
a high-quality buying experience for its products in which service and education are emphasized, the company continues to expand and improve its distribution capabilities by expanding the number of its own retail stores worldwide. additionally, the
company has invested in programs to enhance reseller sales by placing high quality apple fixtures, merchandising materials and other resources within selected third-party reseller locations. through the apple premium reseller program, certain
third-party resellers focus on the apple platform by providing a high level of integration and support services, and product expertise.critical accounting policies and estimatesthe preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles (gaap) and the companys discussion and analysis of its
financial condition and operating results require the companys management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported in its consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. note 1, summary of
significant accounting policies of notes to consolidated financial statements in this form 10-k describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the companys consolidated financial statements.
management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and
liabilities. actual results may differ from these estimates and such differences may be material.management believes the
companys critical accounting policies and estimates are those related to revenue recognition, valuation and impairment of marketable securities, inventory valuation and inventory purchase commitments, warranty costs, income taxes, and legal
and other contingencies. management considers these policies critical because they are both important to the portrayal of the companys financial condition and operating results, and they require management to make judgments and estimates about
inherently uncertain matters. the companys senior management has reviewed these critical accounting policies and related disclosures with the audit and finance committee of the companys board of directors.revenue recognitionnet
sales consist primarily of revenue from the sale of hardware, software, digital content and applications, peripherals, and service and support contracts. the company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has
occurred, the sales price is fixed or determinable, and collection is probable. product is considered delivered to the customer once it has been shipped and title and risk of loss have been transferred. for most of the companys product sales,
these criteria are met at the time the product is shipped. for online sales to individuals, for some sales to education customers in the u.s., and for certain other sales, the company defers recognition of revenue until the customer receives the
product because the company retains a portion of the risk of loss on these sales during transit. the company recognizes revenue from the sale of hardware products (e.g., macs, iphones, ipads, ipods and peripherals), software bundled with hardware
that is28



essential to the functionality of the hardware, and third-party digital content sold on the itunes store in accordance with general revenue recognition accounting guidance. the company recognizes
revenue in accordance with industry specific software accounting guidance for the following types of sales transactions: (i) standalone sales of software products, (ii) sales of software upgrades and (iii) sales of software bundled
with hardware not essential to the functionality of the hardware.for multi-element arrangements that include tangible
products containing software essential to the tangible products functionality and undelivered software elements relating to the tangible products essential software, the company allocates revenue to all deliverables based on their
relative selling prices. in such circumstances, the company uses a hierarchy to determine the selling price to be used for allocating revenue to deliverables: (i) vendor-specific objective evidence of fair value (vsoe),
(ii) third-party evidence of selling price (tpe) and (iii) best estimate of the selling price (esp). vsoe generally exists only when the company sells the deliverable separately and is the price actually charged by
the company for that deliverable. esps reflect the companys best estimates of what the selling prices of elements would be if they were sold regularly on a stand-alone basis.for all past and current sales of iphone, ipad, apple tv and for sales of ipod touch beginning in june 2010, the company indicated it
might from time-to-time provide future unspecified software upgrades and features free of charge to customers. the company has identified two deliverables in arrangements involving the sale of these devices. the first deliverable is the hardware and
software essential to the functionality of the hardware device delivered at the time of sale. the second deliverable is the embedded right included with the purchase of iphone, ipad, ipod touch and apple tv to receive on a when-and-if-available
basis, future unspecified software upgrades and features relating to the products essential software. the company has allocated revenue between these two deliverables using the relative selling price method. because the company has neither
vsoe nor tpe for the two deliverables, the allocation of revenue has been based on the companys esps. amounts allocated to the delivered hardware and the related essential software are recognized at the time of sale provided the other
conditions for revenue recognition have been met. amounts allocated to the embedded unspecified software upgrade right are deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis over the 24-month estimated life of each of these devices. all product cost
of sales, including estimated warranty costs, are recognized at the time of sale. costs for engineering and sales and marketing are expensed as incurred. if the estimated life of the hardware product should change, the future rate of amortization of
the revenue allocated to the software upgrade right will also change.the companys process for determining its esp for
deliverables without vsoe or tpe involves managements judgment. the companys process considers multiple factors that may vary depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each deliverable. the company believes its
customers, particularly consumers, would be reluctant to buy unspecified software upgrade rights related to iphone, ipad, ipod touch and apple tv. this view is primarily based on the fact that unspecified upgrade rights do not obligate the company
to provide upgrades at a particular time or at all, and do not specify to customers which upgrades or features will be delivered. therefore, the company has concluded if it were to sell upgrade rights on a standalone basis, including those rights
associated with iphone, ipad, ipod touch and apple tv, the selling price would be relatively low. key factors considered by the company in developing the esps for these upgrade rights include prices charged by the company for similar offerings, the
companys historical pricing practices, the nature of the upgrade rights (e.g., unspecified and when-and-if-available), and the relative esp of the upgrade rights as compared to the total selling price of the product. the company may also
consider, when appropriate, the impact of other products and services, including advertising services, on selling price assumptions when developing and reviewing its esps for software upgrade rights and related deliverables. the company may also
consider additional factors as appropriate, including the pricing of competitive alternatives if they exist, and product-specific business objectives. if the facts and circumstances underlying the factors considered change or should future facts and
circumstances lead the company to consider additional factors, the companys esp for software upgrades related to future sales for these devices could change.29



beginning in the third
quarter of 2010 in conjunction with the announcement of ios 4, the companys esps for the embedded software upgrade rights included with iphone, ipad and ipod touch reflect the positive financial impact expected by the company as a result of
its introduction of a mobile advertising platform for these devices and the expectation of customers regarding software that includes or supports an advertising component. ios 4 supports iad, the companys new mobile advertising platform, which
enables applications on iphone, ipad and ipod touch to feature media-rich advertisements within applications.the company
records reductions to revenue for estimated commitments related to price protection and for customer incentive programs, including reseller and end-user rebates, and other sales programs and volume-based incentives. for transactions involving price
protection, the company recognizes revenue net of the estimated amount to be refunded, provided the refund amount can be reasonably and reliably estimated and the other conditions for revenue recognition have been met. the companys policy
requires that, if refunds cannot be reliably estimated, revenue is not recognized until reliable estimates can be made or the price protection lapses. for customer incentive programs, the estimated cost of these programs is recognized at the later
of the date at which the company has sold the product or the date at which the program is offered. the company also records reductions to revenue for expected future product returns based on the companys historical experience. future market
conditions and product transitions may require the company to increase customer incentive programs and incur incremental price protection obligations that could result in additional reductions to revenue at the time such programs are offered.
additionally, certain customer incentive programs require management to estimate the number of customers who will actually redeem the incentive. managements estimates are based on historical experience and the specific terms and conditions of
particular incentive programs. if a greater than estimated proportion of customers redeem such incentives, the company would be required to record additional reductions to revenue, which would have a negative impact on the companys results of
operations.valuation and impairment of marketable securitiesthe companys investments in available-for-sale securities are reported at fair value. unrealized gains and losses related to changes in the fair value of investments are included in accumulated
other comprehensive income, net of tax, as reported in the companys condensed consolidated balance sheets. changes in the fair value of investments impact the companys net income only when such investments are sold or an
other-than-temporary impairment is recognized. realized gains and losses on the sale of securities are determined by specific identification of each securitys cost basis. the company regularly reviews its investment portfolio to determine if
any investment is other-than-temporarily impaired due to changes in credit risk or other potential valuation concerns, which would require the company to record an impairment charge in the period any such determination is made. in making this
judgment, the company evaluates, among other things, the duration and extent to which the fair value of an investment is less than its cost, the financial condition of the issuer and any changes thereto, and the companys intent to sell, or
whether it is more likely than not it will be required to sell, the investment before recovery of the investments amortized cost basis. the companys assessment on whether an investment is other-than-temporarily impaired or not, could
change in the future due to new developments or changes in assumptions related to any particular investment.inventory valuation and
inventory purchase commitmentsthe company must order components for its products and build inventory in advance of
product shipments. the company records a write-down for inventories of components and products, including third-party products held for resale, which have become obsolete or are in excess of anticipated demand or net realizable value. the company
performs a detailed review of inventory each fiscal quarter that considers multiple factors including demand forecasts, product life cycle status, product development plans, current sales levels, and component cost trends. the industries in which
the company competes are subject to a rapid and unpredictable pace of product and component obsolescence and demand changes. if future demand or market conditions for the companys products are less favorable than forecasted or if unforeseen
technological changes negatively impact the utility of component inventory, the company may be required to record additional write-downs, which would negatively affect its results of operations in the period when the write-downs were recorded.30



the company records
accruals for estimated cancellation fees related to component orders that have been cancelled or are expected to be cancelled. consistent with industry practice, the company acquires components through a combination of purchase orders, supplier
contracts, and open orders based on projected demand information. these commitments typically cover the companys requirements for periods ranging from 30 to 150 days. if there is an abrupt and substantial decline in demand for one or more of
the companys products or an unanticipated change in technological requirements for any of the companys products, the company may be required to record additional accruals for cancellation fees that would negatively affect its results of
operations in the period when the cancellation fees are identified and recorded.warranty coststhe company provides for the estimated cost of hardware and software warranties at the time the related revenue is recognized based on
historical and projected warranty claim rates, historical and projected cost-per-claim, and knowledge of specific product failures that are outside of the companys typical experience. each quarter, the company reevaluates its estimates to
assess the adequacy of its recorded warranty liabilities considering the size of the installed base of products subject to warranty protection and adjusts the amounts as necessary. if actual product failure rates or repair costs differ from
estimates, revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required and could materially affect the companys results of operations.the company periodically provides updates to its applications and operating system software to maintain the softwares compliance with specifications. the estimated cost to develop such updates is
accounted for as warranty cost that is recognized at the time related software revenue is recognized. factors considered in determining appropriate accruals related to such updates include the number of units delivered, the number of updates
expected to occur, and the historical cost and estimated future cost of the resources necessary to develop these updates.income taxesthe company records a tax provision for the anticipated tax consequences of the reported results of operations. in
accordance with gaap, the provision for income taxes is computed using the asset and liability method, under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the
financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in effect for the
years in which those tax assets are expected to be realized or settled. the company records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is believed more likely than not to be realized.the company only recognizes the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be
sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50%
likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement.management believes it is more likely than not that forecasted income,
including income that may be generated as a result of certain tax planning strategies, together with future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, will be sufficient to fully recover the deferred tax assets. in the event that the
company determines all or part of the net deferred tax assets are not realizable in the future, the company will make an adjustment to the valuation allowance that would be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made. in addition,
the calculation of tax liabilities involves significant judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of gaap and complex tax laws. resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with managements
expectations could have a material impact on the companys financial condition and operating results.31



legal and other contingenciesas discussed in part i, item 3 of this form 10-k under the heading legal proceedings and in note 8
commitments and contingencies in notes to consolidated financial statements, the company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business. in accordance with gaap, the company records a
liability when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable. there is significant judgment required in both the probability determination and as to whether an exposure can be reasonably estimated. in
managements opinion, the company does not have a potential liability related to any current legal proceedings and claims that would individually or in the aggregate materially adversely affect its financial condition or operating results.
however, the outcomes of legal proceedings and claims brought against the company are subject to significant uncertainty. should the company fail to prevail in any of these legal matters or should several of these legal matters be resolved against
the company in the same reporting period, the operating results of a particular reporting period could be materially adversely affected.32

net sales of iphone and related products and services accounted for 39% of the companys total net sales for the year. iphone unit sales totaled 40 million in 2010, which represents an increase of 19.3 million or 93% compared to 2009.
iphone year-over-year growth was attributable primarily to continued growth from existing carriers, expanded distribution with new international carriers and resellers, and strong demand for iphone 4, which was released in the u.s. in june 2010 and
in many other countries over the remainder of 2010. as of september 25, 2010, the company distributed iphone in 89 countries through 166 carriers.net sales of ipad and related products and services were $5.0 billion and unit sales of ipad were 7.5 million during 2010. ipad was released in
the u.s. in april 2010 and in various other countries over the remainder of 2010. as of september 25, 2010, the company distributed ipad in 26 countries. the company distributes ipad through its direct channels, certain cellular network
carriers distribution channels and certain third-party resellers. net sales of ipad and related products and services accounted for 8% of the companys total net sales for 2010, reflecting the strong demand for ipad during the five months
following its release.mac net sales increased by $3.6 billion or 26% in 2010 compared to 2009, and mac unit sales increased by 3.3 million or 31% in 2010 compared to
2009. net sales per mac unit sold decreased by 4% in 2010 compared to 2009 due primarily to lower average selling prices of mac portable systems. net sales of the companys macs accounted for 27% of the companys total net sales in 2010
compared to 32% in 2009. during 2010, net sales and unit sales of the companys mac portable systems increased by 18% and 25%, respectively, primarily attributable to strong demand for macbook pro, which was updated in april 2010. net sales and
unit sales of the companys mac desktop systems increased by 43% and 45%, respectively, as a result of higher sales of imac, which was updated in july 2010.net sales of other music related products and services increased $912 million or 23% during 2010 compared to 2009. this increase was due primarily
to growth of the itunes store which generated total net sales of $4.1 billion for 2010. the results of the itunes store reflect growth of the itunes app store, continued growth in the installed base of iphone, ipad, and ipod customers, and the
expansion of third-party audio and video content available for sale and rent via the itunes store. the company continues to expand its itunes content and applications offerings around the world. net sales of other music related products and services
accounted for 8% of the companys total net sales for 2010.net sales of ipods increased $183 million or 2% during 2010, while ipod unit sales declined by 7% during 2010 compared to 2009. net sales per ipod
unit sold increased by 10% to $164 in 2010 compared to 2009, due to a shift in product mix toward ipod touch. ipod touch had strong growth in each of the companys reportable operating segments. net sales of ipods accounted for 13% of the
companys total net sales for the year compared to 19% in 2009.34



fiscal year 2009 versus 2008net sales during 2009 increased $5.4 billion or 14% compared to 2008. several factors contributed positively to these
increases, including the following:iphone revenue and net sales of related products and services amounted to $13.0 billion in 2009, an increase of $6.3 billion or 93% compared to
2008. the year-over-year iphone revenue growth is largely attributable to the year-over-year increase in iphone handset unit sales. iphone handset unit sales totaled 20.7 million during 2009, which represents an increase of 9.1 million or
78% during 2009 compared to 2008. this growth is attributed primarily to expanded distribution and strong overall demand for iphones. iphone 3gs was released in the u.s. on june 19, 2009 and in many other countries over the remainder of 2009.net sales of other music-related products and services increased $696 million or 21% during 2009 compared to 2008. the increase was due
predominantly to increased net sales of third-party digital content and applications from the itunes store, which experienced double-digit growth in each of the companys geographic segments during 2009 compared to the same period in 2008. the
company believes this is attributable primarily to continued interest in and growth of the itunes app store, continued growth in the companys base of iphone, ipad, and ipod customers, and the expansion of third-party audio and video content
available for sale and rent via the itunes storepartially offsetting the favorable factors discussed
above, net sales during 2009 were negatively impacted by certain factors, including the following:net sales of ipods decreased $1.1 billion or 12% during 2009 compared to 2008. ipod unit sales decreased by 1% during 2009 compared to 2008. net
sales per ipod unit sold decreased 11% to $149 in 2009 compared to 2008, resulting from lower average selling prices across all of the ipod product lines, due primarily to price reductions taken with the introduction of new ipods in september 2009
and september 2008 and a stronger u.s. dollar, offset partially by a higher mix of ipod touch sales.mac net sales declined 3% during 2009 compared to 2008, while mac unit sales increased by 7% over the same period. net sales per mac unit sold
decreased by 10% during 2009 compared to 2008, due primarily to lower average selling prices across all mac portable and desktop systems and a stronger u.s. dollar. net sales of macs accounted for 32% of the companys total net sales for 2009.
during 2009, mac portable systems net sales and unit sales increased by 9% and 20%, respectively, compared to 2008. this growth was driven by strong demand for macbook pro, which was updated in june 2009 and october 2008, and which experienced
double-digit net sales and unit growth in each of the companys reportable operating segments compared to the same period in 2008. the company also had a higher mix of mac portable systems sales, which is consistent with overall personal
computer market trends. net sales and unit sales of the companys mac desktop systems decreased by 23% and 14%, respectively, during 2009 compared to 2008. the decrease in net sales of mac desktop systems was due mainly to a shift in product
mix towards lower-priced desktops, lower average selling prices across all mac desktop systems and a stronger u.s. dollar.segment operating performancethe company manages its business primarily on a geographic basis. the companys reportable operating and reporting segments consist of the americas, europe, japan, asia-pacific and retail operations.
the americas, europe, japan and asia-pacific reportable segment results do not include the results of the retail segment. the americas segment includes both north and south america. the europe segment includes european countries as well as the
middle east and africa. the asia-pacific segment includes australia and asia, but does not include japan. the retail segment operates apple retail stores in 11 countries, including the u.s. each reportable operating segment provides similar hardware
and software products and similar services. further information regarding the companys operating segments may be found in note 9, segment information and geographic data in notes to consolidated financial statements of this form
10-k.35



americasduring 2010, net sales in the americas segment increased $5.5 billion or 29% compared to 2009. this increase in net sales was driven by
increased iphone revenue, strong demand for ipad, continued demand for mac desktop and portable systems, and higher sales of third-party digital content and applications from the itunes store. americas mac net sales and unit sales increased 18% and
21%, respectively, during 2010 compared to 2009, largely due to strong demand for macbook pro. the americas segment represented 37% and 44% of the companys total net sales in 2010 and 2009, respectively.during 2009, net sales in the americas segment increased $2.4 billion or 15% compared to 2008. the increase in net sales during 2009 was
attributable to the significant year-over-year increase in iphone revenue, higher sales of third-party digital content and applications from the itunes store, and increased sales of mac portable systems, partially offset by a decrease in sales of

the macbook pro. the americas segment represented approximately 44% of the companys total net sales in both 2009 and 2008.europeduring 2010, net sales in europe increased $6.9 billion or 58% compared to 2009. the growth in net sales was due mainly to
a significant increase in iphone revenue attributable to continued growth from existing carriers and country and carrier expansion, increased sales of mac desktop and portable systems and strong demand for ipad, partially offset by a stronger u.s.
dollar. europe mac net sales and unit sales increased 32% and 36%, respectively, during the year due to strong demand for macbook pro and imac. the europe segment represented 29% and 28% of the companys total net sales in 2010 and 2009,
respectively.during 2009, net sales in europe increased $2.6 billion or 28% compared to 2008. the increase in net sales was
due mainly to increased iphone revenue and strong sales of mac portable systems, offset partially by lower net sales of mac desktop systems, ipods, and a stronger u.s. dollar. mac unit sales increased 13% in 2009 compared to 2008, which was driven
primarily by increased sales of mac portable systems, particularly macbook pro, while total mac net sales declined as a result of lower average selling prices across all mac products. ipod net sales decreased year-over-year as a result of lower
average selling prices, partially offset by increased unit sales of the higher priced ipod touch. the europe segment represented 28% and 25% of total net sales in 2009 and 2008, respectively.japanduring 2010, japans net sales increased $1.7 billion or 75%
compared to 2009. the primary contributors to this growth were significant year-over-year increases in iphone revenue, strong demand for ipad, and to a lesser extent strength in the japanese yen. mac net sales increased by 8% driven by a 22%
increase in unit sales due primarily to strong demand for macbook pro and imac, partially offset by lower average selling prices in japan on a year-over-year basis. the japan segment represented 6% and 5% of the companys total net sales for
2010 and 2009, respectively.japans net sales increased $551 million or 32% in 2009 compared to 2008. the primary
contributors to this growth were increased iphone revenue, stronger demand for certain mac portable systems and ipods, and strength in the japanese yen, partially offset by decreased sales of mac desktop systems. net sales and unit sales of mac
portable systems increased during 2009 compared to 2008, driven primarily by stronger demand for macbook pro. net sales and unit sales of ipods increased during 2009 compared to 2008, driven by strong demand for ipod touch and ipod nano. the japan

asia-pacificnet sales in asia-pacific increased $5.1 billion or 160% during 2010 compared to 2009. the significant growth in asia-pacific net sales
was due mainly to increased iphone revenue, which was primarily attributable to country and carrier expansion and continued growth from existing carriers. asia-pacific net sales were also favorably affected by strong demand for mac portable and
desktop systems and for ipad. particularly strong year-over-year growth was experienced in china, korea and australia. the asia-pacific segment represented 13% and 7% of the companys total net sales for 2010 and 2009, respectively.net sales in asia-pacific increased $493 million or 18% during 2009 compared to 2008 reflecting strong growth in sales of iphone and mac
portable systems, offset partially by a decline in sales of ipods and mac desktop systems, as well as a strengthening of the u.s. dollar against the australian dollar and other asian currencies. mac net sales and unit sales grew in the asia-pacific
region by 4% and 17%, respectively, due to increased sales of the macbook pro. the asia-pacific segment represented approximately 7% of the companys total net sales in both 2009 and 2008.retailretail net sales
increased $3.1 billion or 47% during 2010 compared to 2009. the increase in net sales was driven primarily by strong demand for ipad, increased sales of mac desktop and portable systems and a significant year-over-year increase in iphone revenue.
mac net sales and unit sales grew in the retail segment by 25% and 35%, respectively, during 2010. the company opened 44 new retail stores during the year, 28 of which were international stores, ending the year with 317 stores open compared to 273
stores at the end of 2009. with an average of 288 stores and 254 stores opened during 2010 and 2009, respectively, average revenue per store increased to $34.1 million in 2010, compared to $26.2 million in 2009. the retail segment represented 15%
and 16% of the companys total net sales in 2010 and 2009, respectively.retail net sales decreased $636 million or 9%
during 2009 compared to 2008. the decline in net sales was driven largely by a decrease in net sales of iphones, ipods and mac desktop systems, offset partially by strong demand for mac portable systems. the year-over-year decline in retail net
sales was attributable to continued third-party channel expansion, particularly in the u.s. where most of the companys stores are located, and also reflects the challenging consumer-spending environment in 2009. the company opened 26 new
retail stores during 2009, including 14 international stores, ending the year with 273 stores open. this compares to 247 stores open as of september 27, 2008. with an average of 254 stores and 211 stores opened during 2009 and 2008,
respectively, average revenue per store decreased to $26.2 million for 2009 from $34.6 million in 2008.the retail segment
reported operating income of $2.4 billion during 2010 and $1.7 billion during both 2009 and 2008. the increase in retail operating income during 2010 compared to 2009 was attributable to higher overall net sales. despite the decline in retail net
sales during 2009 compared to 2008, the retail segments operating income was flat at $1.7 billion in 2009 compared to 2008 due primarily to a higher gross margin percentage in 2009 consistent with that experienced by the overall company.expansion of the retail segment has required and will continue to require a substantial investment in fixed assets and
related infrastructure, operating lease commitments, personnel, and other operating expenses. capital asset purchases associated with the retail segment since its inception totaled $2.2 billion through the end of 2010. as of september 25, 2010,
the retail segment had approximately 26,500 full-time equivalent employees and had outstanding lease commitments associated with retail space and related facilities of $1.7 billion. the company would incur substantial costs if it were to close
multiple retail stores and such costs could adversely affect the companys financial condition and operating results.37

percentage in 2010 was 39.4% compared to 40.1% in 2009. this decline in gross margin is primarily attributable to new products that have higher cost structures, including ipad, partially offset by a more favorable sales mix of iphone, which has a
higher gross margin than the company average.the gross margin percentage in 2009 was 40.1% compared to 35.2% in 2008. the
primary contributors to the increase in 2009 as compared to 2008 were a favorable sales mix toward products with higher gross margins and lower commodity and other product costs, which were partially offset by product price reductions.the company expects its gross margin percentage to decrease in future periods compared to levels achieved during 2010 and anticipates
gross margin levels of about 36% in the first quarter of 2011. this expected decline is largely due to a higher mix of new and innovative products that have higher cost structures and deliver greater value to customers, and expected and potential
future component cost and other cost increases.the foregoing statements regarding the companys expected gross margin
percentage are forward-looking and could differ from anticipated levels because of several factors, including but not limited to certain of those set forth below in part i, item 1a, risk factors under the subheading future
operating results depend upon the companys ability to obtain key components including but not limited to microprocessors, nand flash memory, dram and lcds at favorable prices and in sufficient quantities, which is incorporated herein
by reference. there can be no assurance that targeted gross margin percentage levels will be achieved. in general, gross margins and margins on individual products will remain under downward pressure due to a variety of factors, including continued
industry wide global product pricing pressures, increased competition, compressed product life cycles, product transitions and expected and potential increases in the cost of key components including but not limited to microprocessors, nand flash
memory, dram and lcds, as well as potential increases in the costs of outside manufacturing services and a potential shift in the companys sales mix towards products with lower gross margins. in response to these competitive pressures, the
company expects it will continue to take product pricing actions, which would adversely affect gross margins. gross margins could also be affected by the companys ability to manage product quality and warranty costs effectively and to
stimulate demand for certain of its products. due to the companys significant international operations, financial results can be significantly affected in the short-term by fluctuations in exchange rates.operating expensesoperating expenses for the three years ended september 25, 2010, are as follows (in millions, except for percentages):research and developmentpercentage of net salesselling, general and administrativepercentage of net sales38

research and development expense
(r&d)r&d expense increased 34% or $449 million to $1.8 billion in 2010 compared to 2009. this
increase was due primarily to an increase in headcount and related expenses in the current year to support expanded r&d activities. also contributing to this increase in r&d expense in 2010 was the capitalization in 2009 of software
development costs of $71 million related to mac os x snow leopard. although total r&d expense increased 34% during 2010, it declined as a percentage of net sales given the 52% year-over-year increase in net sales in 2010. the company continues
to believe that focused investments in r&d are critical to its future growth and competitive position in the marketplace and are directly related to timely development of new and enhanced products that are central to the companys core
business strategy. as such, the company expects to make further investments in r&d to remain competitive.r&d expense
increased 20% or $224 million to $1.3 billion in 2009 compared to 2008. this increase was due primarily to an increase in headcount in 2009 to support expanded r&d activities and higher stock-based compensation expenses. additionally, $71
million of software development costs were capitalized related to mac os x snow leopard and excluded from r&d expense during 2009, compared to $11 million of software development costs capitalized during 2008. although total r&d expense
increased 20% during 2009, it remained relatively flat as a percentage of net sales given the 14% increase in revenue in 2009.selling,
general and administrative expense (sg&a)sg&a expense increased $1.4 billion or 33% to $5.5 billion
in 2010 compared to 2009. this increase was due primarily to the companys continued expansion of its retail segment, higher spending on marketing and advertising programs, increased stock-based compensation expenses and variable costs
associated with the overall growth of the companys net sales.sg&a expenses increased $388 million or 10% to $4.1
billion in 2009 compared to 2008. this increase was due primarily to the companys continued expansion of its retail segment in both domestic and international markets, higher stock-based compensation expense and higher spending on marketing
and advertising.other income and expenseother income and expense for the three years ended september 25, 2010, are as follows (in millions):interest incomeother income (expense), nettotal other income and expensetotal other income and expense decreased $171 million or 52% to $155 million during 2010 compared to $326
million and $620 million in 2009 and 2008, respectively. the overall decrease in other income and expense is attributable to the significant declines in interest rates on a year-over-year basis, partially offset by the companys higher cash,
cash equivalents and marketable securities balances. the weighted average interest rate earned by the company on its cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities was 0.75%, 1.43% and 3.44% during 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. additionally
the company incurred higher premium expenses on its foreign exchange option contracts, which further reduced the total other income and expense. during 2010, 2009 and 2008, the company had no debt outstanding and accordingly did not incur any
related interest expense.provision for income taxesthe companys effective tax rates were 24%, 32% and 32% for 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. the companys effective rates for these periods differ from the statutory federal income tax rate
of 35% due39

primarily to certain undistributed foreign earnings for which no u.s. taxes are provided because such earnings are intended to be indefinitely reinvested outside the u.s. the lower effective tax
rate in 2010 as compared to 2009 is due primarily to an increase in foreign earnings on which u.s. income taxes have not been provided as such earnings are intended to be indefinitely reinvested outside the u.s.as of september 25, 2010, the company had deferred tax assets arising from deductible temporary differences, tax losses, and tax
credits of $2.4 billion, and deferred tax liabilities of $5.0 billion. management believes it is more likely than not that forecasted income, including income that may be generated as a result of certain tax planning strategies, together with future
reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, will be sufficient to fully recover the deferred tax assets. the company will continue to evaluate the realizability of deferred tax assets quarterly by assessing the need for and amount of a
valuation allowance.the internal revenue service (the irs) has completed its field audit of the companys
federal income tax returns for the years 2004 through 2006 and proposed certain adjustments. the company has contested certain of these adjustments through the irs appeals office. the irs is currently examining the years 2007 through 2009. all irs
audit issues for years prior to 2004 have been resolved. during the third quarter of 2010, the company reached a tax settlement with the irs for the years 2002 through 2003. in addition, the company is subject to audits by state, local, and foreign
tax authorities. management believes that adequate provision has been made for any adjustments that may result from tax examinations. however, the outcome of tax audits cannot be predicted with certainty. if any issues addressed in the
companys tax audits are resolved in a manner not consistent with managements expectations, the company could be required to adjust its provision for income taxes in the period such resolution occurs.liquidity and capital resourcesthe following table presents selected financial information and statistics as of and for the three years ended september 25, 2010 (in millions):cash, cash equivalents and marketable securitiesaccounts receivable, netinventoriesworking capitalannual operating cash flowas of
september 25, 2010, the company had $51 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, an increase of $17 billion from september 26, 2009. the principal component of this net increase was the cash generated by operating
activities of $18.6 billion, which was partially offset by payments for acquisition of property, plant and equipment of $2 billion and payments made in connection with business acquisitions, net of cash acquired, of $638 million.the companys marketable securities investment portfolio is invested primarily in highly rated securities, generally with a minimum
rating of single-a or equivalent. as of september 25, 2010 and september 26, 2009, $30.8 billion and $17.4 billion, respectively, of the companys cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities were held by foreign subsidiaries and
are generally based in u.s. dollar-denominated holdings. the company believes its existing balances of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities will be sufficient to satisfy its working capital needs, capital asset purchases, outstanding
commitments and other liquidity requirements associated with its existing operations over the next 12 months.40

capital assetsthe companys capital expenditures were $2.6 billion during 2010, consisting of approximately $404 million for retail store
facilities and $2.2 billion for other capital expenditures, including product tooling and manufacturing process equipment and corporate facilities and infrastructure. the companys actual cash payments for capital expenditures during 2010 were
$2 billion.the company anticipates utilizing approximately $4.0 billion for capital expenditures during 2011, including
approximately $600 million for retail store facilities and approximately $3.4 billion for product tooling and manufacturing process equipment, and corporate facilities and infrastructure, including information systems hardware, software and
enhancements.historically the company has opened between 25 and 50 new retail stores per year. during 2011, the company
expects to open 40 to 50 new stores, over half of which are expected to be located outside of the u.s.off-balance sheet arrangements and
contractual obligationsthe company has not entered into any transactions with unconsolidated entities whereby the company
has financial guarantees, subordinated retained interests, derivative instruments, or other contingent arrangements that expose the company to material continuing risks, contingent liabilities, or any other obligation under a variable interest in an
unconsolidated entity that provides financing, liquidity, market risk, or credit risk support to the company.the following
table presents certain payments due by the company under contractual obligations with minimum firm commitments as of september 25, 2010 and excludes amounts already recorded on the consolidated balance sheet (in millions):operating leasespurchase obligationsother obligationstotallease commitmentsas of september 25, 2010, the company had total outstanding commitments on noncancelable operating leases of $2.1 billion, $1.7 billion of which related to the lease of retail space and related
facilities. the companys major facility leases are typically for terms not exceeding 10 years and generally provide renewal options for terms not exceeding five additional years. leases for retail space are for terms ranging from five to 20
years, the majority of which are for ten years, and often contain multi-year renewal options.purchase commitments with contract
manufacturers and component suppliersthe company utilizes several contract manufacturers to manufacture sub-assemblies
for the companys products and to perform final assembly and test of finished products. these contract manufacturers acquire components and build product based on demand information supplied by the company, which typically covers periods
ranging from 30 to 150 days. the company also obtains individual components for its products from a wide variety of individual suppliers. consistent with industry practice, the company acquires components through a combination of purchase orders,
supplier contracts, and open orders based on projected demand information.41


## Item 7A


movements in either foreign exchange or interest rates. in addition, the timing of the accounting for recognition of gains and losses related to mark-to-market instruments for any given period
may not coincide with the timing of gains and losses related to the underlying economic exposures and, therefore, may adversely affect the companys financial condition and operating results.interest rate riskwhile the company is exposed to interest rate fluctuations in many of the worlds leading industrialized countries, the
companys interest income and expense is most sensitive to fluctuations in the general level of u.s. interest rates. as such, changes in u.s. interest rates affect the interest earned on the companys cash, cash equivalents and marketable
securities, the fair value of those investments, as well as costs associated with foreign currency hedges.the companys
investment policy and strategy are focused on preservation of capital and supporting the liquidity requirements of the company. a portion of the companys cash is managed by external managers within the guidelines of the companys
investment policy and to objective market benchmarks. the companys internal portfolio is benchmarked against external manager performance.the companys exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the companys investment portfolio. the company typically invests in highly rated securities and its
policy generally limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. the companys investment policy requires investments to be investment grade, primarily rated single-a or better, with the objective of minimizing the potential risk of
principal loss. all highly liquid investments with initial maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase are classified as cash equivalents. the company classifies its marketable securities as either short-term or long-term based on
each instruments underlying contractual maturity date. all short-term marketable securities have maturities less than 12 months, while all long-term marketable securities have maturities ranging from one to five years. the company may sell its
investments prior to their stated maturities for strategic purposes, in anticipation of credit deterioration, or for duration management. the company recognized no significant net gains or losses during 2010, 2009 and 2008 related to such sales.to provide a meaningful assessment of the interest rate risk associated with the companys investment portfolio, the
company performed a sensitivity analysis to determine the impact a change in interest rates would have on the value of the investment portfolio assuming a 100 basis point parallel shift in the yield curve. based on investment positions as of
september 25, 2010, a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates across all maturities would result in a $477 million incremental decline in the fair market value of the portfolio. as of september 26, 2009, a similar 100 basis
point shift in the yield curve would have resulted in a $176 million incremental decline in the fair market value of the portfolio. such losses would only be realized if the company sold the investments prior to maturity.foreign currency riskin general, the company is a net receiver of currencies other than the u.s. dollar. accordingly, changes in exchange rates, and in
particular a strengthening of the u.s. dollar, will negatively affect the companys net sales and gross margins as expressed in u.s. dollars. there is also a risk that the company will have to adjust local currency product pricing due to
competitive pressures when there has been significant volatility in foreign currency exchange rates.the company may enter
into foreign currency forward and option contracts with financial institutions to protect against foreign exchange risks associated with certain existing assets and liabilities, certain firmly committed transactions, forecasted future cash flows,
and net investments in foreign subsidiaries. generally, the companys practice is to hedge a majority of its material foreign exchange exposures, typically for three to six months.43



however, the company may choose not to hedge certain foreign exchange exposures for a variety of reasons, including but not limited to immateriality, accounting considerations and the prohibitive
economic cost of hedging particular exposures.to provide a meaningful assessment of the foreign currency risk associated
with certain of the companys foreign currency derivative positions, the company performed a sensitivity analysis using a value-at-risk (var) model to assess the potential impact of fluctuations in exchange rates. the var model
consisted of using a monte carlo simulation to generate thousands of random market price paths. the var is the maximum expected loss in fair value, for a given confidence interval, to the companys foreign exchange portfolio due to adverse
movements in rates. the var model is not intended to represent actual losses but is used as a risk estimation and management tool. the model assumes normal market conditions. forecasted transactions, firm commitments, and assets and liabilities
denominated in foreign currencies were excluded from the model. based on the results of the model, the company estimates with 95% confidence a maximum one-day loss in fair value of $103 million as of september 25, 2010 compared to a maximum
one-day loss in fair value of $44 million as of september 26, 2009. because the company uses foreign currency instruments for hedging purposes, losses incurred on those instruments are generally offset by increases in the fair value of the
underlying exposures.actual future gains and losses associated with the companys investment portfolio and derivative
positions may differ materially from the sensitivity analyses performed as of september 25, 2010 due to the inherent limitations associated with predicting the changes in the timing and amount of interest rates, foreign currency exchanges rates
and the companys actual exposures and positions.44

notes to consolidated financial statementsnote 1  summary of significant accounting policiesapple inc.
and its wholly-owned subsidiaries (collectively apple or the company) designs, manufactures, and markets personal computers, mobile communication and media devices, and portable digital music players, and sells a variety of
related software, services, peripherals, networking solutions, and third-party digital content and applications. the company sells its products worldwide through its retail stores, online stores, and direct sales force, and third-party cellular
network carriers, wholesalers, resellers and value-added resellers. in addition, the company sells a variety of third-party macintosh (mac), iphone, ipad and ipod compatible products including application software, printers, storage
devices, speakers, headphones, and various other accessories and supplies through its online and retail stores. the company sells to consumer, small and mid-sized business, education, enterprise, government and creative customers.basis of presentation and preparationthe accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the company. intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. the preparation of these consolidated financial
statements in conformity with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles (gaap) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in these consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes.
actual results could differ materially from those estimates. certain prior year amounts in the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto have been reclassified to conform to the current years presentation.the companys fiscal year is the 52 or 53-week period that ends on the last saturday of september. the companys fiscal years
2010, 2009 and 2008 ended on september 25, 2010, september 26, 2009 and september 27, 2008, respectively, and included 52 weeks each. an additional week is included in the first fiscal quarter approximately every six years to
realign fiscal quarters with calendar quarters. unless otherwise stated, references to particular years or quarters refer to the companys fiscal years ended in september and the associated quarters of those fiscal years.retrospective adoption of new accounting principlesin september 2009, the financial accounting standards board (fasb) amended the accounting standards related to revenue recognition for arrangements with multiple deliverables and arrangements
that include software elements (new accounting principles). the new accounting principles permitted prospective or retrospective adoption, and the company elected retrospective adoption during the first quarter of 2010.under the historical accounting principles, the company was required to account for sales of both iphone and apple tv using subscription
accounting because the company indicated it might from time-to-time provide future unspecified software upgrades and features for those products free of charge. under subscription accounting, revenue and associated product cost of sales for iphone
and apple tv were deferred at the time of sale and recognized on a straight-line basis over each products estimated economic life. this resulted in the deferral of significant amounts of revenue and cost of sales related to iphone and apple
tv.the new accounting principles affect the companys accounting for all past and current sales of iphone, ipad, apple
tv and for sales of ipod touch beginning in june 2010. the new accounting principles require the company to account for the sale of these devices as two deliverables. the first deliverable is the hardware and software essential to the functionality
of the hardware device delivered at the time of sale, and the second deliverable is the right included with the purchase of these devices to receive on a when-and-if-available basis, future unspecified software upgrades and features relating to the
products essential software. the new accounting principles result in the recognition of a substantial portion of the revenue and all product costs from50



the sale of these devices at the time of their sale. additionally, the company is required to estimate a standalone selling price for the unspecified software upgrade rights included with the
sale of these devices and recognizes that amount ratably over the 24-month estimated life of the related hardware device.refer to the explanatory note and note 2, retrospective adoption of new accounting principles in the 2009 form
10-k for additional information on the impact of adoption of the new accounting principles, which sections are incorporated herein by reference.revenue recognitionnet sales consist primarily of revenue from the sale
of hardware, software, digital content and applications, peripherals, and service and support contracts. the company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the sales price is fixed or
determinable, and collection is probable. product is considered delivered to the customer once it has been shipped and title and risk of loss have been transferred. for most of the companys product sales, these criteria are met at the time the
product is shipped. for online sales to individuals, for some sales to education customers in the u.s., and for certain other sales, the company defers revenue until the customer receives the product because the company legally retains a portion of
the risk of loss on these sales during transit. the company recognizes revenue from the sale of hardware products (e.g., macs, iphones, ipads, ipods and peripherals), software bundled with hardware that is essential to the functionality of the
hardware, and third-party digital content sold on the itunes store in accordance with general revenue recognition accounting guidance. the company recognizes revenue in accordance with industry specific software accounting guidance for the following
types of sales transactions: (i) standalone sales of software products, (ii) sales of software upgrades and (iii) sales of software bundled with hardware not essential to the functionality of the hardware.the company sells software and peripheral products obtained from other companies. the company generally establishes its own pricing and
retains related inventory risk, is the primary obligor in sales transactions with its customers, and assumes the credit risk for amounts billed to its customers. accordingly, the company generally recognizes revenue for the sale of products obtained
from other companies based on the gross amount billed. for certain sales made through the itunes store, including sales of third-party software applications for the companys ios devices, the company is not the primary obligor to users of the
software, and third-party developers determine the selling price of their software. therefore, the company accounts for such sales on a net basis by recognizing only the commission it retains from each sale and including that commission in net sales
in the consolidated statements of operations. the portion of the sales price paid by users that is remitted by the company to third-party developers is not reflected in the companys consolidated statement of operations.the company records deferred revenue when it receives payments in advance of the delivery of products or the performance of services.
this includes amounts that have been deferred related to embedded unspecified and specified software upgrades rights. the company sells gift cards redeemable at its retail and online stores, and also sells gift cards redeemable on the itunes store
for the purchase of content and software. the company records deferred revenue upon the sale of the card, which is relieved upon redemption of the card by the customer. revenue from applecare service and support contracts is deferred and recognized
ratably over the service coverage periods. applecare service and support contracts typically include extended phone support, repair services, web-based support resources and diagnostic tools offered under the companys standard limited
warranty.the company records reductions to revenue for estimated commitments related to price protection and for customer
incentive programs, including reseller and end-user rebates, and other sales programs and volume-based incentives. the estimated cost of these programs is recognized in the period the company has sold the product and committed to a plan. the company
also records reductions to revenue for expected future product returns based on the companys historical experience. revenue is recorded net of taxes collected from customers that are remitted to governmental authorities, with the collected
taxes recorded as current liabilities until remitted to the relevant government authority.51



revenue recognition for
arrangements with multiple deliverablesfor multi-element arrangements that include tangible products that contain
software that is essential to the tangible products functionality and undelivered software elements that relate to the tangible products essential software, the company allocates revenue to all deliverables based on their relative
selling prices. in such circumstances, the company uses a hierarchy to determine the selling price to be used for allocating revenue to deliverables: (i) vendor-specific objective evidence of fair value (vsoe), (ii) third-party
evidence of selling price (tpe), and (iii) best estimate of the selling price (esp). vsoe generally exists only when the company sells the deliverable separately and is the price actually charged by the company for that
deliverable. esps reflect the companys best estimates of what the selling prices of elements would be if they were sold regularly on a stand-alone basis.as described in more detail below, for all past and current sales of iphone, ipad, apple tv and for sales of ipod touch beginning in june 2010, the company has indicated it may from time-to-time provide
future unspecified software upgrades and features free of charge to customers. the company has identified two deliverables in arrangements involving the sale of these devices. the first deliverable is the hardware and software essential to the
functionality of the hardware device delivered at the time of sale. the second deliverable is the embedded right included with the purchase of iphone, ipad, ipod touch and apple tv to receive on a when-and-if-available basis, future unspecified
software upgrades and features relating to the products essential software. the company has allocated revenue between these two deliverables using the relative selling price method. because the company has neither vsoe nor tpe for the two
deliverables, the allocation of revenue has been based on the companys esps. amounts allocated to the delivered hardware and the related essential software are recognized at the time of sale provided the other conditions for revenue
recognition have been met. amounts allocated to the embedded unspecified software upgrade rights are deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis over the 24-month estimated life of each of these devices. all product cost of sales, including
estimated warranty costs, are recognized at the time of sale. costs for engineering and sales and marketing are expensed as incurred.the companys process for determining its esp for deliverables without vsoe or tpe considers multiple factors that may vary depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each
deliverable. the company believes its customers, particularly consumers, would be reluctant to buy unspecified software upgrade rights related to iphone, ipad, ipod touch and apple tv. this view is primarily based on the fact that unspecified
upgrade rights do not obligate the company to provide upgrades at a particular time or at all, and do not specify to customers which upgrades or features will be delivered. therefore, the company has concluded that if it were to sell upgrade rights
on a standalone basis, including those rights associated with iphone, ipad, ipod touch and apple tv, the selling price would be relatively low. key factors considered by the company in developing the esps for these upgrade rights include prices
charged by the company for similar offerings, the companys historical pricing practices, the nature of the upgrade rights (e.g., unspecified and when-and-if-available), and the relative esp of the upgrade rights as compared to the total
selling price of the product. the company may also consider, when appropriate, the impact of other products and services, including advertising services, on selling price assumptions when developing and reviewing its esps for software upgrade rights
and related deliverables. the company may also consider additional factors as appropriate, including the pricing of competitive alternatives if they exist, and product-specific business objectives.beginning in the third quarter of 2010 in conjunction with the announcement of ios 4, the companys esps for the embedded software
upgrade rights included with iphone, ipad and ipod touch reflect the positive financial impact expected by the company as a result of its introduction of a mobile advertising platform for these devices and the expectation of customers regarding
software that includes or supports an advertising component. ios 4 supports iad, the companys new mobile advertising platform, which enables applications on iphone, ipad and ipod touch to embed media-rich advertisements.for all periods presented, the companys esp for the embedded software upgrade right included with each apple tv sold is $10. the
companys esp for the software upgrade right included with each iphone sold through the52



companys second quarter of 2010 was $25. beginning in april 2010 in conjunction with the companys announcement of ios 4 for iphone, the company lowered its esp for the software
upgrade right included with each iphone to $10.beginning with initial sales of ipad in april 2010, the company has also
indicated it may from time-to-time provide future unspecified software upgrades and features free of charge to ipad customers. the companys esp for the embedded software upgrade right included with the sale of each ipad is $10. in june 2010,
the company announced that certain previously sold ipod touch models would receive an upgrade to ios 4 free of charge and indicated ipod touch devices running on ios 4 may from time-to-time receive future unspecified software upgrades and features
free of charge. the companys esp for the embedded software upgrade right included with each ipod touch sold beginning in june 2010 is $5.the company accounts for multiple element arrangements that consist only of software or software-related products, including the sale of upgrades to previously sold software, in accordance with industry
specific accounting guidance for software and software-related transactions. for such transactions, revenue on arrangements that include multiple elements is allocated to each element based on the relative fair value of each element, and fair value
is determined by vsoe. if the company cannot objectively determine the fair value of any undelivered element included in such multiple-element arrangements, the company defers revenue until all elements are delivered and services have been
performed, or until fair value can objectively be determined for any remaining undelivered elements. when the fair value of a delivered element has not been established, but fair value exists for the undelivered elements, the company uses the
residual method to recognize revenue. under the residual method, the fair value of the undelivered elements is deferred and the remaining portion of the arrangement fee is allocated to the delivered elements and is recognized as revenue.except as described for iphone, ipad, ipod touch and apple tv, the company generally does not offer unspecified upgrade rights to its
customers in connection with software sales or the sale of applecare extended warranty and support contracts. a limited number of the companys software products are available with maintenance agreements that grant customers rights to
unspecified future upgrades over the maintenance term on a when and if available basis. revenue associated with such maintenance is recognized ratably over the maintenance term.shipping costsfor all periods presented, amounts billed to customers
related to shipping and handling are classified as revenue, and the companys shipping and handling costs are included in cost of sales.warranty expensethe
company generally provides for the estimated cost of hardware and software warranties at the time the related revenue is recognized. the company assesses the adequacy of its pre-existing warranty liabilities and adjusts the amounts as necessary
based on actual experience and changes in future estimates.software development costsresearch and development costs are expensed as incurred. development costs of computer software to be sold, leased, or otherwise marketed
are subject to capitalization beginning when a products technological feasibility has been established and ending when a product is available for general release to customers. in most instances, the companys products are released soon
after technological feasibility has been established. therefore, costs incurred subsequent to achievement of technological feasibility are usually not significant, and generally most software development costs have been expensed as incurred.the company did not capitalize any software development costs during 2010. in 2009 and 2008, the company capitalized $71
million and $11 million, respectively, of costs associated with the development of mac os x53



version 10.6 snow leopard (mac os x snow leopard), which was released during the fourth quarter of 2009. the capitalized costs are being amortized to cost of sales on a straight-line
basis over a three year estimated useful life of the underlying technology.total amortization related to capitalized software
development costs was $48 million, $25 million and $27 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.advertising costsadvertising costs are expensed as incurred. advertising expense was $691 million, $501 million and $486 million for 2010, 2009 and 2008,
respectively.stock-based compensationthe company accounts for stock-based payment transactions in which the company receives employee services in exchange for (a) equity instruments of the enterprise or (b) liabilities that are
based on the fair value of the enterprises equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of such equity instruments. stock-based compensation cost for restricted stock units (rsus) is measured based on the closing fair
market value of the companys common stock on the date of grant. stock-based compensation cost for stock options is estimated at the grant date based on each options fair-value as calculated by the black-scholes-merton (bsm)
option-pricing model. the company recognizes stock-based compensation cost as expense ratably on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. the company will recognize a benefit from stock-based compensation in equity if an incremental
tax benefit is realized by following the ordering provisions of the tax law. in addition, the company accounts for the indirect effects of stock-based compensation on the research tax credit, the foreign tax credit and the domestic manufacturing
deduction through the income statement. further information regarding stock-based compensation can be found in note 7, shareholders equity and stock-based compensation of this form 10-k.income taxesthe
provision for income taxes is computed using the asset and liability method, under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax
bases of assets and liabilities, and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in effect for the years in which those tax
assets are expected to be realized or settled. the company records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is believed more likely than not to be realized.the company recognizes the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not the tax position will be
sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50%
likelihood of being realized upon settlement. see note 6, income taxes of this form 10-k for additional information.earnings
per common sharebasic earnings per common share is computed by dividing income available to common shareholders by the
weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. diluted earnings per common share is computed by dividing income available to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding
during the period increased to include the number of additional shares of common stock that would have been outstanding if the potentially dilutive securities had been issued.54

| Diluted earnings per common share | 15.15 | 9.08 | 6.78 |


potentially dilutive securities include outstanding stock options, shares to be purchased under the employee stock purchase plan and unvested rsus. the dilutive effect of potentially dilutive
securities is reflected in diluted earnings per common share by application of the treasury stock method. under the treasury stock method, an increase in the fair market value of the companys common stock can result in a greater dilutive
effect from potentially dilutive securities.the following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted earnings per
common share for the three years ended september 25, 2010 (in thousands, except net income in millions and per share amounts):numerator:net incomedenominator:weighted-average shares outstandingeffect of dilutive securitiesweighted-average diluted sharesbasic earnings per common sharediluted earnings per common sharepotentially dilutive
securities representing 1.6 million, 12.6 million and 10.3 million shares of common stock for 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively, were excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per common share for these periods because their
effect would have been antidilutive.financial instrumentscash equivalents and marketable securitiesall highly liquid investments
with maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase are classified as cash equivalents. the companys debt and marketable equity securities have been classified and accounted for as available-for-sale. management determines the
appropriate classification of its investments in debt securities at the time of purchase and reevaluates the available-for-sale designations as of each balance sheet date. the company classifies its marketable debt securities as either short-term or
long-term based on each instruments underlying contractual maturity date. marketable securities with maturities of less than 12 months are classified as short-term and marketable securities with maturities greater than 12 months are classified
as long-term. these securities are carried at fair value, with the unrealized gains and losses, net of taxes, reported as a component of shareholders equity. the cost of securities sold is based upon the specific identification method.derivative financial instrumentsthe company accounts for its derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities and carries them at fair value. derivatives that are not defined as hedges must be adjusted to fair value through
earnings.for derivative instruments that hedge the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows that are designated
as cash flow hedges, the effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative instrument is reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income in shareholders equity and reclassified into earnings in the same period or
periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. the ineffective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative instrument is recognized in current earnings. to receive hedge accounting treatment, cash flow hedges must be highly
effective in offsetting changes to expected future cash flows on hedged transactions. for options designated as cash flow hedges, changes in the time value are excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and are recognized in earnings. for
derivative instruments that hedge the exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset or a liability and that are designated as fair value hedges, the net gain or loss on the derivative instrument as well as the offsetting gain or loss on the
hedged item attributable to55



the hedged risk are recognized in earnings in the current period. the company did not have a net gain or loss on these derivative instruments during 2010, 2009 and 2008. the net gain or loss on
the effective portion of a derivative instrument that is designated as an economic hedge of the foreign currency translation exposure of the net investment in a foreign operation is reported in the same manner as a foreign currency translation
adjustment. for forward exchange contracts designated as net investment hedges, the company excludes changes in fair value relating to changes in the forward carry component from its definition of effectiveness. accordingly, any gains or losses
related to this component are recognized in current earnings.allowance for doubtful accountsthe company records its allowance for doubtful accounts based upon its assessment of various factors. the company considers historical
experience, the age of the accounts receivable balances, credit quality of the companys customers, current economic conditions, and other factors that may affect customers ability to pay.inventoriesinventories
are stated at the lower of cost, computed using the first-in, first-out method, or market. if the cost of the inventories exceeds their market value, provisions are made currently for the difference between the cost and the market value. the
companys inventories consist primarily of components and finished goods for all periods presented.property, plant and equipmentproperty, plant and equipment are stated at cost. depreciation is computed by use of the straight-line method over the
estimated useful lives of the assets, which for buildings is the lesser of 30 years or the remaining life of the underlying building, up to five years for equipment, and the shorter of lease terms or ten years for leasehold improvements. the company
capitalizes eligible costs to acquire or develop internal-use software that are incurred subsequent to the preliminary project stage. capitalized costs related to internal-use software are amortized using the straight-line method over the estimated
useful lives of the assets, which range from three to five years. depreciation and amortization expense on property and equipment was $815 million, $606 million and $387 million during 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.long-lived assets including goodwill and other acquired intangible assetsthe company reviews property, plant and equipment and certain identifiable intangibles, excluding goodwill, for impairment. long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. recoverability of these assets is measured by comparison of their carrying amounts to future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate. if property,
plant and equipment and certain identifiable intangibles are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized equals the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds its fair market value. the company did not record any
significant impairments during 2010, 2009 and 2008.the company does not amortize goodwill and intangible assets with
indefinite useful lives, rather such assets are required to be tested for impairment at least annually or sooner whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the assets may be impaired. the company performs its goodwill and intangible
asset impairment tests on or about august 31 of each year. the company did not recognize any goodwill or intangible asset impairment charges in 2010, 2009 and 2008. the company established reporting units based on its current reporting
structure. for purposes of testing goodwill for impairment, goodwill has been allocated to these reporting units to the extent it relates to each reporting unit.the company amortizes its intangible assets with definite lives over their estimated useful lives and reviews these assets for impairment. the company is currently amortizing its acquired intangible
assets with definite lives over periods ranging from three to ten years.56



fair value measurementsduring 2009, the company adopted the fasbs new accounting standard on fair value measurements and disclosures for
all financial assets and liabilities. the new accounting principles define fair value, provide a framework for measuring fair value, and expand the disclosures required for fair value measurements. during the first quarter of 2010, the company
adopted the new fair value accounting principles for all non-financial assets and non-financial liabilities, except for items that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis, which did not have a
material effect on the companys financial condition or operating results.the company applies fair value accounting for
all financial assets and liabilities and non-financial assets and liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis. the company defines fair value as the price that would be received from
selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. when determining the fair value measurements for assets and liabilities, which are required to be recorded at fair value,
the company considers the principal or most advantageous market in which the company would transact and the market-based risk measurements or assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, such as inherent risk,
transfer restrictions and credit risk. in accordance with the fair value accounting requirements, companies may choose to measure eligible financial instruments and certain other items at fair value. the company has not elected the fair value option
for any eligible financial instruments.foreign currency translation and remeasurementthe company translates the assets and liabilities of its non-u.s. dollar functional currency subsidiaries into u.s. dollars using exchange
rates in effect at the end of each period. revenue and expenses for these subsidiaries are translated using rates that approximate those in effect during the period. gains and losses from these translations are credited or charged to foreign
currency translation included in accumulated other comprehensive income in shareholders equity. the companys subsidiaries that use the u.s. dollar as their functional currency remeasure monetary assets and liabilities at exchange rates
in effect at the end of each period, and inventories, property, and nonmonetary assets and liabilities at historical rates. gains and losses from these remeasurements were insignificant and have been included in the companys results of
operations.segment informationthe company reports segment information based on the management approach. the management approach designates the internal reporting used by management for making decisions and assessing
performance as the source of the companys reportable segments. information about the companys products, major customers and geographic areas on a company-wide basis is also disclosed.business combinationsin december 2007, the fasb issued a new accounting standard for business combinations, which established principles and requirements for
how an acquirer is to recognize and measure in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree in a business combination. this new accounting standard also
established principles regarding how goodwill acquired in a business combination or a gain from a bargain purchase should be recognized and measured, requiring the capitalization of in-process research and development at fair value and the expensing
of acquisition-related costs as incurred, as well as providing guidelines on the disclosure requirements. in april 2009, the fasb amended this new accounting standard to require that assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination
that arise from contingencies be recognized at fair value, if the fair value can be determined during the measurement period. the company adopted the new business combination accounting standard in the first quarter of 2010 and applied these
principles to any business combinations completed in or after the first quarter of 2010. the adoption of the new business combination accounting standard did not have a material effect on the companys financial condition or operating results.57

the following tables
show the gross unrealized losses and fair value for investments in an unrealized loss position as of september 25, 2010 and september 26, 2009, aggregated by investment category and the length of time that individual securities have been
in a continuous loss position (in millions):certificates of deposit and time depositscorporate securitiesmunicipal securitiestotalcorporate securitiesthe company considers the declines in market value of its marketable securities investment portfolio to be
temporary in nature. the unrealized losses on the companys marketable securities were caused primarily by changes in market interest rates or widening credit spreads. the company typically invests in highly-rated securities, and its policy
generally limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. the companys investment policy requires investments to be investment grade, primarily rated single-a or better, with the objective of minimizing the potential risk of principal
loss. fair values were determined for each individual security in the investment portfolio. when evaluating the investments for other-than-temporary impairment, the company reviews factors such as the length of time and extent to which fair value
has been below cost basis, the financial condition of the issuer and any changes thereto, and the companys intent to sell, or whether it is more likely than not it will be required to sell, the investment before recovery of the
investments amortized cost basis. during the years ended september 25, 2010 and september 26, 2009, the company did not recognize any significant impairment charges. as of september 25, 2010, the company does not consider any of
its investments to be other-than-temporarily impaired.derivative financial instrumentsthe company uses derivatives to partially offset its business exposure to foreign currency exchange risk. the company may enter into
foreign currency forward and option contracts to offset some of the foreign exchange risk of expected future cash flows on certain forecasted revenue and cost of sales, of net investments in certain foreign subsidiaries, and on certain existing
assets and liabilities. to help protect gross margins from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, certain of the companys subsidiaries whose functional currency is the u.s. dollar, hedge a portion of forecasted foreign currency
revenue. the companys subsidiaries whose functional currency is not the u.s. dollar and who sell in local currencies, may hedge a portion of forecasted inventory purchases not denominated in the subsidiaries functional currencies. the
company typically hedges portions of its forecasted foreign currency exposure associated with revenue and inventory purchases for three to six months. to help protect the net investment in a foreign operation from adverse changes in foreign currency
exchange rates, the company may enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts to offset the changes in the carrying amounts of these investments due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. the company may also enter into
foreign currency forward and option contracts to partially offset the foreign currency exchange gains and losses generated by the re-measurement of certain assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies. however, the company may
choose not to hedge certain foreign currency exchange exposures for a variety of reasons, including but not limited to immateriality, accounting considerations and the prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures. there can be no
assurance the hedges will offset more than a portion of the financial impact resulting from movements in foreign currency exchange rates.60

the companys
accounting policies for these instruments are based on whether the instruments are designated as hedge or non-hedge instruments. the company records all derivatives on the consolidated balance sheets at fair value. the effective portions of cash
flow hedges are recorded in other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings. the effective portions of net investment hedges are recorded in other comprehensive income as a part of the cumulative translation adjustment.
derivatives that are not designated as hedging instruments and the ineffective portions of cash flow hedges and net investment hedges are adjusted to fair value through earnings in other income and expense.the company had a net deferred loss associated with cash flow hedges of approximately $252 million and a net deferred gain of $1 million,
net of taxes, recorded in other comprehensive income as of september 25, 2010 and september 26, 2009, respectively. other comprehensive income associated with cash flow hedges of foreign currency revenue is recognized as a component of net
sales in the same period as the related revenue is recognized, and other comprehensive income related to cash flow hedges of inventory purchases is recognized as a component of cost of sales in the same period as the related costs are recognized.
substantially all of the companys hedged transactions as of september 25, 2010 are expected to occur within six months.derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges must be de-designated as hedges when it is probable the forecasted hedged transaction will not occur in the initially identified time period or within
a subsequent two month time period. deferred gains and losses in other comprehensive income associated with such derivative instruments are reclassified immediately into earnings through other income and expense. any subsequent changes in fair value
of such derivative instruments also are reflected in current earnings unless they are re-designated as hedges of other transactions. the company did not recognize any significant net gains or losses related to the loss of hedge designation on
discontinued cash flow hedges during 2010, 2009 and 2008.the company had an unrealized net loss on net investment hedges of
$9 million and $2 million, net of taxes, included in the cumulative translation adjustment account of accumulated other comprehensive income (aoci) as of september 25, 2010 and september 26, 2009, respectively. the ineffective
portions and amounts excluded from the effectiveness test of net investment hedges are recorded in current earnings in other income and expense.the company recognized in earnings a net loss of $123 million and $133 million on foreign currency forward and option contracts not designated as hedging instruments during the year ended
september 25, 2010 and september 26, 2009, respectively. these amounts represent the net gain or loss on the derivative contracts and do not include changes in the related exposures, which generally offset a portion of the gain or loss on
the derivative contracts.the following table shows the notional principal and credit risk amounts of the companys
derivative instruments outstanding as of september 25, 2010 and september 26, 2009 (in millions):instruments qualifying as accounting hedges:foreign exchange contractsinstruments other than accounting hedges:foreign exchange contractsthe notional
principal amounts for derivative instruments provide one measure of the transaction volume outstanding and does not represent the amount of the companys exposure to credit or market loss. the credit risk amounts represent the companys
gross exposure to potential accounting loss on these transactions if all counterparties failed to perform according to the terms of the contract, based on then-current currency exchange rates at each respective date. the companys gross
exposure on these transactions may be further mitigated by61

collateral received from certain counterparties. the companys exposure to credit loss and market risk will vary over time as a function of currency exchange rates. although the table above
reflects the notional principal and credit risk amounts of the companys foreign exchange instruments, it does not reflect the gains or losses associated with the exposures and transactions that the foreign exchange instruments are intended to
hedge. the amounts ultimately realized upon settlement of these financial instruments, together with the gains and losses on the underlying exposures, will depend on actual market conditions during the remaining life of the instruments.the company generally enters into master netting arrangements, which reduce credit risk by permitting net settlement of transactions with
the same counterparty. to further limit credit risk, the company generally enters into collateral security arrangements that provide for collateral to be received or posted when the net fair value of certain financial instruments fluctuate from
contractually established thresholds. the company presents its derivative assets and derivative liabilities at their gross fair values. as of september 25, 2010, the company has posted cash collateral related to the derivative instruments
under its collateral security arrangements of $445 million and recorded the offsetting balance as other current assets in the consolidated balance sheet. the company did not record any significant amounts of cash collateral related to the derivative
instruments under its master netting arrangements as of september 26, 2009. the company did not have any derivative instruments with credit risk-related contingent features that would require it to post additional collateral as of
september 25, 2010 or september 26, 2009.the estimates of fair value are based on applicable and commonly used
pricing models and prevailing financial market information as of september 25, 2010. refer to note 3, fair value measurements of this form 10-k, for additional information on the fair value measurements for all financial assets and

company distributes its products through third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers and value-added resellers and directly to certain education, consumer and enterprise customers. the company generally does not require collateral
from its customers; however, the company will require collateral in certain instances to limit credit risk. in addition, when possible, the company attempts to limit credit risk on trade receivables with credit insurance for certain customers in
latin america, europe, asia, and australia, or by requiring third-party financing, loans or leases to support credit exposure. these credit-financing arrangements are directly between the third-party financing company and the end customer. as such,
the company generally does not assume any recourse or credit risk sharing related to any of these arrangements. however, considerable trade receivables not covered by collateral, third-party financing arrangements, or credit insurance are
outstanding with the companys third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers and value-added resellers. trade receivables from two of the companys customers accounted for 15% and 12% of trade receivables as of
september 25, 2010 and one of the companys customers accounted for 16% of trade receivables as of september 26, 2009. the companys cellular network carriers accounted for 64% and 51% of trade receivables as of

2010 and two of the companys vendors accounted for 40% and 36%, respectively, of non-trade receivables as of september 26, 2009. the company does not reflect the sale of these components in net sales and does not recognize any profits on
these sales until the related products are sold by the company, at which time any profit is recognized as a reduction of cost of sales.63

note 3  fair value
measurementsthe company defines fair value as the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer
a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. when determining the fair value measurements for assets and liabilities, which are required to be recorded at fair value, the company considers the principal
or most advantageous market in which the company would transact and the market-based risk measurements or assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, such as inherent risk, transfer restrictions and credit risk.the company applies the following fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value into three
levels and bases the categorization within the hierarchy upon the lowest level of input that is available and significant to the fair value measurement:level 1  quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.level 2  observable inputs other than quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in inactive markets,
or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.level 3  inputs that are generally unobservable and typically reflect managements estimates of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability.the companys valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of money market funds and certain marketable equity
securities were derived from quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. the valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of all other financial instruments, all of which have counterparties with high credit ratings,
were valued based on quoted market prices or model driven valuations using significant inputs derived from or corroborated by observable market data.assets/liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basisthe

note 6  income taxesthe provision for income taxes for the three years ended september 25, 2010, consisted of the following (in
millions):federal:currentdeferredstate:currentdeferredforeign:currentdeferredprovision for income taxesthe foreign provision for income taxes is based on foreign pretax earnings of $13.0 billion, $6.6 billion
and $4.6 billion in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. the companys consolidated financial statements provide for any related tax liability on amounts that may be repatriated, aside from undistributed earnings of certain of the companys
foreign subsidiaries that are intended to be indefinitely reinvested in operations outside the u.s. as of september 25, 2010, u.s. income taxes have not been provided on a cumulative total of $12.3 billion of such earnings. the amount of
unrecognized deferred tax liability related to these temporary differences is estimated to be approximately $4.0 billion.as
of september 25, 2010 and september 26, 2009, $30.8 billion and $17.4 billion, respectively, of the companys cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities were held by foreign subsidiaries and are generally based in u.s.
dollar-denominated holdings. amounts held by foreign subsidiaries are generally subject to u.s. income taxation on repatriation to the u.s.deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect the effects of tax losses, credits, and the future income tax effects of temporary differences between the consolidated financial statement carrying amounts of
existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and are measured using enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.68

income taxes payable have been reduced by the tax benefits from employee stock plan awards. for stock options, the company receives an income tax benefit calculated as the difference between the fair market value of the stock issued at the time of
the exercise and the option price, tax effected. for rsus, the company receives an income tax benefit upon the awards vesting equal to the tax effect of the underlying stocks fair market value. the company had net excess tax
benefits from employee stock plan awards of $742 million, $246 million and $770 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively, which were reflected as increases to common stock.uncertain tax positionstax positions are evaluated in a two-step process.
the company first determines whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination. if a tax position meets the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold it is then measured to determine the amount of benefit to
recognize in the financial statements. the tax position is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. the company classifies gross interest and penalties and unrecognized tax
benefits that are not expected to result in payment or receipt of cash within one year as non-current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets.as of september 25, 2010, the total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits was $943 million, of which $404 million, if recognized, would affect the companys effective tax rate. as of
september 26, 2009, the total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits was $971 million, of which $307 million, if recognized, would affect the companys effective tax rate.69

income taxes. as of september 25, 2010 and september 26, 2009, the total amount of gross interest and penalties accrued was $247 million and $291 million, respectively, which is classified as non-current liabilities in the consolidated
balance sheets. in 2010 and 2009, the company recognized an interest benefit of $43 million and interest expense of $64 million, respectively, in connection with tax matters.the company is subject to taxation and files income tax returns in the u.s. federal jurisdiction and in many state and foreign jurisdictions. for u.s. federal income tax purposes, all years prior to 2004
are closed. the internal revenue service (the irs) has completed its field audit of the companys federal income tax returns for the years 2004 through 2006 and proposed certain adjustments. the company has contested certain of
these adjustments through the irs appeals office. the irs is currently examining the years 2007 through 2009. during the third quarter of 2010, the company reached a tax settlement with the irs for the years 2002 through 2003. in connection with the
settlement, the company reduced its gross unrecognized tax benefits by $100 million and recognized a $52 million tax benefit in the third quarter of 2010. in addition, the company is also subject to audits by state, local and foreign tax
authorities. in major states and major foreign jurisdictions, the years subsequent to 1988 and 2001, respectively, generally remain open and could be subject to examination by the taxing authorities.management believes that an adequate provision has been made for any adjustments that may result from tax examinations. however, the
outcome of tax audits cannot be predicted with certainty. if any issues addressed in the companys tax audits are resolved in a manner not consistent with managements expectations, the company could be required to adjust its provision for
income tax in the period such resolution occurs. although timing of the resolution and/or closure of audits is not certain, the company does not believe it is reasonably possible that its unrecognized tax benefits would materially change in the next
12 months.note 7  shareholders equity and stock-based compensationpreferred stockthe

employees, including executive officers. the 2003 plan permits the granting of incentive stock options, nonstatutory stock options, rsus, stock appreciation rights, stock purchase rights and performance-based awards. options granted under the 2003
plan generally expire seven to ten years after the grant date and generally become exercisable over a period of four years, based on continued employment, with either annual, semi-annual or quarterly vesting. in general, rsus granted under the 2003
plan vest over two to four years, are subject to the employees continued employment and are paid upon vesting in shares of the companys common stock on a one-for-one basis. at the companys 2010 annual meeting of shareholders, the
2003 plan was amended to (i) increase the number of shares of the companys common stock that may be delivered pursuant to awards granted under the 2003 plan by an additional 36,000,000 shares and (ii) extend the companys
authority to grant awards under the 2003 plan intended to qualify as performance-based awards within the meaning of section 162(m) of the u.s. internal revenue code through the 2015 annual meeting of shareholders. as of
september 25, 2010, approximately 62.5 million shares were reserved for future issuance under the 2003 plan.71



1997 employee stock option planin august 1997, the companys board of directors approved the 1997 employee stock option plan (the 1997
plan), a non-shareholder approved plan for grants of stock options to employees who are not officers of the company. options granted under the 1997 plan generally expire seven to ten years after the grant date. all stock options granted under
the 1997 plan are fully vested. in october 2003, the company terminated the 1997 plan, and no new options can be granted from this plan.1997 director stock planin august 1997, the companys board of directors (the board) adopted a director stock option plan, which was
subsequently renamed the 1997 director stock plan (the director plan) and has been approved by shareholders. as amended, the director plan (i) permits the company to grant awards of rsus or stock options to the companys
non-employee directors, (ii) beginning february 25, 2010, provides for automatic initial grants of rsus upon a non-employee director joining the board and automatic annual grants of rsus at each annual meeting of shareholders, and
(iii) permits the board to prospectively change the relative mixture of stock options and rsus for the initial and annual award grants and the methodology for determining the number of shares of the companys common stock subject to these
grants without shareholder approval. each share issued with respect to rsus granted under the plan reduces the number of shares available for grant under the plan by two shares. the director plan expires november 9, 2019. as of september 25,
2010, approximately 199,000 shares were reserved for future issuance under the director plan.rule 10b5-1 trading plansduring the fourth quarter of 2010, executive officers timothy d. cook, peter oppenheimer, d. bruce sewell, philip w. schiller and bertrand
serlet had trading plans pursuant to rule 10b5-1(c)(1) of the securities exchange act of 1934, as amended (the exchange act). a trading plan is a written document that pre-establishes the amounts, prices and dates (or formula for
determining the amounts, prices and dates) of future purchases or sales of the companys stock including the exercise and sale of employee stock options and shares acquired pursuant to the companys employee stock purchase plan and upon
vesting of rsus.employee stock purchase planthe company has a shareholder approved employee stock purchase plan (the purchase plan), under which substantially all employees may purchase the companys common stock through payroll
deductions at a price equal to 85% of the lower of the fair market values of the stock as of the beginning and end of six-month offering periods. an employees payroll deductions under the purchase plan are limited to 10% of the employees
compensation and employees may not purchase more than $25,000 of stock for any calendar year. additionally, no more than 1,000,000 shares may be purchased in the aggregate in any one offering period. as of september 25, 2010,
approximately 3.8 million shares were reserved for future issuance under the purchase plan.employee savings planthe company has an employee savings plan (the savings plan) qualifying as a deferred salary arrangement under
section 401(k) of the internal revenue code. under the savings plan, participating u.s. employees may defer a portion of their pre-tax earnings, up to the irs annual contribution limit ($16,500 for calendar year 2010). the company matches 50%
to 100% of each employees contributions, depending on length of service, up to a maximum 6% of the employees eligible earnings. the companys matching contributions to the savings plan were $72 million, $59 million and $50 million
in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.72

2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. upon vesting, the rsus are generally net share-settled to cover the required withholding tax and the remaining amount is converted into an equivalent number of shares of common stock. the majority of rsus that
vested in 2010, 2009 and 2008, were net-share settled such that the company withheld shares with value equivalent to the employees minimum statutory obligation for the applicable income and other employment taxes, and remitted the cash to the
appropriate taxing authorities. the total shares withheld were approximately 1.8 million, 707,000 and 857,000 for 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively, and were based on the value of the rsus on their vesting date as determined by the
companys closing stock price. total payments for the employees tax obligations to the taxing authorities were $406 million, $82 million and $124 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively, and are reflected as a financing activity
within the consolidated statements of cash flows. these net-share settlements had the effect of share repurchases by the company as they reduced and retired the number of shares that would have otherwise been issued as a result of the vesting
and did not represent an expense to the company.73

stock-based compensationstock-based compensation cost for rsus is measured based on the closing fair market value of the companys common
stock on the date of grant. stock-based compensation cost for stock options and employee stock purchase plan rights (stock purchase rights) is estimated at the grant date and offering date, respectively, based on the fair-value as
calculated by the bsm option-pricing model. the bsm option-pricing model incorporates various assumptions including expected volatility, expected life and interest rates. the expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of the
companys common stock over the most recent period commensurate with the estimated expected life of the companys stock options and other relevant factors including implied volatility in market traded options on the companys common
stock. the company bases its expected life assumption on its historical experience and on the terms and conditions of the stock awards it grants to employees. the company recognizes stock-based compensation cost as expense ratably on a straight-line
basis over the requisite service period.the weighted-average assumptions used for stock options granted do not apply to
employee stock options assumed in conjunction with business acquisitions during the year ended september 25, 2010. the weighted-average fair value of stock options assumed during the year ended september 25, 2010 was $216.82. there were no
stock options assumed during 2009 and 2008. the weighted-average assumptions used for the three years ended september 25, 2010, and the resulting estimates of weighted-average fair value per share of options granted and of stock purchase rights

major facility leases are typically for terms not exceeding 10 years and generally provide renewal options for terms not exceeding five additional years. leases for retail space are for terms
ranging from five to 20 years, the majority of which are for ten years, and often contain multi-year renewal options. as of september 25, 2010, the companys total future minimum lease payments under noncancelable operating leases were
$2.1 billion, of which $1.7 billion related to leases for retail space.rent expense under all operating leases, including
both cancelable and noncancelable leases, was $271 million, $231 million and $207 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. future minimum lease payments under noncancelable operating leases having remaining terms in excess of one year as of

company also offers a 90-day basic warranty for its service parts used to repair the companys hardware products. the company provides currently for the estimated cost that may be incurred under its basic limited product warranties at the time
related revenue is recognized. factors considered in determining appropriate accruals for product warranty obligations include the size of the installed base of products subject to warranty protection, historical and projected warranty claim rates,
historical and projected cost-per-claim, and knowledge of specific product failures that are outside of the companys typical experience. the company assesses the adequacy of its pre-existing warranty liabilities and adjusts the amounts as
necessary based on actual experience and changes in future estimates.the company periodically provides updates to its
applications and system software to maintain the softwares compliance with published specifications. the estimated cost to develop such updates is accounted for as warranty costs that are recognized at the time related software revenue is
recognized. factors considered in determining appropriate accruals related to such updates include the number of units delivered, the number of updates expected to occur, and the historical cost and estimated future cost of the resources necessary
to develop these updates.the following table reconciles changes in the companys accrued warranty and related costs for
the three years ended september 25, 2010 (in millions):beginning accrued warranty and related costscost of warranty claimsaccruals for product warrantyending accrued warranty and related coststhe company generally does not indemnify end-users of its operating system and application software against
legal claims that the software infringes third-party intellectual property rights. other agreements entered into by76



the company sometimes include indemnification provisions under which the company could be subject to costs and/or damages in the event of an infringement claim against the company or an
indemnified third-party. however, the company has not been required to make any significant payments resulting from such an infringement claim asserted against it or an indemnified third-party and, in the opinion of management, does not have a
potential liability related to unresolved infringement claims subject to indemnification that would materially adversely affect its financial condition or operating results. therefore, the company did not record a liability for infringement costs as
of either september 25, 2010 or september 26, 2009.the company has entered into indemnification agreements with
its directors and executive officers. under these agreements, the company has agreed to indemnify such individuals to the fullest extent permitted by law against liabilities that arise by reason of their status as directors or officers and to
advance expenses incurred by such individuals in connection with related legal proceedings. it is not possible to determine the maximum potential amount of payments the company could be required to make under these agreements due to the limited
history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each claim. however, the company maintains directors and officers liability insurance coverage to reduce its exposure to such obligations, and payments made
under these agreements historically have not materially adversely affected the companys financial condition or operating results.concentrations in the available sources of supply of materials and productalthough most components essential to the companys business are generally available from multiple sources, certain key components
including but not limited to microprocessors, enclosures, certain liquid crystal displays (lcds), certain optical drives and application-specific integrated circuits (asics) are currently obtained by the company from single
or limited sources, which subjects the company to significant supply and pricing risks. many of these and other key components that are available from multiple sources including but not limited to nand flash memory, dynamic random access memory
(dram) and certain lcds, are subject at times to industry-wide shortages and significant commodity pricing fluctuations. in addition, the company has entered into certain agreements for the supply of key components including but not
limited to microprocessors, nand flash memory, dram and lcds at favorable pricing, but there is no guarantee that the company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar favorable terms, or at all, upon expiration or otherwise obtain
favorable pricing in the future. therefore, the company remains subject to significant risks of supply shortages and/or price increases that can materially adversely affect its financial condition and operating results.the company and other participants in the personal computer, and mobile communication and media device industries also compete for
various components with other industries that have experienced increased demand for their products. in addition, the company uses some custom components that are not common to the rest of these industries, and new products introduced by the company
often utilize custom components available from only one source. when a component or product uses new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers yields have matured or manufacturing capacity has increased. if the
companys supply of a key single-sourced component for a new or existing product were delayed or constrained, if such components were available only at significantly higher prices, or if a key manufacturing vendor delayed shipments of completed
products to the company, the companys financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected. the companys business and financial performance could also be adversely affected depending on the time required to
obtain sufficient quantities from the original source, or to identify and obtain sufficient quantities from an alternative source. continued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at all, may be affected if those suppliers decided
to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the companys requirements.substantially all of the companys macs, iphones, ipads, ipods, logic boards and other assembled products are now manufactured by
outsourcing partners, primarily in various parts of asia. a significant concentration of this outsourced manufacturing is currently performed by only a few outsourcing partners of the company, often in single locations. certain of these outsourcing
partners are the sole-sourced supplier of components and manufacturing outsourcing for many of the companys key products including but not limited to final assembly77



of substantially all of the companys macs, iphones, ipads and ipods. although the company works closely with its outsourcing partners on manufacturing schedules, the companys
operating results could be adversely affected if its outsourcing partners were unable to meet their production commitments. the companys purchase commitments typically cover its requirements for periods ranging from 30 to 150 days.long-term supply agreementsthe company has entered into prepaid long-term supply agreements to secure the supply of certain inventory components, which generally expire between 2011 and 2015. as of september 25, 2010, the
company had a total of $956 million of inventory component prepayments outstanding, of which $157 million is classified as other current assets and $799 million is classified as other assets in the consolidated balance sheets. in august 2010, the
company entered into a long-term supply agreement under which it has committed to prepay $500 million in 2011. the company had a total of $1.2 billion of inventory component prepayments outstanding as of september 26, 2009. these prepayments
will be applied to certain inventory component purchases made over the life of each respective agreement.contingenciesthe company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that have arisen in the ordinary course of business and have not been fully
adjudicated, which are discussed in part i, item 3 of this form 10-k under the heading legal proceedings. in the opinion of management, the company does not have a potential liability related to any current legal proceedings and
claims that would individually or in the aggregate materially adversely affect its financial condition or operating results. however, the results of legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty. if the company failed to prevail in any of
these legal matters or if several of these legal matters were resolved against the company in the same reporting period, the operating results of a particular reporting period could be materially adversely affected.on march 14, 2008, mirror worlds, llc filed an action against the company alleging that certain of its products infringed on
three patents covering technology used to display files. on october 1, 2010, a jury returned a verdict against the company, and awarded damages of $208 million per patent for each of the three patents asserted. the company is challenging
the verdict, believes it has valid defenses and has not recorded a loss contingency at this time.production and marketing of
products in certain states and countries may subject the company to environmental, product safety and other regulations including, in some instances, the requirement to provide customers the ability to return product at the end of its useful life,
and place responsibility for environmentally safe disposal or recycling with the company. such laws and regulations have been passed in several jurisdictions in which the company operates, including various countries within europe and asia and
certain states and provinces within north america. although the company does not anticipate any material adverse effects in the future based on the nature of its operations and the thrust of such laws, there is no assurance that such existing laws
or future laws will not materially adversely affect the companys financial condition or operating results.note 9 
segment information and geographic datathe company reports segment information based on the management
approach. the management approach designates the internal reporting used by management for making decisions and assessing performance as the source of the companys reportable segments.the company manages its business primarily on a geographic basis. accordingly, the company determined its operating and reporting
segments, which are generally based on the nature and location of its customers, to be the americas, europe, japan, asia-pacific and retail operations. the americas, europe, japan and asia-pacific reportable segment results do not include results of
the retail segment. the americas segment includes both north and south america. the europe segment includes european countries, as well as the middle east and78



africa. the asia-pacific segment includes australia and asia, but does not include japan. the retail segment operates apple retail stores in 11 countries, including the u.s. each reportable
operating segment provides similar hardware and software products and similar services. the accounting policies of the various segments are the same as those described in note 1, summary of significant accounting policies.the company evaluates the performance of its operating segments based on net sales and operating income. net sales for geographic
segments are generally based on the location of customers, while retail segment net sales are based on sales from the companys retail stores. operating income for each segment includes net sales to third parties, related cost of sales and
operating expenses directly attributable to the segment. advertising expenses are generally included in the geographic segment in which the expenditures are incurred. operating income for each segment excludes other income and expense and certain
expenses managed outside the operating segments. costs excluded from segment operating income include various corporate expenses, such as manufacturing costs and variances not included in standard costs, research and development, corporate marketing
expenses, stock-based compensation expense, income taxes, various nonrecurring charges, and other separately managed general and administrative costs. the company does not include intercompany transfers between segments for management reporting
purposes. segment assets exclude corporate assets, such as cash, short-term and long-term investments, manufacturing and corporate facilities, miscellaneous corporate infrastructure, goodwill and other acquired intangible assets. except for the
retail segment, capital asset purchases for long-lived assets are not reported to management by segment. cash payments for capital asset purchases by the retail segment were $392 million, $369 million and $389 million for 2010, 2009 and 2008,
respectively.the company has certain retail stores that have been designed and built to serve as high-profile venues to
promote brand awareness and serve as vehicles for corporate sales and marketing activities. because of their unique design elements, locations and size, these stores require substantially more investment than the companys more typical retail
stores. the company allocates certain operating expenses associated with its high-profile stores to corporate marketing expense to reflect the estimated company-wide benefit. the allocation of these operating costs to corporate expense is based on
the amount incurred for a high-profile store in excess of that incurred by a more typical company retail location. the company had opened a total of 15 high-profile stores as of september 25, 2010. amounts allocated to corporate expense
resulting from the operations of high-profile stores were $75 million, $65 million and $53 million for 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.79

shareholders equity and cash flows for the years then ended. these financial statements are the responsibility of the companys management. our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.we conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board (united states).
those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. an audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements. an audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. we believe that our audits

report of
ernst & young llp, independent registered public accounting firmthe board of directors and shareholders of apple inc.we have audited apple inc.s internal control over financial reporting as of september 25, 2010, based on criteria
established in internal control  integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission (the coso criteria). apple inc.s management is responsible for maintaining effective
internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying managements annual report on internal control over financial reporting. our
responsibility is to express an opinion on the companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.we conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board (united states). those standards
require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control
over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered
necessary in the circumstances. we believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.a companys
internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles. a companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions
and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that
receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. also, projections
of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.in our opinion, apple inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of
september 25, 2010, based on the coso criteria.we also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the public
company accounting oversight board (united states), the 2010 consolidated financial statements of apple inc. and our report dated october 27, 2010 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon./s/ ernst & young llpsan jose, californiaoctober 27, 201084

none.evaluation of
disclosure controls and proceduresbased on an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of the
companys management, the companys principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that the companys disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the exchange act
were effective as of september 25, 2010 to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by the company in reports that it files or submits under the exchange act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported
within the time periods specified in the securities and exchange commission rules and forms and (ii) accumulated and communicated to the companys management, including its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as
appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.inherent limitations over internal controlsthe companys internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of
financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with gaap. the companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that:pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the
companys assets;provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with gaap, and
that the companys receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of the companys management and directors; andprovide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets
that could have a material effect on the financial statements.management, including the companys
chief executive officer and chief financial officer, does not expect that the companys internal controls will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. a control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable,
not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs.
because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of internal controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. also, any evaluation of the effectiveness of
controls in future periods are subject to the risk that those internal controls may become inadequate because of changes in business conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.managements annual report on internal control over financial reportingthe companys management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as
