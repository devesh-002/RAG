## Item 1A


development and/or manufacture products resulting in product delays; inability of customers, including channel partners, to obtain credit to finance purchases of the companys
products; and failure of derivative counterparties and other financial institutions. other income and expense also could vary materially from expectations depending on gains or losses realized on the sale or exchange of financial
instruments; impairment charges resulting from revaluations of debt and equity securities and other investments; interest rates; cash balances; and changes in fair value of derivative instruments. increased volatility in the financial
markets and overall economic uncertainty would increase the risk of the actual amounts realized in the future on the companys financial instruments differing significantly from the fair values currently assigned to them.global markets for the companys products and services are highly competitive and subject to rapid technological
change, and the company may be unable to compete effectively in these markets.the companys products and services
compete in highly competitive global markets characterized by aggressive price cutting and resulting downward pressure on gross margins, frequent introduction of new products, short product life cycles, evolving industry standards, continual
improvement in product price/performance characteristics, rapid adoption of technological and product advancements by competitors, and price sensitivity on the part of consumers.the companys ability to compete successfully depends heavily on its ability to ensure a continuing and timely introduction of
innovative new products and technologies to the marketplace. the company believes it is unique in that it designs and develops nearly the entire solution for its products, including the hardware, operating system, numerous software applications, and
related services. as a result, the company must make significant investments in research and development and currently holds a significant number of patents and copyrights and has registered and/or has applied to register numerous patents,
trademarks and service marks. in contrast, many of the companys competitors seek to compete primarily through aggressive pricing and very low cost structures, and emulating the companys products and
infringing its intellectual property. if the company is unable to continue to develop and sell innovative new products with attractive margins or if competitors infringe on the companys intellectual property, the companys
ability to maintain a competitive advantage could be adversely affected.the company markets certain mobile communication and
media devices based on the ios mobile operating system and also markets related third-party digital content and applications. the company faces substantial competition in these markets from companies that have significant technical, marketing,
distribution and other resources, as well as established hardware, software and digital content supplier relationships. additionally, the company faces significant price competition as competitors reduce their selling prices and attempt to imitate
the companys product features and applications within their own products or, alternatively, collaborate with each other to offer solutions that are more competitive than those they currently offer. the company also competes with illegitimate
ways to obtain third-party digital content and applications. the company has entered the mobile communications and media device markets, and some of its competitors in these markets have greater experience, product breadth and distribution channels
than the company. because some current and potential competitors have substantial resources and/or experience and a lower cost structure, they may be able to provide such products and services at little or no profit or even at a loss. the company
also expects competition to intensify as competitors attempt to imitate the companys approach to providing these components seamlessly within their individual offerings or work collaboratively to offer integrated solutions. the companys
financial condition and operating results depend substantially on the companys ability to continually improve ios and ios devices in order to maintain their functional and design advantages.the company is the only authorized maker of hardware using os x, which has a minority market share in the personal computer market. this
market is dominated by computer makers using competing operating systems, most notably windows. in the market for personal computers and peripherals, the company faces a significant number of competitors, many of which have broader product lines,
lower priced products, and a larger installed customer base. historically, consolidation in this market has resulted in larger competitors. price competition has10



been particularly intense as competitors selling windows-based personal computers have aggressively cut prices and lowered product margins. an increasing number of internet-enabled devices that
include software applications and are smaller and simpler than traditional personal computers compete for market share with the companys existing products. the companys financial condition and operating results depend substantially on
its ability to continually improve the mac platform to maintain its functional and design advantages.there can be no
assurance the company will be able to continue to provide products and services that compete effectively.to remain
competitive and stimulate customer demand, the company must successfully manage frequent product introductions and transitions.due to the highly volatile and competitive nature of the industries in which the company competes, the company must continually introduce new products, services and technologies, enhance existing products
and services, and effectively stimulate customer demand for new and upgraded products. the success of new product introductions depends on a number of factors including, but not limited to, timely and successful product development, market
acceptance, the companys ability to manage the risks associated with new product production ramp-up issues, the availability of application software for new products, the effective management of purchase commitments and inventory levels in
line with anticipated product demand, the availability of products in appropriate quantities and costs to meet anticipated demand, and the risk that new products may have quality or other defects in the early stages of introduction. accordingly, the
company cannot determine in advance the ultimate effect of new product introductions and transitions.the company faces
substantial inventory and other asset risk in addition to purchase commitment cancellation risk.the company records a
write-down for product and component inventories that have become obsolete or exceed anticipated demand or net realizable value and accrues necessary cancellation fee reserves for orders of excess products and components. the company also reviews
its long-lived assets, including capital assets held at its suppliers facilities, for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. if the company determines that impairment has
occurred, it records a write-down equal to the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds its fair market value. although the company believes its provisions related to inventory, capital assets, other assets and purchase commitments
are currently adequate, no assurance can be given that the company will not incur additional related charges given the rapid and unpredictable pace of product obsolescence in the industries in which the company competes.the company must order components for its products and build inventory in advance of product announcements and shipments. consistent with
industry practice, components are normally acquired through a combination of purchase orders, supplier contracts, open orders and, where appropriate, inventory component prepayments, in each case based on projected demand. such purchase commitments
typically cover forecasted component and manufacturing requirements for periods up to 150 days. because the companys markets are volatile, competitive and subject to rapid technology and price changes, there is a risk the company will forecast
incorrectly and order or produce excess or insufficient amounts of components or products, or not fully utilize firm purchase commitments.future operating results depend upon the companys ability to obtain components in sufficient quantities.because the company currently obtains components from single or limited sources, the company is subject to significant supply and pricing
risks. many components, including those that are available from multiple sources, are at times subject to industry-wide shortages and significant commodity pricing fluctuations. while the company has entered into various agreements for the supply of
components, there can be no assurance that the company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms, or at all. the follow-on effects from11



global economic conditions on the companys suppliers, described in global economic conditions could materially adversely affect the company above, also could affect
the companys ability to obtain components. therefore, the company remains subject to significant risks of supply shortages and price increases. the company expects to experience decreases in its gross margin percentage in future
periods, as compared to levels achieved during 2012, largely due to a higher mix of new and innovative products with flat or reduced pricing that have higher cost structures and deliver greater value to customers and anticipated component cost and
other cost increases. future strengthening of the u.s. dollar could also negatively impact gross margin.the company and
other participants in the markets for mobile communication and media devices and personal computers also compete for various components with other industries that have experienced increased demand for their products. the company uses some custom
components that are not common to the rest of these industries. the companys new products often utilize custom components available from only one source. when a component or product uses new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist
until the suppliers yields have matured or manufacturing capacity has increased. continued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at all, may be affected if those suppliers decided to concentrate on the production of common
components instead of components customized to meet the companys requirements. the supply of components for a new or existing product could be delayed or constrained, or a key manufacturing vendor could delay shipments of completed products to
the company.the company depends on component and product manufacturing and logistical services provided by outsourcing partners, many of
whom are located outside of the u.s.substantially all of the companys manufacturing is performed in whole or in
part by a few outsourcing partners located primarily in asia. the company has also outsourced much of its transportation and logistics management. while these arrangements may lower operating costs, they also reduce the companys direct control
over production and distribution. it is uncertain what effect such diminished control will have on the quality or quantity of products or services, or the companys flexibility to respond to changing conditions. although arrangements with these
partners may contain provisions for warranty expense reimbursement, the company may remain responsible to the consumer for warranty service in the event of product defects and could experience an unanticipated product defect or warranty liability.
while the company relies on its partners to adhere to its supplier code of conduct, material violations of the supplier code of conduct could occur.the supply and manufacture of many critical components is performed by sole-sourced outsourcing partners in the u.s., asia and europe. outsourcing partners in asia perform final assembly of substantially
all of the companys hardware products. manufacturing or logistics in these locations or transit to final destinations may be disrupted for a variety of reasons including, but not limited to, natural and man-made disasters, information
technology system failures, military actions or economic, business, labor, environmental, public health, or political issues.the company relies on third-party intellectual property and digital content, which may not be available to the company on commercially
reasonable terms or at all.many of the companys products include third-party intellectual property, which requires
licenses from those third parties. based on past experience and industry practice, the company believes such licenses generally can be obtained on reasonable terms. there is, however, no assurance that the necessary licenses can be obtained on
acceptable terms or at all.the company also contracts with third parties to offer their digital content through the itunes
store. the licensing arrangements with these third parties are short-term and do not guarantee the continuation or renewal of these arrangements on reasonable terms, if at all. some third-party content providers and distributors currently or in the
future may offer competing products and services, and could take action to make it more difficult or impossible for the company to license their content in the future. other content owners, providers or distributors12



may seek to limit the companys access to, or increase the cost of, such content. the company may be unable to continue to offer a wide variety of content at reasonable prices with
acceptable usage rules, or continue to expand its geographic reach.many third-party content providers require the company to
provide digital rights management and other security solutions. if requirements change, the company may have to develop or license new technology to provide these solutions. there is no assurance the company will be able to develop or license such
solutions at a reasonable cost and in a timely manner. in addition, certain countries have passed or may propose and adopt legislation that would force the company to license its digital rights management, which could lessen the protection of
content and subject it to piracy and also could negatively affect arrangements with the companys content providers.the company is frequently involved in intellectual property litigation, and could be found to have infringed on intellectual property
rights.technology companies, including many of the companys competitors, frequently enter into litigation based on
allegations of patent infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. in addition, patent holding companies seek to monetize patents they have purchased or otherwise obtained. as the company has grown, the intellectual property
rights claims against it have increased and may continue to increase. in particular, the companys cellular enabled products compete with mobile communication and media device companies that hold significant patent portfolios, and the number of
patent claims against the company has significantly increased. the company is vigorously defending infringement actions in courts in a number of u.s. jurisdictions and before the u.s. international trade commission, as well as internationally
in europe and asia. the plaintiffs in these actions frequently seek injunctions and substantial damages.regardless of the
scope or validity of such patents or other intellectual property rights, or the merits of any claims by potential or actual litigants, the company may have to engage in protracted litigation. such litigation is often expensive, time-consuming,
disruptive to the companys operations, and distracting to management. if the company is found to infringe one or more patents or other intellectual property rights, regardless of whether it can develop non-infringing technology, it may be
required to pay substantial damages or royalties to a third-party, or it may be subject to a temporary or permanent injunction prohibiting the company from marketing or selling certain products.in certain cases, the company may consider the desirability of entering into licensing agreements, although no assurance can be given
that such licenses can be obtained on acceptable terms or that litigation will not occur. these licenses may also significantly increase the companys operating expenses.in managements opinion, there is not at least a reasonable possibility the company may have incurred a material loss, or a material loss in excess of a recorded accrual, with respect to loss
contingencies, including matters related to infringement of intellectual property rights. however, the outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain. therefore, although management considers the likelihood of such an outcome to be remote, if one or
more of these legal matters were resolved against the company in a reporting period for amounts in excess of managements expectations, the companys consolidated financial statements for that reporting period could be materially adversely
affected.the companys future performance depends in part on support from third-party software developers.the company believes decisions by customers to purchase its hardware products depend in part on the availability of third-party software
applications and services. there is no assurance that third-party developers will continue to develop and maintain software applications and services for the companys products. if third-party software applications and services cease to be
developed and maintained for the companys products, customers may choose not to buy the companys products.13



with respect to its mac products, the company believes the availability of third-party
software applications and services depends in part on the developers perception and analysis of the relative benefits of developing, maintaining, and upgrading such software for the companys products compared to windows-based products.
this analysis may be based on factors such as the market position of the company and its products, the anticipated revenue that may be generated, continued growth of mac sales, and the costs of developing such applications and services. if the
companys minority share of the global personal computer market causes developers to question the companys prospects, developers could be less inclined to develop or upgrade software for the companys products and more inclined to
devote their resources to developing and upgrading software for the larger windows market.with respect to ios devices, the
company relies on the continued availability and development of compelling and innovative software applications, which are distributed through a single distribution channel, the app store. the absence of multiple distribution channels, which are
available for competing platforms, may limit the availability and acceptance of third-party applications by the companys customers, thereby causing developers to reduce or curtail development for the ios platform. in addition, ios devices are
subject to rapid technological change, and, if third-party developers are unable to or choose not to keep up with this pace of change, third-party applications might not successfully operate and may result in dissatisfied customers. as with
applications for the companys mac products, the availability and development of these applications also depend on developers perceptions and analysis of the relative benefits of developing software for the companys products rather
than its competitors platforms, such as android. if developers focus their efforts on these competing platforms, the availability and quality of applications for the companys ios devices may suffer.the company depends on the performance of distributors, carriers and other resellers.the company distributes its products through cellular network carriers, wholesalers, national and regional retailers, and value-added
resellers, many of whom distribute products from competing manufacturers. the company also sells its products and third-party products in most of its major markets directly to education, enterprise and government customers, and consumers and small
and mid-sized businesses through its online and retail stores.carriers providing cellular network service for iphone
typically subsidize users purchase of the device. there is no assurance that such subsidies will be continued at all or in the same amounts upon renewal of the companys agreements with these carriers or in agreements the company enters
into with new carriers.many resellers have narrow operating margins and have been adversely affected in the past by weak
economic conditions. some resellers have perceived the expansion of the companys direct sales as conflicting with their business interests as distributors and resellers of the companys products. such a perception could discourage
resellers from investing resources in the distribution and sale of the companys products or lead them to limit or cease distribution of those products. the company has invested and will continue to invest in programs to enhance reseller sales,
including staffing selected resellers stores with company employees and contractors and improving product placement displays. these programs could require a substantial investment while providing no assurance of return or incremental revenue.
the financial condition of these resellers could weaken, these resellers could stop distributing the companys products, or uncertainty regarding demand for the companys products could cause resellers to reduce their ordering and
marketing of the companys products.the companys retail segment has required and will continue to require a
substantial investment and commitment of resources and is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties.the companys
retail stores have required substantial fixed investment in equipment and leasehold improvements, information systems, inventory and personnel. the company also has entered into substantial operating lease commitments for retail space. certain
stores have been designed and built to serve as high-profile venues to promote brand awareness and serve as vehicles for corporate sales and marketing activities. because of their unique design elements, locations and size, these stores require
substantially more investment than the14



companys more typical retail stores. due to the high fixed cost structure associated with the retail segment, a decline in sales or the closure or poor performance of individual or multiple
stores could result in significant lease termination costs, write-offs of equipment and leasehold improvements, and severance costs.many factors unique to retail operations, some of which are beyond the companys control, pose risks and uncertainties. these risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, macro-economic
factors that could have an adverse effect on general retail activity, as well as the companys inability to manage costs associated with store construction and operation, failure to manage relationships with its existing retail channel
partners, more challenging environments in managing retail operations outside the u.s., costs associated with unanticipated fluctuations in the value of retail inventory, and inability to obtain and renew leases in quality retail locations at a
reasonable cost.investment in new business strategies and acquisitions could disrupt the companys ongoing business
and present risks not originally contemplated.the company has invested, and in the future may invest, in new business
strategies or acquisitions. such endeavors may involve significant risks and uncertainties, including distraction of management from current operations, greater than expected liabilities and expenses, inadequate return of capital, and unidentified
issues not discovered in the companys due diligence. these new ventures are inherently risky and may not be successful.the companys products and services may experience quality problems from time to time that can result in decreased sales and
operating margin.the company sells complex hardware and software products and services that can contain design and
manufacturing defects. sophisticated operating system software and applications, such as those sold by the company, often contain bugs that can unexpectedly interfere with the softwares intended operation. the companys online
services may from time to time experience outages, service slowdowns, or errors. defects may also occur in components and products the company purchases from third parties. there can be no assurance the company will be able to detect and fix all
defects in the hardware, software and services it sells. failure to do so could result in lost revenue, significant warranty and other expenses, and harm to the companys reputation.the company is subject to laws and regulations worldwide, changes to which could increase the companys costs and individually or
in the aggregate adversely affect the companys business.the company is subject to laws and regulations affecting
its domestic and international operations in a number of areas. these u.s. and foreign laws and regulations affect the companys activities including, but not limited to, areas of labor, advertising, digital content, consumer protection,
real estate, billing, e-commerce, promotions, quality of services, telecommunications, mobile communications and media, television, intellectual property ownership and infringement, tax, import and export requirements, anti-corruption, foreign
exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions, data privacy requirements, anti-competition, environmental, health, and safety.by way of example, laws and regulations related to mobile communications and media devices in the many jurisdictions in which the company operates are extensive and subject to change. such changes could
include, among others, restrictions on the production, manufacture, distribution, and use of the device, locking the device to a carriers network, or mandating the use of the device on more than one carriers network. these devices are
also subject to certification and regulation by governmental and standardization bodies, as well as by cellular network carriers for use on their networks. these certification processes are extensive and time consuming, and could result in
additional testing requirements, product modifications, delays in product shipment dates, or preclude the company from selling certain products.compliance with these laws, regulations and similar requirements may be onerous and expensive, and they may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, further increasing the cost of
compliance. this increases the costs of doing business, and any such costs, which may rise in the future as a result of changes in these laws and15



regulations or in their interpretation could individually or in the aggregate make the companys products and services less attractive to the companys customers, delay the introduction
of new products in one or more regions, or cause the company to change or limit its business practices. the company has implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these laws and regulations, but there can be no assurance
that the companys employees, contractors, or agents will not violate such laws and regulations or the companys policies.the
companys success depends largely on the continued service and availability of key personnel.much of the
companys future success depends on the continued availability and service of key personnel, including its chief executive officer, executive team and other highly skilled employees. experienced personnel in the technology industry are in high
demand and competition for their talents is intense, especially in the silicon valley, where most of the companys key personnel are located.the companys business may be impacted by political events, war, terrorism, public health issues, natural disasters and other circumstances.war, terrorism, geopolitical uncertainties, public health issues, and other business interruptions have caused and could cause damage or
disruption to international commerce and the global economy, and thus could have a material adverse effect on the company, its suppliers, logistics providers, manufacturing vendors and customers, including channel partners. the companys
business operations are subject to interruption by natural disasters, fire, power shortages, nuclear power plant accidents, terrorist attacks, and other hostile acts, labor disputes, public health issues, and other events beyond its control. such
events could decrease demand for the companys products, make it difficult or impossible for the company to make and deliver products to its customers, including channel partners, or to receive components from its suppliers, and create delays
and inefficiencies in the companys supply chain. should major public health issues, including pandemics, arise, the company could be adversely affected by more stringent employee travel restrictions, additional limitations in freight services,
governmental actions limiting the movement of products between regions, delays in production ramps of new products, and disruptions in the operations of the companys manufacturing vendors and component suppliers. the majority of the
companys research and development activities, its corporate headquarters, information technology systems, and other critical business operations, including certain component suppliers and manufacturing vendors, are in locations that could be
affected by natural disasters. in the event of a natural disaster, the company could incur significant losses, require substantial recovery time and experience significant expenditures in order to resume operations.the companys business and reputation may be impacted by information technology system failures or network disruptions.the company may be subject to information technology system failures and network disruptions. these may be caused by
natural disasters, accidents, power disruptions, telecommunications failures, acts of terrorism or war, computer viruses, physical or electronic break-ins, or similar events or disruptions. system redundancy may be ineffective or inadequate, and the
companys disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities. such failures or disruptions could prevent access to the companys online stores and services, preclude retail store transactions, compromise company or
customer data, and result in delayed or cancelled orders. system failures and disruptions could also impede the manufacturing and shipping of products, delivery of online services, transactions processing and financial reporting.the company may be subject to breaches of its information technology systems, which could damage business partner and customer
relationships, curtail or otherwise adversely impact access to online stores and services, and could subject the company to significant reputational, financial, legal, and operational consequences.the companys business requires it to use and store customer, employee, and business partner personally identifiable information
(pii). this may include names, addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, contact16



preferences, tax identification numbers, and payment account information. although malicious attacks to gain access to pii affect many companies across various industries, the company may be at a
relatively greater risk of being targeted because of its high profile and the amount of pii managed.the company requires
user names and passwords in order to access its information technology systems. the company also uses encryption and authentication technologies to secure the transmission and storage of data. these security measures may be compromised as a result
of third-party security breaches, employee error, malfeasance, faulty password management, or other irregularity, and result in persons obtaining unauthorized access to company data or accounts. third parties may attempt to fraudulently induce
employees or customers into disclosing user names, passwords or other sensitive information, which may in turn be used to access the companys information technology systems. to help protect customers and the company, the company monitors
accounts and systems for unusual activity and may freeze accounts under suspicious circumstances, which may result in the delay or loss of customer orders.the company devotes significant resources to network security, data encryption, and other security measures to protect its systems and data, but these security measures cannot provide absolute security.
the company may experience a breach of its systems and may be unable to protect sensitive data. moreover, if a computer security breach affects the companys systems or results in the unauthorized release of pii, the companys reputation
and brand could be materially damaged and use of the companys products and services could decrease. the company would also be exposed to a risk of loss or litigation and possible liability.the companys business is subject to a variety of u.s. and international laws, rules, policies and other obligations regarding
data protection.the company is subject to federal, state and international laws relating to the collection, use,
retention, security and transfer of pii. in many cases, these laws apply not only to third-party transactions, but also to transfers of information between the company and its subsidiaries, and among the company, its subsidiaries and other parties
with which the company has commercial relations. several jurisdictions have passed new laws in this area, and other jurisdictions are considering imposing additional restrictions. these laws continue to develop and may be inconsistent from
jurisdiction to jurisdiction. complying with emerging and changing international requirements may cause the company to incur substantial costs or require the company to change its business practices. noncompliance could result in penalties or
significant legal liability.the companys privacy policy and related practices concerning the use and disclosure of
data are posted on its website. any failure by the company, its suppliers or other parties with whom the company does business to comply with its posted privacy policy or with other federal, state or international privacy-related or data protection
laws and regulations could result in proceedings against the company by governmental entities or others.the company is also
subject to payment card association rules and obligations under its contracts with payment card processors. under these rules and obligations, if information is compromised, the company could be liable to payment card issuers for the cost of
associated expenses and penalties. in addition, if the company fails to follow payment card industry security standards, even if no customer information is compromised, the company could incur significant fines or experience a significant increase
in payment card transaction costs.the company expects its quarterly revenue and operating results to fluctuate.the companys profit margins vary among its products and its distribution channels. the companys software,
accessories, and service and support contracts generally have higher gross margins than certain of the companys other products. gross margins on the companys hardware products vary across product lines and can change over time as a
result of product transitions, pricing and configuration changes, and component, warranty, and other cost fluctuations. the companys direct sales generally have higher associated gross margins than its17



indirect sales through its channel partners. in addition, the companys gross margin and operating margin percentages, as well as overall profitability, may be materially adversely impacted
as a result of a shift in product, geographic or channel mix, new products, component cost increases, strengthening u.s. dollar, or price competition. the company has typically experienced higher net sales in the first fiscal quarter compared to
other fiscal quarters due in part to holiday seasonal demand. actual and anticipated timing of new product introductions by the company can also significantly impact the level of net sales experienced by the company in any particular quarter. the
company could be subject to unexpected developments late in a quarter, such as lower-than-anticipated demand for the companys products, issues with new product introductions, an internal systems failure, or failure of one of the companys
logistics, components supply, or manufacturing partners.the companys stock price is subject to volatility.the companys stock continues to experience substantial price volatility. additionally, the company, the technology
industry, and the stock market as a whole have experienced extreme stock price and volume fluctuations that have affected stock prices in ways that may have been unrelated to these companies operating performance. the company believes its
stock price reflects high future growth and profitability expectations. if the company fails to meet these expectations its stock price may significantly decline, which could have a material adverse impact on investor confidence and employee
retention.the companys business is subject to the risks of international operations.the company derives a significant portion of its revenue and earnings from its international operations. compliance with applicable u.s.
and foreign laws and regulations, such as import and export requirements, anti-corruption laws, tax laws, foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions, data privacy requirements, environmental laws, labor laws, and anti-competition
regulations, increases the costs of doing business in foreign jurisdictions. although the company has implemented policies and procedures to comply with these laws and regulations, a violation by the companys employees, contractors, or agents
could nevertheless occur.the company also could be significantly affected by other risks associated with international
activities including, but not limited to, economic and labor conditions, increased duties, taxes and other costs, political instability, and changes in the value of the u.s. dollar versus local currencies. margins on sales of the companys
products in foreign countries, and on sales of products that include components obtained from foreign suppliers, could be materially adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and by international trade regulations, including
duties, tariffs and antidumping penalties. the company is also exposed to credit and collectability risk on its trade receivables with customers in certain international markets. there can be no assurance the company can effectively limit its credit
risk and avoid losses.the companys primary exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates relates to
non-u.s. dollar denominated sales and operating expenses worldwide. for example, the uncertainty regarding the ability of certain european countries to continue to service their sovereign debt obligations and the related financial restructuring
efforts by european governments may cause the value of several european currencies, including the euro, to fluctuate, which could adversely affect the companys non-u.s. dollar sales and operating expenses in the impacted jurisdictions.
weakening of foreign currencies relative to the u.s. dollar adversely affects the u.s. dollar value of the companys foreign currency-denominated sales and earnings, and generally leads the company to raise international pricing, potentially
reducing demand for the companys products. in some circumstances, for competitive or other reasons, the company may decide not to raise local prices to fully offset the dollars strengthening, or at all, which would adversely affect the
u.s. dollar value of the companys foreign currency denominated sales and earnings. conversely, a strengthening of foreign currencies relative to the u.s. dollar, while generally beneficial to the companys foreign currency-denominated
sales and earnings, could cause the company to reduce international pricing and incur losses on its foreign currency derivative instruments, thereby limiting the benefit. additionally, strengthening of foreign currencies may also increase the
companys cost of product components denominated in those currencies, thus adversely affecting gross margins.18



the company uses derivative instruments, such as foreign currency forward and option
contracts, to hedge certain exposures to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. the use of such hedging activities may not offset any or more than a portion of the adverse financial effects of unfavorable movements in foreign exchange
rates over the limited time the hedges are in place.the company is exposed to credit risk and fluctuations in the market
values of its investment portfolio.the company has not recognized any significant losses on its cash, cash equivalents
and marketable securities, but could experience significant declines in the market value of its investment portfolio. given the global nature of its business, the company has both domestic and international investments. credit ratings and pricing of
these investments can be negatively affected by liquidity, credit deterioration, financial results, economic risk, political risk, sovereign risk or other factors. as a result, the value and liquidity of the companys cash, cash equivalents and
marketable securities could decline and result in a significant impairment.the company is exposed to credit risk on its
trade accounts receivable, vendor non-trade receivables and prepayments related to long-term supply agreements, and this risk is heightened during periods when economic conditions worsen.the company distributes its products through third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers and value-added resellers. a
substantial majority of the companys outstanding trade receivables are not covered by collateral or credit insurance. the companys exposure to credit and collectability risk on its trade receivables is higher in certain international
markets and its ability to mitigate such risks may be limited. the company also has unsecured vendor non-trade receivables resulting from purchases of components by outsourcing partners and other vendors that manufacture sub-assemblies or assemble
final products for the company. in addition, the company has made prepayments associated with long-term supply agreements to secure supply of inventory components. as of september 29, 2012, a significant portion of the companys trade
receivables were concentrated within cellular network carriers, and its non-trade receivables and long-term supply agreements were concentrated among a few individual vendors located primarily in asia. while the company has procedures to monitor and
limit exposure to credit risk on its trade and vendor non-trade receivables as well as long-term prepayments, there can be no assurance such procedures will effectively limit its credit risk and avoid losses.the company could be impacted by unfavorable results of legal proceedings.the company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that have not yet been fully resolved and that have arisen in the ordinary
course of business, and additional claims may arise in the future. results of legal proceedings are subject to significant uncertainty and, regardless of the merit of the claims, litigation may be expensive, time-consuming, disruptive to the
companys operations, and distracting to management. in recognition of these considerations, the company may enter into arrangements to settle litigation.although management considers the likelihood of such an outcome to be remote, if one or more of these legal matters were resolved against the company in a reporting period for amounts in excess of
managements expectations, the companys consolidated financial statements for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected. further, such an outcome could result in significant compensatory, punitive or trebled monetary
damages, disgorgement of revenue or profits, remedial corporate measures or injunctive relief against the company that could materially adversely affect its financial condition and operating results.the company could be subject to changes in its tax rates, the adoption of new u.s. or international tax legislation or exposure to
additional tax liabilities.the company is subject to taxes in the u.s. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. current
economic and political conditions make tax rates in any jurisdiction, including the u.s., subject to significant change. the companys future effective tax rates could be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing

the markets where it competes, these markets are highly competitive and subject to aggressive pricing. to remain competitive, the company believes that continual investment in research and
development and marketing and advertising is critical to the development and sale of innovative products and technologies. the companys research and development spending is focused on investing in new hardware and software products, and in
further developing its existing products, including iphone, ipad, mac, and ipod hardware; ios and os x operating systems; and a variety of application software and online services.the company uses a variety of direct and indirect distribution channels, such as its retail stores, online stores, and direct sales
force, and third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers, and value-added resellers. the company believes that sales of its innovative and differentiated products are enhanced by knowledgeable salespersons who can convey the value of
the hardware and software integration, and demonstrate the unique solutions that are available on its products. the company further believes providing direct contact with its targeted customers is an effective way to demonstrate the advantages of
its products over those of its competitors and providing a high-quality sales and after-sales support experience is critical to attracting new and retaining existing customers. to ensure a high-quality buying experience for its products in which
service and education are emphasized, the company continues to expand and improve its distribution capabilities by expanding the number of its own retail stores worldwide. additionally, the company has invested in programs to enhance reseller sales
by placing high quality apple fixtures, merchandising materials and other resources within selected third-party reseller locations. through the apple premium reseller program, certain third-party resellers focus on the apple platform by providing a
high level of integration and support services, and product expertise.critical accounting policies and estimatesthe preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles
(gaap) and the companys discussion and analysis of its financial condition and operating results require the companys management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported in its
consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. note 1, summary of significant accounting policies of the notes to consolidated financial statements in part ii, item 8 of this form 10-k describes the significant accounting
policies and methods used in the preparation of the companys consolidated financial statements. management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the
results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. actual results may differ from these estimates and such differences may be material.management believes the companys critical accounting policies and estimates are those related to revenue recognition, valuation and
impairment of marketable securities, inventory valuation and inventory purchase commitments, warranty costs, income taxes, and legal and other contingencies. management considers these policies critical because they are both important to the
portrayal of the companys financial condition and operating results, and they require management to make judgments and estimates about inherently uncertain matters. the companys senior management has reviewed these critical accounting
policies and related disclosures with the audit and finance committee of the companys board of directors.revenue recognitionnet sales consist primarily of revenue from the sale of hardware, software, digital content and applications, peripherals,
and service and support contracts. the company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the sales price is fixed or determinable, and collection is probable. product is considered delivered to the
customer once it has been shipped and title and risk of loss have been transferred. for most of the companys product sales, these criteria are met at the time the product is shipped. for online sales to individuals, for some sales to education
customers in the u.s., and for certain other sales, the company defers revenue until the customer receives the product because the company retains a portion of the risk of loss on these sales during transit. the company recognizes revenue from the
sale of hardware products,26



software bundled with hardware that is essential to the functionality of the hardware, and third-party digital content sold on the itunes store in accordance with general revenue recognition
accounting guidance. the company recognizes revenue in accordance with industry specific software accounting guidance for the following types of sales transactions: (i) standalone sales of software products, (ii) sales of software upgrades
and (iii) sales of software bundled with hardware not essential to the functionality of the hardware.for multi-element
arrangements that include hardware products containing software essential to the hardware products functionality, undelivered software elements that relate to the hardware products essential software, and/or undelivered non-software
services, the company allocates revenue to all deliverables based on their relative selling prices. in such circumstances, the company uses a hierarchy to determine the selling price to be used for allocating revenue to deliverables:
(i) vendor-specific objective evidence of fair value (vsoe), (ii) third-party evidence of selling price (tpe) and (iii) best estimate of selling price (esp). vsoe generally exists only when the
company sells the deliverable separately and is the price actually charged by the company for that deliverable. esps reflect the companys best estimates of what the selling prices of elements would be if they were sold regularly on a
stand-alone basis.for sales of qualifying versions of ios devices, mac and apple tv, the company has indicated it may from
time to time provide future unspecified software upgrades and features free of charge to customers. the company also provides various non-software services to owners of qualifying versions of ios devices and mac. because the company has neither vsoe
nor tpe for the unspecified software upgrade rights or the non-software services, revenue is allocated to these rights and services based on the companys esps. revenue allocated to the unspecified software upgrade rights and non-software
services based on the companys esps is deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis over the estimated period the software upgrades and non-software services are expected to be provided for each of these devices, which ranges from two to
four years.the companys process for determining esps involves managements judgment and considers multiple
factors that may vary over time depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each deliverable. if the facts and circumstances underlying the factors considered change, including the estimated or actual costs incurred to provide
non-software services or the estimated period the software upgrades and non-software services are expected to be provided, or should future facts and circumstances lead the company to consider additional factors, the companys esps and the
future rate of related amortization for software upgrades and non-software services related to future sales of these devices could change.the company records reductions to revenue for estimated commitments related to price protection and other customer incentive programs. for transactions involving price protection, the company recognizes
revenue net of the estimated amount to be refunded, provided the refund amount can be reasonably and reliably estimated and the other conditions for revenue recognition have been met. the companys policy requires that, if refunds cannot be
reliably estimated, revenue is not recognized until reliable estimates can be made or the price protection lapses. for the companys other customer incentive programs, the estimated cost is recognized at the later of the date at which the
company has sold the product or the date at which the program is offered. the company also records reductions to revenue for expected future product returns based on the companys historical experience. future market conditions and product
transitions may require the company to increase customer incentive programs that could result in reductions to future revenue. additionally, certain customer incentive programs require management to estimate the number of customers who will actually
redeem the incentive. managements estimates are based on historical experience and the specific terms and conditions of particular incentive programs. if a greater than estimated proportion of customers redeems such incentives, the company
would be required to record additional reductions to revenue, which would have an adverse impact on the companys results of operations.valuation and impairment of marketable securitiesthe companys investments in available-for-sale securities are reported at fair value. unrealized gains and losses related to changes in the fair value of securities are recognized in accumulated
other comprehensive income, net27



of tax, in the companys consolidated balance sheets. changes in the fair value of available-for-sale securities impact the companys net income only when such securities are sold or an
other-than-temporary impairment is recognized. realized gains and losses on the sale of securities are determined by specific identification of each securitys cost basis. the company regularly reviews its investment portfolio to determine if
any security is other-than-temporarily impaired, which would require the company to record an impairment charge in the period any such determination is made. in making this judgment, the company evaluates, among other things, the duration and extent
to which the fair value of a security is less than its cost; the financial condition of the issuer and any changes thereto; and the companys intent to sell, or whether it will more likely than not be required to sell, the security before
recovery of the its amortized cost basis. the companys assessment on whether a security is other-than-temporarily impaired could change in the future due to new developments or changes in assumptions related to any particular security.inventory valuation and inventory purchase commitmentsthe company must order components for its products and build inventory in advance of product shipments. the company records a write-down for inventories of components and products, including third-party
products held for resale, which have become obsolete or are in excess of anticipated demand or net realizable value. the company performs a detailed review of inventory each fiscal quarter that considers multiple factors including demand forecasts,
product life cycle status, product development plans, current sales levels, and component cost trends. the industries in which the company competes are subject to a rapid and unpredictable pace of product and component obsolescence and demand
changes. if future demand or market conditions for the companys products are less favorable than forecasted or if unforeseen technological changes negatively impact the utility of component inventory, the company may be required to record
additional write-downs, which would adversely affect its results of operations in the period when the write-downs were recorded.the company records accruals for estimated cancellation fees related to component orders that have been cancelled or are expected to be cancelled. consistent with industry practice, the company acquires
components through a combination of purchase orders, supplier contracts, and open orders based on projected demand information. these commitments typically cover the companys requirements for periods up to 150 days. if there is an abrupt and
substantial decline in demand for one or more of the companys products or an unanticipated change in technological requirements for any of the companys products, the company may be required to record additional accruals for cancellation
fees that would adversely affect its results of operations in the period when the cancellation fees are identified and recorded.warranty
coststhe company provides for the estimated cost of hardware and software warranties at the time the related revenue is
recognized based on historical and projected warranty claim rates, historical and projected cost-per-claim, and knowledge of specific product failures that are outside of the companys typical experience. each quarter, the company reevaluates
its estimates to assess the adequacy of its recorded warranty liabilities considering the size of the installed base of products subject to warranty protection and adjusts the amounts as necessary. if actual product failure rates or repair costs
differ from estimates, revisions to the estimated warranty liabilities would be required and could materially affect the companys results of operations.income taxesthe company records a tax provision for the anticipated tax
consequences of the reported results of operations. the provision for income taxes is computed using the asset and liability method, under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary
differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to taxable
income in effect for the years in which those tax assets are expected to be realized or settled. the company records a28



valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is believed more likely than not to be realized.the company recognizes tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical
merits of the position. the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement.management believes it is more likely than not that forecasted income, including income that may be generated as a result of certain tax
planning strategies, together with future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, will be sufficient to fully recover the deferred tax assets. in the event that the company determines all or part of the net deferred tax assets are not
realizable in the future, the company will make an adjustment to the valuation allowance that would be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made. in addition, the calculation of tax liabilities involves significant judgment in
estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of gaap and complex tax laws. resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with managements expectations could have a material impact on the companys financial
condition and operating results.legal and other contingenciesas discussed in part i, item 3 of this form 10-k under the heading legal proceedings and in part ii, item 8 of this
form 10-k in the notes to consolidated financial statements in note 7, commitments and contingencies, the company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims, including those that arise in the ordinary course of business. the
company records a liability when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable. there is significant judgment required in both the probability determination and as to whether an exposure can be reasonably
estimated. in the opinion of management, there was not at least a reasonable possibility the company may have incurred a material loss, or a material loss in excess of a recorded accrual, with respect to loss contingencies for legal and other
contingencies. however, the outcome of legal proceedings and claims brought against the company is subject to significant uncertainty. therefore, although management considers the likelihood of such an outcome to be remote, if one or more of these
legal matters were resolved against the company in a reporting period for amounts in excess of managements expectations, the companys consolidated financial statements for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected.fiscal periodthe companys fiscal year is the 52 or 53-week period that ends on the last saturday of september. the companys fiscal years 2012, 2011 and 2010 ended on september 29,
2012, september 24, 2011, and september 25, 2010, respectively. fiscal year 2012 spanned 53 weeks, with a 14th week included in the first quarter of 2012, as is done approximately every six years to realign the companys
fiscal quarters more closely to calendar quarters. inclusion of the additional week in 2012 increased the companys overall net sales and operating expenses for the year. fiscal years 2011 and 2010 spanned 52
weeks each. unless otherwise stated, references to particular years or quarters refer to the companys fiscal years ended in september and the associated quarters of those fiscal years.29

fiscal year 2012 versus 2011net sales during 2012 increased $48.3 billion or 45% compared to 2011. several factors contributed positively to this
increase, including the addition of a 14th week in the
first quarter of 2012, as well as the following:net sales of iphone and related products and services were $80.5 billion in 2012, representing an increase of $33.4 billion or 71% compared to 2011.
iphone unit sales totaled 125.0 million during 2012, representing an increase of 52.8 million units or 73% compared to 2011. the year-over-year growth in iphone net sales and unit sales during 2012 reflects strong demand for iphone in all
of the companys operating segments, which is primarily a result of the launches of iphone 4s in the first quarter of 2012 and iphone 5 in the fourth quarter of 2012, ongoing demand for iphone 4 and iphone 3gs, and expanded distribution with
new carriers and resellers. net sales of iphone and related products and services were 51% and 43% of the companys total net sales for 2012 and 2011, respectively.net sales of ipad and related products and services were $32.4 billion in 2012, representing an increase of $12.1 billion or 59% compared to 2011.
unit sales of ipad were 58.3 million during 2012, an increase of 80% from 2011. the year-over-year increase in ipad net sales and unit sales during 2012 was driven by strong demand for ipad in all of the companys operating segments as a
result of the launch of the new ipad in march 2012, continued demand for ipad 2, and expanded distribution with new resellers. the year-over-year growth rate of ipad unit sales was higher than the growth rate of ipad net sales during 2012 due to a
reduction of average selling prices as a result of a shift in product mix toward lower-priced ipad models, the price reduction for ipad 2 and an increase in indirect sales due to expanded distribution through third-party resellers. net sales of ipad
and related products and services were 21% and 19% of the companys total net sales for 2012 and 2011, respectively.mac net sales were $23.2 billion in 2012, representing an increase of $1.4 billion or 7% compared to 2011. mac unit sales totaled 18.2 million
during 2012, representing an increase of 1.4 million or 9% compared to 2011. the year-over-year growth in mac net sales and unit sales during 2012 reflects increased demand for mac portables in all of the companys operating segments
driven by 2012 releases of updated models of macbook air and macbook pro, including the new macbook pro with retina display in june 2012. partially offsetting the increase in net sales of mac portables was a decline in net sales of mac desktops that
reflected the overall decline in the market for desktop personal computers during 2012. additionally, the company did not introduce updated versions of its mac desktop products in 2012. mac net sales were 15% and 20% of the companys total net
sales for 2012 and 2011, respectively.net sales of other music related products and services were $8.5 billion in 2012, representing an increase of $2.2 billion or 35% compared to 2011.
the increase was due primarily to growth of the itunes store, which generated total net sales of $7.5 billion for 2012 compared to net sales of $5.4 billion during 2011. the strong results of the itunes store reflect growth of the app store;
growth of the companys customer base; and the continued expansion of third-party audio, video and book content available for sale or rent via the itunes store. the company continues to expand its itunes content and applications offerings
around the world. net sales of other music related products and services were 5% and 6% of the companys total net sales for 2012 and 2011, respectively.partially offsetting the positive factors contributing to the overall increase in net sales was a decrease in ipod net sales experienced
across all operating segments. ipod net sales were $5.6 billion in 2012, a decrease of $1.8 billion or 25% compared to 2011. similarly, ipod unit sales decreased by 17% in 2012 compared to 2011. declines in net sales and unit sales of ipod
reflect the continuing contraction of the overall market for mp3 players. net sales of ipod were 4% and 7% of the companys total net sales for 2012 and 2011, respectively.the company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first fiscal quarter compared to other quarters in its fiscal year due
in part to holiday seasonal demand. actual and anticipated timing of new product introductions31



by the company can also significantly impact the level of net sales experienced by the company in any particular quarter. however, neither historical seasonal patterns nor historical patterns of
product introductions should be considered reliable indicators of the companys future net sales or financial performance.growth in total net sales was particularly strong during the first six months of 2012, rising $34.1 billion or 66% compared to the same period in 2011. the net sales growth during the first six months of
2012 reflects the launch of iphone 4s in the first quarter of 2012 and the companys ability to meet demand more quickly for iphone 4s when compared to the iphone 4 launch. growth during the first half of 2012 was also favorably impacted by the
addition of a 14th week in the first quarter of 2012 and
strong unit sales of ipad during the holiday season, resulting in a 111% increase in ipad unit sales during the first quarter of 2012 compared to the same quarter in 2011.fiscal year 2011 versus 2010net sales during 2011 increased $43.0
billion or 66% compared to 2010. several factors contributed positively to this increase, including the following:net sales of iphone and related products and services were $47.1 billion in 2011, representing an increase of $21.9 billion or 87% compared to 2010.
iphone unit sales totaled 72.3 million during 2011, representing an increase of 32.3 million units or 81% compared to 2010. iphone year-over-year net sales growth reflected strong demand for iphone 4 in all of the companys operating
segments. the expanded u.s. distribution of iphone to the verizon wireless network beginning in february 2011, continued expansion into new countries, and increased distribution with other new carriers and resellers also contributed to the
year-over-year growth of iphone. net sales of iphone and related products and services accounted for 43% and 39% of the companys total net sales for 2011 and 2010, respectively.net sales of ipad and related products and services, which the company introduced in the third quarter of 2010, were $20.4 billion in 2011,
representing an increase of $15.4 billion or 311% compared to 2010. unit sales of ipad were 32.4 million during 2011, an increase of 334% from 2010. the year-over-year unit growth and net sales growth were driven by strong ipad demand in all of
the companys operating segments. net sales of ipad and related products and services accounted for 19% and 8% of the companys total net sales for 2011 and 2010, respectively.mac net sales were $21.8 billion in 2011, representing an increase of $4.3 billion or 25% compared to 2010. mac unit sales increased by
3.1 million or 22% in 2011 compared to 2010. the year-over-year growth in mac net sales and unit sales was due primarily to higher demand in all of the companys operating segments for macbook air and macbook pro, which were updated in
july 2011 and february 2011, respectively. the year-over-year revenue growth for portables and desktops was 36% and 4%, respectively. mac net sales accounted for 20% and 27% of the companys total net sales for 2011 and 2010, respectively.net sales of other music related products and services were $6.3 billion in 2011, representing an increase of $1.4 billion or 28% compared to 2010.
the increase was due primarily to increased net sales from the itunes store, which was largely driven by app store expansion into new countries that contributed to strong growth in all of the companys geographic segments. during 2011, net
sales for the itunes store, app store and ibookstore was $5.4 billion, representing an increase of 33% compared to 2010. the company believes this continued growth was the result of heightened consumer interest in downloading third-party digital
content, continued growth in its customer base of ios devices, expansion of third-party audio and video content available via the itunes store, and continued interest in and growth of the app store. net sales of other music related products and
services accounted for 6% and 8% of the companys total net sales for 2011 and 2010, respectively.partially offsetting the positive factors contributing to the overall increase in net sales was a decrease in ipod net sales of $821
million or 10% during 2011 compared to 2010. similarly, ipod unit sales decreased by 15% in 2011 compared to 2010. however, net sales per ipod unit sold increased during 2011 compared to 2010 due primarily32



to a shift in ipod product mix toward ipod touch. net sales of ipod accounted for 7% and 13% of the companys total net sales for 2011 and 2010, respectively.segment operating performancethe company manages its business primarily on a geographic basis. the companys reportable operating segments consist of the americas, europe, japan, asia-pacific and retail operations. the results
of the americas, europe, japan and asia-pacific segments do not include results of the retail segment. the americas segment includes both north and south america. the europe segment includes european countries, as well as the middle east and africa.
the asia-pacific segment includes australia and asian countries, other than japan. the retail segment operates apple retail stores in 13 countries, including the u.s. each operating segment provides similar hardware and software products and similar
services. further information regarding the companys operating segments may be found in part ii, item 8 of this form 10-k in the notes to consolidated financial statements in note 8, segment information and geographic data.americasnet sales in the americas segment increased $19.2 billion or 50% during 2012 compared to 2011. the growth in net sales during 2012 was
primarily driven by increased demand for iphone following the launches of iphone 4s and iphone 5, strong demand for the new ipad and ipad 2, and higher sales from the itunes store. the americas segment represented approximately 37% and 35% of the
companys total net sales for 2012 and 2011, respectively.net sales in the americas segment increased $13.8 billion or
56% during 2011 compared to 2010. the primary contributors to the growth in net sales was a significant year-over-year increase in iphone sales from carrier expansion and strong demand for iphone 4 and increased sales of ipad and mac, partially
offset by a decrease in ipod sales. higher sales of third-party digital content and applications from the itunes store also drove an increase in net sales during 2011. the americas segment represented approximately 35% and 37% of the companys
total net sales for 2011 and 2010, respectively.europenet sales in the europe segment increased $8.5 billion or 31% during 2012 compared to 2011. the growth in net sales during 2012 was primarily driven by strong demand for the new ipad and ipad 2, higher
sales from the itunes store and increased demand for iphone from the launch of iphone 4s. iphone 5 was launched in a limited number of countries in the europe segment at the end of the fourth quarter of 2012 and did not contribute to the growth in
net sales in the europe segment to the extent it did in other segments. lower year-over-year growth in net sales in the europe segment during 2012 compared to the companys other geographic segments reflects growth in iphone unit sales that was
well below the growth rates experienced by the companys other operating segments, partially offset by strong growth in ipad unit sales. net sales in the europe segment were also negatively impacted by the regions uncertain economic
conditions and the strength in the u.s. dollar relative to several european currencies, including the euro. the europe segment represented approximately 23% and 26% of the companys total net sales for 2012 and 2011, respectively.net sales in the europe segment increased $9.1 billion or 49% during 2011 compared to 2010. the increase in net sales during 2011 was
attributable primarily to the continued year-over-year increase in iphone sales from carrier expansion and strong demand for iphone 4, and increased sales of ipad and mac, partially offset by a decrease in ipod sales. the europe segment represented
26% and 29% of the companys total net sales for 2011 and 2010, respectively.33



japannet sales in the japan segment increased $5.1 billion or 94% during 2012 compared to 2011. the growth in net sales during 2012 was primarily driven by increased demand for iphone following the launches of
iphone 4s and iphone 5, expanded distribution with a new iphone carrier, strong demand for the new ipad and ipad 2, higher sales from the itunes store, and strength in the japanese yen relative to the u.s. dollar. the japan segment represented
approximately 7% and 5% of the companys total net sales for 2012 and 2011, respectively.net sales in the japan segment
increased $1.5 billion or 37% during 2011 compared to 2010. the key contributors to japans net sales growth were increased iphone sales, strong sales of ipad, increased sales of mac, and strength in the japanese yen relative to the u.s.
dollar. the japan segment represented 5% and 6% of the companys total net sales for 2011 and 2010, respectively.asia-pacificnet sales in the asia-pacific segment increased $10.7 billion or 47% during 2012 compared to 2011. the growth in net sales
during 2012 was mainly due to increased demand for iphone from the launch of iphone 4s, strong demand for the new ipad and ipad 2, and higher mac sales. growth in the asia pacific segment was affected by the timing of iphone and ipad product
launches. iphone 5 was launched in a limited number of countries in the asia pacific segment during the fourth quarter of 2012 and was not launched in china during 2012, and the new ipad that was introduced by the company in march 2012 was not
launched in china until the fourth quarter of 2012. the asia-pacific segment represented approximately 21% of the companys total net sales in both 2012 and 2011.net sales in the asia pacific segment increased $14.3 billion or 174% during 2011 compared to 2010. the company experienced particularly strong year-over-year net sales growth in its asia pacific segment
during 2011, especially in greater china, which includes hong kong and taiwan. korea and australia also experienced strong year-over-year revenue growth. higher net sales in the asia pacific segment were due mainly to the increase in iphone sales
primarily attributable to the strong demand for iphone 4 and carrier expansion, strong sales of ipad, and increased mac sales. the asia pacific segment represented 21% and 13% of the companys total net sales in 2011 and 2010, respectively.retailnet
sales in the retail segment increased $4.7 billion or 33% during 2012 compared to 2011. the growth in net sales during 2012 was driven primarily by increased demand for iphone following the launches of iphone 4s and iphone 5, strong demand for the
new ipad and ipad 2, and higher mac net sales. lower year-over-year growth in net sales in the retail segment during 2012 compared to the companys other segments reflects the significant growth in ipad indirect distribution channel
expansion. the retail segment accounted for 12% and 13% of the companys total net sales for 2012 and 2011, respectively.the company opened 33 new retail stores during 2012, 28 of which were outside the u.s., ending the year with 390 stores open compared to 357 stores at the end of 2011. as of september 29, 2012, the
company had a total of 250 u.s. retail stores and 140 international retail stores. with an average of 365 stores and 326 stores during 2012 and 2011, respectively, average revenue per store increased 19% to $51.5 million in 2012 compared to $43.3
million in 2011.net sales in the retail segment increased $4.3 billion or 44% during 2011 compared to 2010. the increase in
net sales was driven primarily by strong demand for ipad, higher mac sales, and an increase in iphone sales. the company opened 40 new retail stores during 2011, 28 of which were outside the u.s., ending the year with 357 stores open compared
to 317 stores at the end of 2010. as of september 24, 2011, the company had a total of 245 u.s. retail stores and 112 international retail stores. during 2011, the company had an average of 326 stores compared to an average of 288 stores

$43.3 million in 2011 compared to $34.1 million in 2010. the retail segment represented 13% and 15% of the companys total net sales in 2011 and 2010, respectively.the retail segments operating income was $4.7 billion, $3.2 billion, and $2.3 billion during 2012, 2011, and 2010 respectively.
these year-over-year increases in retail operating income were primarily attributable to higher overall net sales that resulted in significantly higher average revenue per store during the respective years.gross margingross
margin for 2012, 2011 and 2010 are as follows (in millions, except gross margin percentages):net salescost of salesgross margingross margin percentagethe gross margin percentage in 2012 was 43.9%, compared to 40.5% in 2011. this year-over-year increase in
gross margin was largely driven by lower commodity and other product costs, a higher mix of iphone sales, and improved leverage on fixed costs from higher net sales. the increase in gross margin was partially offset by the impact of a stronger u.s.
dollar. the gross margin percentage during the first half of 2012 was 45.9% compared to 41.4% during the second half of 2012. the primary drivers of higher gross margin in the first half of 2012 compared to the second half are a higher mix of iphone
sales and improved leverage on fixed costs from higher net sales. additionally, gross margin in the second half of 2012 was also affected by the introduction of new products with flat pricing that have higher cost structures and deliver
greater value to customers, price reductions on certain existing products, higher transition costs associated with product launches, and continued strengthening of the u.s. dollar; partially offset by lower commodity costs.the gross margin percentage in 2011 was 40.5%, compared to 39.4% in 2010. this year-over-year increase in gross margin was largely driven
by lower commodity and other product costs.the company expects to experience decreases in its gross margin percentage in
future periods, as compared to levels achieved during 2012, and the company anticipates gross margin of about 36% during the first quarter of 2013. expected future declines in gross margin are largely due to a higher mix of new and innovative
products with flat or reduced pricing that have higher cost structures and deliver greater value to customers and anticipated component cost and other cost increases. future strengthening of the u.s. dollar could further negatively impact gross
margin.the foregoing statements regarding the companys expected gross margin percentage in future periods, including
the first quarter of 2013, are forward-looking and could differ from actual results because of several factors including, but not limited to those set forth above in part i, item 1a of this form 10-k under the heading risk factors
and those described in this paragraph. in general, gross margins and margins on individual products will remain under downward pressure due to a variety of factors, including continued industry wide global product pricing pressures, increased
competition, compressed product life cycles, product transitions and potential increases in the cost of components, as well as potential increases in the costs of outside manufacturing services and a potential shift in the companys sales mix
towards products with lower gross margins. in response to competitive pressures, the company expects it will continue to take product pricing actions, which would adversely affect gross margins. gross margins could also be affected by the
companys ability to manage product quality and warranty costs effectively and to stimulate demand for certain of its products. due to the companys significant international operations, financial results can be significantly affected in
the short-term by fluctuations in exchange rates.35

r&d expense was driven by an increase in headcount and related expenses to support expanded r&d activities. although total r&d expense increased 39% and 36% in 2012 and 2011, respectively, it remained fairly consistent as a percentage of
net sales.the company continues to believe that focused investments in r&d are critical to its future growth and
competitive position in the marketplace and are directly related to timely development of new and enhanced products that are central to the companys core business strategy. as such, the company expects to make further investments in r&d to
remain competitive.selling, general and administrative (sg&a) expensesg&a expense increased $2.4 billion or 32% during 2012 compared to 2011 and $2.1 billion or 38% during 2011 compared to 2010. these
increases were primarily due to the companys continued expansion of its retail segment, increased headcount and related expenses, higher spending on professional services, marketing and advertising programs, and increased variable costs
associated with the overall growth of the companys net sales.other income and expenseother income and expense for 2012, 2011, and 2010 are as follows (in millions):interest and dividend incomeother expense, nettotal other income/(expense), nettotal other income and expense increased $107 million or 26% to $522 million during 2012 compared to
$415 million and $155 million in 2011 and 2010, respectively. the year-over-year increase in other income and expense during 2012 was due primarily to higher interest and dividend income on the companys higher cash, cash equivalents and
marketable securities balances, partially offset by higher premium expenses on foreign exchange contracts. the overall increase in other income and expense in 2011 compared to 2010 was attributable to higher interest income and net realized gains on
sales of marketable securities. the weighted average interest rate earned by the company on its cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities was 1.03%, 0.77%, and 0.75% during 2012, 2011, and 2010, respectively. during 2012, 2011, and 2010, the
company had no debt outstanding and accordingly did not incur any related interest expense.provision for income taxesthe companys effective tax rates were approximately 25.2%, 24.2%, and 24.4% for 2012, 2011, and 2010, respectively. the
companys effective rates for these periods differ from the statutory federal income tax rate of36

35% due primarily to certain undistributed foreign earnings for which no u.s. taxes are provided because such earnings are intended to be indefinitely reinvested outside the u.s.as of september 29, 2012, the company had deferred tax assets arising from deductible temporary differences, tax losses, and tax
credits of $4.0 billion, and deferred tax liabilities of $14.9 billion. management believes it is more likely than not that forecasted income, including income that may be generated as a result of certain tax planning strategies, together with
future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, will be sufficient to fully recover the deferred tax assets. the company will continue to evaluate the realizability of deferred tax assets quarterly by assessing the need for and amount of
a valuation allowance.the internal revenue service (the irs) has completed its field audit of the companys
federal income tax returns for the years 2004 through 2006 and proposed certain adjustments. the company has contested certain of these adjustments through the irs appeals office. the irs is currently examining the years 2007 through 2009. all irs
audit issues for years prior to 2004 have been resolved. in addition, the company is subject to audits by state, local, and foreign tax authorities. management believes that adequate provisions have been made for any adjustments that may result
from tax examinations. however, the outcome of tax audits cannot be predicted with certainty. if any issues addressed in the companys tax audits are resolved in a manner not consistent with managements expectations, the company could be
required to adjust its provision for income taxes in the period such resolution occurs.liquidity and capital resourcesthe following table presents selected financial information and statistics as of and for the years ended september 29,

securities, an increase of $39.7 billion or 49% from september 24, 2011. the principal components of this net increase was the cash generated by operating activities of $50.9 billion, which was partially offset by payments for acquisition of
property, plant and equipment of $8.3 billion, payments for acquisition of intangible assets of $1.1 billion and payments of dividends and dividend equivalent rights of $2.5 billion.the companys marketable securities investment portfolio is invested primarily in highly-rated securities and its investment policy
generally limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. the policy requires investments generally to be investment grade with the objective of minimizing the potential risk of principal loss. as of september 29, 2012 and
september 24, 2011, $82.6 billion and $54.3 billion, respectively, of the companys cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities were held by foreign subsidiaries and are generally based in u.s. dollar-denominated holdings. amounts
held by foreign subsidiaries are generally subject to u.s. income taxation on repatriation to the u.s. the company believes its existing balances of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities will be sufficient to satisfy its working capital
needs, capital asset purchases, outstanding commitments, common stock repurchases, dividends on its common stock, and other liquidity requirements associated with its existing operations over the next 12 months.capital assetsthe
companys capital expenditures were $10.3 billion during 2012, consisting of $865 million for retail store facilities and $9.5 billion for other capital expenditures, including product tooling and manufacturing process37

for retail store facilities and approximately $9.15 billion for other capital expenditures, including product tooling and manufacturing process equipment, and corporate facilities and infrastructure, including information systems hardware, software
and enhancements.during 2013, the company expects to open about 30 to 35 new retail stores, with approximately
three-quarters located outside of the u.s.dividend and stock repurchase programin march 2012, the board of directors of the company approved a dividend policy pursuant to which it plans to pay, subject to subsequent
declaration, quarterly dividends of $2.65 per share. the company expects to pay approximately $2.5 billion each quarter in conjunction with the quarterly declared dividends.in march 2012, the companys board of directors authorized a program to repurchase up to $10 billion of the companys common stock beginning in 2013. the repurchase program is expected to be
executed over a three-year period with the primary objective of neutralizing the impact of dilution from future employee equity grants and employee stock purchase programs. the repurchase program does not obligate the company to acquire any specific
number of shares. the company anticipates that it will utilize approximately $45 billion of domestic cash to pay dividends, repurchase shares, and to remit withheld taxes related to net share settlement of restricted stock units in the first three
years of the dividend and stock repurchase programs. the company anticipates the cash used for future dividends and the repurchase program will come primarily from current domestic cash and from on-going u.s. operating activities and the cash
generated from such activities.off-balance sheet arrangements and contractual obligationsthe company has not entered into any transactions with unconsolidated entities whereby the company has financial guarantees, subordinated
retained interests, derivative instruments, or other contingent arrangements that expose the company to material continuing risks, contingent liabilities, or any other obligation under a variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides
financing, liquidity, market risk, or credit risk support to the company.the following table presents certain payments due
by the company under contractual obligations with minimum firm commitments as of september 29, 2012 and excludes amounts already recorded on the consolidated balance sheet (in millions):operating leasespurchase obligationsother obligationstotallease commitmentsthe companys major facility leases are typically for terms not exceeding 10 years and generally provide renewal options for terms not exceeding five additional years. leases for retail space are for
terms ranging from38



five to 20 years, the majority of which are for 10 years, and often contain multi-year renewal options. as of september 29, 2012, the companys total future minimum lease payments under
noncancelable operating leases were $4.4 billion, of which $3.1 billion related to leases for retail space.purchase commitments with
outsourcing partners and component suppliersthe company utilizes several outsourcing partners to manufacture
sub-assemblies for the companys products and to perform final assembly and testing of finished products. these outsourcing partners acquire components and build product based on demand information supplied by the company, which typically
covers periods up to 150 days. the company also obtains individual components for its products from a wide variety of individual suppliers. consistent with industry practice, the company acquires components through a combination of purchase orders,
supplier contracts, and open orders based on projected demand information. as of september 29, 2012, the company had outstanding off-balance sheet third-party manufacturing commitments and component purchase commitments of $21.1 billion.other obligationsin addition to the off-balance sheet commitments mentioned above, the company had outstanding obligations of $988 million as of september 29, 2012, that were comprised mainly of commitments to
acquire capital assets, including product tooling and manufacturing process equipment, and commitments related to advertising, research and development, internet and telecommunications services and other obligations.the companys other non-current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets consist primarily of deferred tax liabilities, gross
unrecognized tax benefits and the related gross interest and penalties. as of september 29, 2012, the company had non-current deferred tax liabilities of $13.8 billion. additionally, as of september 29, 2012, the company had gross
unrecognized tax benefits of $2.1 billion and an additional $401 million for gross interest and penalties classified as non-current liabilities. at this time, the company is unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments in
individual years in connection with these tax liabilities; therefore, such amounts are not included in the above contractual obligation table.indemnificationthe
company generally does not indemnify end-users of its operating system and application software against legal claims that the software infringes third-party intellectual property rights. other agreements entered into by the company sometimes include
indemnification provisions under which the company could be subject to costs and/or damages in the event of an infringement claim against the company or an indemnified third-party. however, the company has not been required to make any significant
payments resulting from such an infringement claim asserted against it or an indemnified third-party. in the opinion of management, there was not at least a reasonable possibility the company may have incurred a material loss with respect to
indemnification of end-users of its operating system or application software for infringement of third-party intellectual property rights. the company did not record a liability for infringement costs related to indemnification as of
september 29, 2012 or september 24, 2011.the company has entered into indemnification agreements with its
directors and executive officers. under these agreements, the company has agreed to indemnify such individuals to the fullest extent permitted by law against liabilities that arise by reason of their status as directors or officers and to advance
expenses incurred by such individuals in connection with related legal proceedings. it is not possible to determine the maximum potential amount of payments the company could be required to make under these agreements due to the limited history of
prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each claim. however, the company maintains directors and officers liability insurance coverage to reduce its exposure to such obligations, and payments made under these
agreements historically have not been material.39


## Item 7A


to provide a meaningful assessment of the foreign currency risk associated with certain of
the companys foreign currency derivative positions, the company performed a sensitivity analysis using a value-at-risk (var) model to assess the potential impact of fluctuations in exchange rates. the var model consisted of using a
monte carlo simulation to generate thousands of random market price paths assuming normal market conditions. the var is the maximum expected loss in fair value, for a given confidence interval, to the companys foreign currency derivative
positions due to adverse movements in rates. the var model is not intended to represent actual losses but is used as a risk estimation and management tool. the model assumes normal market conditions. forecasted transactions, firm commitments, and
assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies were excluded from the model. based on the results of the model, the company estimates with 95% confidence a maximum one-day loss in fair value of $200 million as of september 29, 2012
compared to a maximum one-day loss in fair value of $161 million as of september 24, 2011. because the company uses foreign currency instruments for hedging purposes, the loss in fair value incurred on those instruments are generally offset by
increases in the fair value of the underlying exposures.actual future gains and losses associated with the companys
investment portfolio and derivative positions may differ materially from the sensitivity analyses performed as of september 29, 2012 due to the inherent limitations associated with predicting the timing and amount of changes in interest rates,
foreign currency exchanges rates and the companys actual exposures and positions.41

notes to consolidated financial statementsnote 1  summary of significant accounting policiesapple inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries (collectively apple or the company) designs,
manufactures, and markets mobile communication and media devices, personal computers, and portable digital music players, and sells a variety of related software, services, peripherals, networking solutions, and third-party digital content and
applications. the company sells its products worldwide through its retail stores, online stores, and direct sales force, as well as through third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers and value-added resellers. in addition, the
company sells a variety of third-party iphone, ipad, mac, and ipod compatible products including application software, and various accessories through its online and retail stores. the company sells to consumers, small and mid-sized businesses, and
education, enterprise and government customers.basis of presentation and preparationthe accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the company. intercompany accounts and transactions have been
eliminated. the preparation of these consolidated financial statements in conformity with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles (gaap) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in
these consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. actual results could differ materially from those estimates. certain prior year amounts in the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto have been reclassified to conform to
the current years presentation. prior period costs associated with the companys high-profile retail stores have been reclassified to conform to the current periods presentation. refer to note 8, segment information and
geographic data of this form 10-k.the companys fiscal year is the 52 or 53-week period that ends on the last
saturday of september. the companys fiscal years 2012, 2011 and 2010 ended on september 29, 2012, september 24, 2011, and september 25, 2010, respectively. an additional week is included in the first fiscal quarter
approximately every six years to realign fiscal quarters with calendar quarters. fiscal year 2012 spanned 53 weeks, with a 14th week included in the first quarter of 2012. fiscal years 2011 and 2010 spanned 52 weeks each. unless otherwise stated,
references to particular years or quarters refer to the companys fiscal years ended in september and the associated quarters of those fiscal years.revenue recognitionnet sales consist primarily of revenue from the sale
of hardware, software, digital content and applications, peripherals, and service and support contracts. the company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the sales price is fixed or
determinable, and collection is probable. product is considered delivered to the customer once it has been shipped and title and risk of loss have been transferred. for most of the companys product sales, these criteria are met at the time the
product is shipped. for online sales to individuals, for some sales to education customers in the u.s., and for certain other sales, the company defers revenue until the customer receives the product because the company retains a portion of the risk
of loss on these sales during transit. the company recognizes revenue from the sale of hardware products, software bundled with hardware that is essential to the functionality of the hardware, and third-party digital content sold on the itunes store
in accordance with general revenue recognition accounting guidance. the company recognizes revenue in accordance with industry specific software accounting guidance for the following types of sales transactions: (i) standalone sales of software
products, (ii) sales of software upgrades and (iii) sales of software bundled with hardware not essential to the functionality of the hardware.for the sale of most third-party products, the company recognizes revenue based on the gross amount billed to customers because the company establishes its own pricing for such products, retains related
inventory risk for physical products, is the primary obligor to the customer and assumes the credit risk for amounts billed to its47



customers. for third-party applications sold through the app store and mac app store and certain digital content sold through the itunes store, the company does not determine the selling price of
the products and is not the primary obligor to the customer. therefore, the company accounts for such sales on a net basis by recognizing in net sales only the commission it retains from each sale. the portion of the gross amount billed to customers
that is remitted by the company to third-party app developers and certain digital content owners is not reflected in the companys consolidated statements of operations.the company records deferred revenue when it receives payments in advance of the delivery of products or the performance of services. this includes amounts that have been deferred for unspecified and
specified software upgrade rights and non-software services that are attached to hardware and software products. the company sells gift cards redeemable at its retail and online stores, and also sells gift cards redeemable on the itunes store for
the purchase of digital content and software. the company records deferred revenue upon the sale of the card, which is relieved upon redemption of the card by the customer. revenue from applecare service and support contracts is deferred and
recognized over the service coverage periods. applecare service and support contracts typically include extended phone support, repair services, web-based support resources and diagnostic tools offered under the companys standard limited
warranty.the company records reductions to revenue for estimated commitments related to price protection and other customer
incentive programs. for transactions involving price protection, the company recognizes revenue net of the estimated amount to be refunded. for the companys other customer incentive programs, the estimated cost of these programs is recognized
at the later of the date at which the company has sold the product or the date at which the program is offered. the company also records reductions to revenue for expected future product returns based on the companys historical experience.
revenue is recorded net of taxes collected from customers that are remitted to governmental authorities, with the collected taxes recorded as current liabilities until remitted to the relevant government authority.revenue recognition for arrangements with multiple deliverablesfor multi-element arrangements that include hardware products containing software essential to the hardware products functionality, undelivered software elements that relate to the hardware
products essential software, and undelivered non-software services, the company allocates revenue to all deliverables based on their relative selling prices. in such circumstances, the company uses a hierarchy to determine the selling price to
be used for allocating revenue to deliverables: (i) vendor-specific objective evidence of fair value (vsoe), (ii) third-party evidence of selling price (tpe), and (iii) best estimate of selling price
(esp). vsoe generally exists only when the company sells the deliverable separately and is the price actually charged by the company for that deliverable. esps reflect the companys best estimates of what the selling prices of
elements would be if they were sold regularly on a stand-alone basis. for multi-element arrangements accounted for in accordance with industry specific software accounting guidance, the company allocates revenue to all deliverables based on the vsoe
of each element, and if vsoe does not exist revenue is recognized when elements lacking vsoe are delivered.for sales of
qualifying versions of iphone, ipad and ipod touch (ios devices), mac and apple tv, the company has indicated it may from time to time provide future unspecified software upgrades and features to the essential software bundled with each
of these hardware products free of charge to customers. essential software for ios devices includes ios and related applications and for mac includes os x, related applications and ilife. the company also provides various non-software services to
owners of qualifying versions of ios devices and mac. the company has identified up to three deliverables regularly included in arrangements involving the sale of these devices. the first deliverable is the hardware and software essential to the
functionality of the hardware device delivered at the time of sale. the second deliverable is the embedded right included with the purchase of ios devices, mac and apple tv to receive on a when-and-if-available basis, future unspecified software
upgrades and features relating to the products essential software. the third deliverable is the non-software services to be provided to qualifying versions of ios devices and mac. the company allocates revenue between48



these deliverables using the relative selling price method. because the company has neither vsoe nor tpe for these deliverables, the allocation of revenue is based on the companys esps.
revenue allocated to the delivered hardware and the related essential software is recognized at the time of sale provided the other conditions for revenue recognition have been met. revenue allocated to the embedded unspecified software upgrade
rights and the non-software services is deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis over the estimated period the software upgrades and non-software services are expected to be provided for each of these devices, which ranges from two to four
years. cost of sales related to delivered hardware and related essential software, including estimated warranty costs, are recognized at the time of sale. costs incurred to provide non-software services are recognized as cost of sales as incurred,
and engineering and sales and marketing costs are recognized as operating expenses as incurred.the companys process
for determining its esp for deliverables without vsoe or tpe considers multiple factors that may vary depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each deliverable. the company believes its customers would be reluctant to buy
unspecified software upgrade rights for the essential software included with its qualifying hardware products. this view is primarily based on the fact that unspecified software upgrade rights do not obligate the company to provide upgrades at a
particular time or at all, and do not specify to customers which upgrades or features will be delivered. the company also believes its customers would be unwilling to pay a significant amount for access to the non-software services because other
companies offer similar services at little or no cost to users. therefore, the company has concluded that if it were to sell upgrade rights or access to the non-software services on a standalone basis, including those rights and services attached to
ios devices, mac and apple tv, the selling prices would be relatively low. key factors considered by the company in developing the esps for software upgrade rights include prices charged by the company for similar offerings, market trends in the
pricing of apple-branded and third-party mac and ios compatible software, the nature of the upgrade rights (e.g., unspecified versus specified), and the relative esp of the upgrade rights as compared to the total selling price of the product. the
company may also consider additional factors as appropriate, including the impact of other products and services provided to customers, the pricing of competitive alternatives if they exist, product-specific business objectives, and the length of
time a particular version of a device has been available. when relevant, the same factors are considered by the company in developing esps for offerings such as the non-software services; however, the primary consideration in developing esps for the
non-software services is the estimated cost to provide such services, including consideration for a reasonable profit margin.for the three years ended september 29, 2012, the companys combined esps for the unspecified software upgrade rights and the
rights to receive the non-software services included with its qualifying hardware devices have ranged from $5 to $25. revenue allocated to such rights included with ios devices and apple tv is recognized on a straight-line basis over two years, and
revenue allocated to such rights included with mac is recognized on a straight-line basis over four years.shipping costsfor all periods presented, amounts billed to customers related to shipping and handling are classified as revenue, and the companys
shipping and handling costs are included in cost of sales.warranty expensethe company generally provides for the estimated cost of hardware and software warranties at the time the related revenue is recognized.
the company assesses the adequacy of its pre-existing warranty liabilities and adjusts the amounts as necessary based on actual experience and changes in future estimates.software development costsresearch and development costs are expensed as
incurred. development costs of computer software to be sold, leased, or otherwise marketed are subject to capitalization beginning when a products technological feasibility49



has been established and ending when a product is available for general release to customers. in most instances, the companys products are released soon after technological feasibility has
been established. costs incurred subsequent to achievement of technological feasibility were not significant, and generally software development costs were expensed as incurred during 2012, 2011 and 2010.advertising costsadvertising costs are expensed as incurred. advertising expense was $1.0 billion, $933 million and $691 million for 2012, 2011 and 2010,
respectively.share-based compensationthe company recognizes expense related to share-based payment transactions in which it receives employee services in exchange for (a) equity instruments of the company or (b) liabilities that
are based on the fair value of the enterprises equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of such equity instruments. share-based compensation cost for restricted stock units (rsus) is measured based on the closing
fair market value of the companys common stock on the date of grant. share-based compensation cost for stock options is estimated at the grant date based on each options fair-value as calculated by the black-scholes-merton
(bsm) option-pricing model. the company recognizes share-based compensation cost as expense ratably on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. the company recognizes a benefit from share-based compensation in the
consolidated statements of shareholders equity if an incremental tax benefit is realized. in addition, the company recognizes the indirect effects of share-based compensation on research and development tax credits, foreign tax credits and
domestic manufacturing deductions in the consolidated statements of operations. further information regarding share-based compensation can be found in note 6, shareholders equity and share-based compensation of this form 10-k.income taxesthe provision for income taxes is computed using the asset and liability method, under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are
recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. deferred tax assets and liabilities are
measured using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in effect for the years in which those tax assets are expected to be realized or settled. the company records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the
amount that is believed more likely than not to be realized.the company recognizes the tax benefit from an uncertain tax
position only if it is more likely than not the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are
then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon settlement. see note 5, income taxes of this form 10-k for additional information.earnings per sharebasic earnings per share is computed by dividing income available to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of shares of
common stock outstanding during the period. diluted earnings per share is computed by dividing income available to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period increased to include the
number of additional shares of common stock that would have been outstanding if the potentially dilutive securities had been issued. potentially dilutive securities include outstanding stock options, shares to be purchased under the companys
employee stock purchase plan and unvested rsus. the dilutive effect of potentially dilutive securities is reflected in diluted earnings per share by application of the treasury stock method. under the treasury stock method, an increase in50

the fair market value of the companys common stock can result in a greater dilutive effect from potentially dilutive securities.the following table shows the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share for 2012, 2011, and 2010 (in thousands, except net

shares of common stock for 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively, were excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share for these periods because their effect would have been antidilutive.financial instrumentscash
equivalents and marketable securitiesall highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less at the date of
purchase are classified as cash equivalents. the companys marketable debt and equity securities have been classified and accounted for as available-for-sale. management determines the appropriate classification of its investments at the time
of purchase and reevaluates the designations at each balance sheet date. the company classifies its marketable debt securities as either short-term or long-term based on each instruments underlying contractual maturity date. marketable debt
securities with maturities of 12 months or less are classified as short-term and marketable debt securities with maturities greater than 12 months are classified as long-term. the company classifies its marketable equity securities, including mutual
funds, as either short-term or long-term based on the nature of each security and its availability for use in current operations. the companys marketable debt and equity securities are carried at fair value, with the unrealized gains and
losses, net of taxes, reported as a component of shareholders equity. the cost of securities sold is based upon the specific identification method.derivative financial instrumentsthe company accounts for its derivative instruments as
either assets or liabilities and carries them at fair value.for derivative instruments that hedge the exposure to
variability in expected future cash flows that are designated as cash flow hedges, the effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative instrument is reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (aoci) in
shareholders equity and reclassified into income in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. the ineffective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative instrument, if any, is recognized in current
income. to receive hedge accounting treatment, cash flow hedges must be highly effective in offsetting changes to expected future cash flows on hedged transactions. for options designated as cash flow hedges, changes in the time value are excluded
from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and are recognized in income. for derivative instruments that hedge the exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset or a liability and that are designated as fair value hedges, both the net gain or
loss on the derivative instrument as well as the offsetting gain or loss on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are recognized in earnings in the current period. the company had no fair value51



hedges in 2012, 2011 and 2010. the net gain or loss on the effective portion of a derivative instrument that is designated as an economic hedge of the foreign currency translation exposure of the
net investment in a foreign operation is reported in the same manner as a foreign currency translation adjustment. for forward exchange contracts designated as net investment hedges, the company excludes changes in fair value relating to changes in
the forward carry component from its definition of effectiveness. accordingly, any gains or losses related to this component are recognized in current income. derivatives that do not qualify as hedges must be adjusted to fair value through current
income.allowance for doubtful accountsthe company records its allowance for doubtful accounts based upon its assessment of various factors. the company considers historical experience, the age of the accounts receivable balances, credit
quality of the companys customers, current economic conditions, and other factors that may affect customers ability to pay.inventoriesinventories
are stated at the lower of cost, computed using the first-in, first-out method, or market. if the cost of the inventories exceeds their market value, provisions are made currently for the difference between the cost and the market value. the
companys inventories consist primarily of components and finished goods for all periods presented.property, plant and equipmentproperty, plant and equipment are stated at cost. depreciation is computed by use of the straight-line method over the
estimated useful lives of the assets, which for buildings is the lesser of 30 years or the remaining life of the underlying building; between two to five years for machinery and equipment, including product tooling and manufacturing process
equipment; and the shorter of lease terms or ten years for leasehold improvements. the company capitalizes eligible costs to acquire or develop internal-use software that are incurred subsequent to the preliminary project stage. capitalized costs
related to internal-use software are amortized using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which range from three to five years. depreciation and amortization expense on property and equipment was $2.6 billion, $1.6
billion and $815 million during 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively.long-lived assets including goodwill and other acquired intangible
assetsthe company reviews property, plant and equipment, inventory component prepayments, and certain identifiable
intangibles, excluding goodwill, for impairment. long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. recoverability of these assets is measured by
comparison of their carrying amounts to future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate. if property, plant and equipment, inventory component prepayments, and certain identifiable intangibles are considered to be impaired, the
impairment to be recognized equals the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds its fair market value. the company did not record any significant impairments during 2012, 2011 and 2010.the company does not amortize goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives, rather such assets are required to be tested
for impairment at least annually or sooner whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the assets may be impaired. the company performs its goodwill and intangible asset impairment tests in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year. the
company did not recognize any impairment charges related to goodwill or indefinite lived intangible assets during 2012, 2011 and 2010. the company established reporting units based on its current reporting structure. for purposes of testing goodwill
for impairment, goodwill has been allocated to these reporting units to the extent it relates to each reporting unit. in 2012 and 2011, the companys goodwill was allocated to the americas and europe reportable operating segments.52



the company amortizes its intangible assets with definite lives over their estimated useful
lives and reviews these assets for impairment. the company is currently amortizing its acquired intangible assets with definite lives over periods typically from three to seven years.fair value measurementsthe company applies fair value accounting for all
financial assets and liabilities and non-financial assets and liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis. the company defines fair value as the price that would be received from
selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. when determining the fair value measurements for assets and liabilities, which are required to be recorded at fair value,
the company considers the principal or most advantageous market in which the company would transact and the market-based risk measurements or assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, such as risks inherent in
valuation techniques, transfer restrictions and credit risk. fair value is estimated by applying the following hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value into three levels and bases the categorization within the hierarchy
upon the lowest level of input that is available and significant to the fair value measurement:level 1  quoted prices in active
markets for identical assets or liabilities.level 2  observable inputs other than quoted prices in active
markets for identical assets and liabilities, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in inactive markets, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of
the assets or liabilities.level 3  inputs that are generally unobservable and typically reflect
managements estimate of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability.the
companys valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of money market funds and certain marketable equity securities were derived from quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. the valuation techniques used to
measure the fair value of all other financial instruments, all of which have counterparties with high credit ratings, were valued based on quoted market prices or model driven valuations using significant inputs derived from or corroborated by
observable market data.in accordance with the fair value accounting requirements, companies may choose to measure eligible
financial instruments and certain other items at fair value. the company has not elected the fair value option for any eligible financial instruments.foreign currency translation and remeasurementthe company translates the
assets and liabilities of its non-u.s. dollar functional currency subsidiaries into u.s. dollars using exchange rates in effect at the end of each period. revenue and expenses for these subsidiaries are translated using rates that approximate those
in effect during the period. gains and losses from these translations are recognized in foreign currency translation included in accumulated other comprehensive income in shareholders equity. the companys subsidiaries that use the u.s.
dollar as their functional currency remeasure monetary assets and liabilities at exchange rates in effect at the end of each period, and inventories, property, and nonmonetary assets and liabilities at historical rates. gains and losses from these
remeasurements were not significant and have been included in the companys results of operations.53

the net unrealized gains as of september 29, 2012 and september 24, 2011 are
related primarily to long-term marketable securities. the company may sell certain of its marketable securities prior to their stated maturities for strategic reasons including, but not limited to, anticipation of credit deterioration and duration
management. the net realized gains or losses recognized during 2012 and 2011 were $183 million and $110 million, respectively, and no significant net realized gains or losses during 2010 related to such sales. the maturities of the companys
long-term marketable securities generally range from one to five years.as of september 29, 2012 and september 24,
2011, gross unrealized losses related to individual securities that had been in a continuous loss position for 12 months or longer were not significant.as of september 29, 2012, the company considers the declines in market value of its marketable securities investment portfolio to be temporary in nature and does not consider any of its investments
other-than-temporarily impaired. the company typically invests in highly-rated securities, and its investment policy generally limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. the policy requires investments generally to be investment grade,
with the primary objective of minimizing the potential risk of principal loss. fair values were determined for each individual security in the investment portfolio. when evaluating an investment for other-than-temporary impairment, the company
reviews factors such as the length of time and extent to which fair value has been below its cost basis, the financial condition of the issuer and any changes thereto, and the companys intent to sell, or whether it is more likely than not it
will be required to sell, the investment before recovery of the investments cost basis. during 2012, 2011 and 2010, the company did not recognize any significant impairment charges.derivative financial instrumentsthe company uses derivatives to partially
offset its business exposure to foreign currency exchange risk. the company may enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts to offset some of the foreign exchange risk on expected future cash flows on certain forecasted revenue and cost
of sales, on net investments in certain foreign subsidiaries, and on certain existing assets and liabilities.to help protect
gross margins from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, certain of the companys subsidiaries whose functional currency is the u.s. dollar hedge a portion of forecasted foreign currency revenue. the companys subsidiaries whose
functional currency is not the u.s. dollar and who sell in local currencies may hedge a portion of forecasted inventory purchases not denominated in the subsidiaries functional currencies. the company typically hedges portions of its
forecasted foreign currency exposure associated with revenue and inventory purchases generally up to six months.to help
protect the net investment in a foreign operation from adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates, the company may enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts to offset the changes in the carrying amounts of these investments
due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.the company may also enter into foreign currency forward and option
contracts to partially offset the foreign currency exchange gains and losses generated by the re-measurement of certain assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies. however, the company may choose not to hedge certain foreign
currency exchange exposures for a variety of reasons including, but not limited to, accounting considerations and the prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures. there can be no assurance the hedges will offset more than a portion of
the financial impact resulting from movements in foreign currency exchange rates.the company records all derivatives in the
consolidated balance sheets at fair value. the companys accounting treatment of these instruments is based on whether the instruments are designated as hedge or non-hedge instruments. the effective portions of cash flow hedges are recorded in
aoci until the hedged item is recognized in earnings. the effective portions of net investment hedges are recorded in other comprehensive income as a part of the cumulative translation adjustment. the ineffective portions of cash flow hedges and net55

item to which the derivative relates.the company had a net deferred loss associated with cash flow hedges of approximately
$240 million and a net deferred gain of approximately $290 million, net of taxes, recorded in aoci as of september 29, 2012 and september 24, 2011, respectively. deferred gains and losses associated with cash flow hedges of foreign
currency revenue are recognized as a component of net sales in the same period as the related revenue is recognized, and deferred gains and losses related to cash flow hedges of inventory purchases are recognized as a component of cost of sales in
the same period as the related costs are recognized. the majority of the companys hedged transactions as of september 29, 2012 are expected to occur within six months.derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges must be de-designated as hedges when it is probable the forecasted hedged
transaction will not occur in the initially identified time period or within a subsequent two-month time period. deferred gains and losses in aoci associated with such derivative instruments are reclassified immediately into other income and
expense. any subsequent changes in fair value of such derivative instruments are reflected in other income and expense unless they are re-designated as hedges of other transactions. the company did not recognize any significant net gains or losses
related to the loss of hedge designation on discontinued cash flow hedges during 2012, 2011 and 2010.the companys
unrealized net gains and losses on net investment hedges, included in the cumulative translation adjustment account of aoci, were not significant as of september 29, 2012 and september 24, 2011, respectively. the ineffective portions of
and amounts excluded from the effectiveness test of net investment hedges are recorded in other income and expense.the
gain/loss recognized in other income and expense for foreign currency forward and option contracts not designated as hedging instruments was not significant during 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. these amounts represent the net gain or loss on
the derivative contracts and do not include changes in the related exposures, which generally offset a portion of the gain or loss on the derivative contracts.the following table shows the notional principal amounts of the companys outstanding derivative instruments and credit risk amounts associated with outstanding or unsettled derivative instruments as
of september 29, 2012 and september 24, 2011 (in millions):instruments designated as accounting hedges:foreign exchange contractsinstruments not designated as accounting hedges:foreign exchange contractsthe notional principal amounts for outstanding derivative instruments provide one measure of the
transaction volume outstanding and do not represent the amount of the companys exposure to credit or market loss. the credit risk amounts represent the companys gross exposure to potential accounting loss on derivative instruments that
are outstanding or unsettled if all counterparties failed to perform according to the terms of the contract, based on then-current currency exchange rates at each respective date. the companys gross exposure on these transactions may be
further mitigated by collateral received from certain counterparties. the companys exposure to credit loss and market risk will vary over time as a function of currency exchange rates. although the table above reflects the notional principal
and credit risk amounts of the companys foreign exchange56

upon settlement of these financial instruments, together with the gains and losses on the underlying exposures, will depend on actual market conditions during the remaining life of the instruments.the company generally enters into master netting arrangements, which reduce credit risk by permitting net settlement of transactions with
the same counterparty. to further limit credit risk, the company generally enters into collateral security arrangements that provide for collateral to be received or posted when the net fair value of certain financial instruments fluctuates from
contractually established thresholds. the company presents its derivative assets and derivative liabilities at their gross fair values. as of september 29, 2012, the company posted cash collateral related to the derivative instruments under its
collateral security arrangements of $278 million, which it recorded as other current assets in the consolidated balance sheet. as of september 24, 2011, the company received cash collateral related to the derivative instruments under
its collateral security arrangements of $288 million, which it recorded as accrued expenses in the consolidated balance sheet. the company did not have any derivative instruments with credit-risk related contingent features that would require it to
post additional collateral as of september 29, 2012 or september 24, 2011.the following tables show the

outstanding with its third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers, value-added resellers, small and mid-sized businesses, and education, enterprise and government customers. the company generally does not require collateral from its
customers; however, the company will require collateral in certain instances to limit credit risk. in addition, when possible, the company attempts to limit credit risk on trade receivables with credit insurance for certain customers or by requiring
third-party financing, loans or leases to support credit exposure. these credit-financing arrangements are directly between the third-party financing company and the end customer. as such, the company generally does not assume any recourse or credit
risk sharing related to any of these arrangements.as of september 29, 2012, the company had two customers that
represented 10% or more of total trade receivables, one of which accounted for 14% and the other 10%. as of september 24, 2011, there were no customers that accounted for 10% or more of the companys total trade receivables. the
companys cellular network carriers accounted for 66% and 52% of trade receivables as of september 29, 2012 and september 24, 2011, respectively. the additions and write-offs to the companys allowance for doubtful accounts

effects of temporary differences between the consolidated financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and are measured using enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in the years in
which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.uncertain tax positionstax positions are evaluated in a two-step process. the company first determines whether it is more likely than not that a tax position
will be sustained upon examination. if a tax position meets the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold it is then measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements. the tax position is measured as the largest
amount of benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. the company classifies gross interest and penalties and unrecognized tax benefits that are not expected to result in payment or receipt of cash within one
year as non-current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets.as of september 29, 2012, the total amount of gross
unrecognized tax benefits was $2.1 billion, of which $889 million, if recognized, would affect the companys effective tax rate. as of september 24, 2011, the total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits was $1.4 billion, of which

2006 and proposed certain adjustments. the company has contested certain of these adjustments through the irs appeals office. the irs is currently examining the years 2007 through 2009. in addition, the company is also subject to audits by state,
local and foreign tax authorities. in major states and major foreign jurisdictions, the years subsequent to 1989 and 2002, respectively, generally remain open and could be subject to examination by the taxing authorities.management believes that an adequate provision has been made for any adjustments that may result from tax examinations. however, the
outcome of tax audits cannot be predicted with certainty. if any issues addressed in the companys tax audits are resolved in a manner not consistent with managements expectations, the company could be required to adjust its provision for
income tax in the period such resolution occurs. although timing of the resolution and/or closure of audits is not certain, the company believes it is reasonably possible that tax audit resolutions could reduce its unrecognized tax benefits by
between $120 million and $170 million in the next 12 months.note 6  shareholders equity and share-based compensationpreferred stockthe company has five million shares of authorized preferred stock, none of which is issued or outstanding. under the terms of the companys restated articles of incorporation, the board of directors

in 2012, the companys board of directors authorized a program to repurchase up to $10
billion of the companys common stock beginning in 2013. the repurchase program is expected to be executed over a three-year period with the primary objective of neutralizing the impact of dilution from future employee equity grants and
employee stock purchase programs. the repurchase program does not obligate the company to acquire any specific number of shares. in august 2012, the company entered into a rule 10b5-1 compliant accelerated share repurchase (asr)
program with a financial institution to purchase up to $2 billion of the companys common stock during 2013. the total number of shares to be purchased under the asr program will be based on the volume-weighted average price of the
companys common stock during the purchase period and will be reflected as a reduction of shares outstanding on the date of purchase. the company may also purchase its common stock in open market transactions, in compliance with all
applicable securities laws.comprehensive incomecomprehensive income consists of two components, net income and other comprehensive income. other comprehensive income refers to revenue, expenses, and gains and losses that under gaap are recorded as an
element of shareholders equity but are excluded from net income. the companys other comprehensive income consists of foreign currency translation adjustments from those subsidiaries not using the u.s. dollar as their functional currency,
unrealized gains and losses on marketable securities classified as available-for-sale, and net deferred gains and losses on certain derivative instruments accounted for as cash flow hedges.the following table shows the components of aoci, net of taxes, as of september 29, 2012 and september 24, 2011 (in millions):net unrealized gains/losses on marketable securitiesnet unrecognized gains/losses on derivative instrumentscumulative foreign currency translationaccumulated other comprehensive incomethe change in fair value of available-for-sale securities included in other comprehensive income was

employee benefit plans2003 employee stock planthe 2003 employee stock plan (the 2003
plan) is a shareholder approved plan that provides for broad-based equity grants to employees, including executive officers. the 2003 plan permits the granting of incentive stock options, nonstatutory stock options, rsus, stock appreciation
rights, stock purchase rights and performance-based awards. options granted under the 2003 plan generally expire seven to ten years after the grant date and generally become exercisable over a period of four years, based on continued employment,
with either annual, semi-annual or quarterly vesting. in general, rsus granted under the 2003 plan vest over two to four years, based on continued employment and are settled upon vesting in shares of the companys common stock on a one-for-one
basis. each share issued with respect to an award granted under the 2003 plan (other than a stock option or stock appreciation right) reduces the number of shares available for grant under the plan by two shares, whereas shares issued in respect of
an option or stock appreciation right count against the number of shares available for grant on a one-for-one basis. all rsus, other than rsus held by the chief executive officer, granted under the 2003 plan have dividend equivalent rights
(der), which entitle holders of rsus to the same dividend value per share as holders of common stock. der are subject to the same vesting and other terms and conditions as the corresponding unvested rsus. der are accumulated and paid
when the underlying shares vest. as of september 29, 2012, approximately 37.1 million shares were reserved for future issuance under the 2003 plan.1997 director stock planthe 1997 director stock plan (the director
plan) is a shareholder approved plan that (i) permits the company to grant awards of rsus or stock options to the companys non-employee directors, (ii) provides for automatic initial grants of rsus upon a non-employee director
joining the board of directors and automatic annual grants of rsus at each annual meeting of shareholders, and (iii) permits the board of directors to prospectively change the relative mixture of stock options and rsus for the initial and
annual award grants and the methodology for determining the number of shares of the companys common stock subject to these grants without shareholder approval. each share issued with respect to rsus granted under the director plan reduces the
number of shares available for grant under the plan by two shares. the director plan expires november 9, 2019. all rsus granted under the director plan are entitled to der. as of september 29, 2012, approximately 184,000 shares were
reserved for future issuance under the director plan.rule 10b5-1 trading plansduring the fourth quarter of 2012, executive officers timothy d. cook, peter oppenheimer, d. bruce sewell, phillip w. schiller and jeffrey
e. williams, and directors william v. campbell and arthur d. levinson had equity trading plans adopted in accordance with rule 10b5-1(c)(1) under the securities exchange act of 1934, as amended (the exchange act). an equity trading plan
is a written document that pre-establishes the amounts, prices and dates (or a formula for determining the amounts, prices and dates) of future purchases or sales of the companys stock, including shares acquired pursuant to the companys
employee and director equity plans.employee stock purchase planthe employee stock purchase plan (the purchase plan) is a shareholder approved plan under which substantially all employees
may purchase the companys common stock through payroll deductions at a price equal to 85% of the lower of the fair market values of the stock as of the beginning or the end of six-month offering periods. an employees payroll deductions
under the purchase plan are limited to 10% of the employees compensation and employees may not purchase more than $25,000 of stock during any calendar year. as of september 29, 2012, approximately 2.5 million shares were reserved for
future issuance under the purchase plan.65

401(k) planthe companys 401(k) plan (the 401(k) plan) is a deferred salary arrangement under section 401(k) of the internal revenue code. under the 401(k) plan, participating u.s. employees
may defer a portion of their pre-tax earnings, up to the irs annual contribution limit ($17,000 for calendar year 2012). the company matches 50% to 100% of each employees contributions, depending on length of service, up to a maximum 6% of the
employees eligible earnings. the companys matching contributions to the 401(k) plan were $114 million, $90 million and $72 million in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively.restricted stock unitsa summary of the companys rsu activity and

for 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. the majority of rsus that vested in 2012, 2011 and 2010 were net-share settled such that the company withheld shares with value equivalent to the employees minimum statutory obligation for the applicable
income and other employment taxes, and remitted the cash to the appropriate taxing authorities. the total shares withheld were approximately 2.3 million, 1.6 million and 1.8 million for 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively, and were
based on the value of the rsus on their respective vesting dates as determined by the companys closing stock price. total payments for the employees tax obligations to taxing authorities were $1.2 billion, $520 million and $406 million
in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively, and are reflected as a financing activity within the consolidated statements of cash flows. these net-share settlements had the effect of share repurchases by the company as they reduced and retired the
number of shares that would have otherwise been issued as a result of the vesting and did not represent an expense to the company.66

for 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively.share-based compensationshare-based compensation cost for rsus is measured based on the closing fair market value of the companys common stock on the date
of grant. share-based compensation cost for stock options and employee stock purchase plan rights (stock purchase rights) is estimated at the grant date and offering date, respectively, based on the fair-value as calculated by the bsm
option-pricing model. the bsm option-pricing model incorporates various assumptions including expected volatility, estimated expected life and interest rates. the company recognizes share-based compensation cost as expense on a straight-line
basis over the requisite service period.the company did not grant any stock options during 2012. the company granted 1,370
and 34,000 stock options during 2011 and 2010, respectively. the weighted-average grant date fair value per share of stock options granted during 2011 and 2010 was $181.13 and $108.58, respectively.during 2012 and 2010, in conjunction with certain business combinations, the company assumed 41,000 and 98,000 stock options,
respectively, which had a weighted-average fair value per share of $405.39 and $216.82, respectively. the company did not assume any stock options during 2011.the weighted-average fair value of stock purchase rights per share was $108.44, $71.47 and $45.03 during 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively.67

company also offers a 90-day basic warranty for its service parts used to repair the companys hardware products. the company provides currently for the estimated cost that may be incurred under its basic limited product warranties at the time
related revenue is recognized. factors considered in determining appropriate accruals for product warranty obligations include the size of the installed base of products subject to warranty protection, historical and projected warranty claim rates,
historical and projected cost-per-claim, and knowledge of specific product failures that are outside of the companys typical experience. the company assesses the adequacy of its pre-existing warranty liabilities and adjusts the amounts as
necessary based on actual experience and changes in future estimates.the following table shows changes in the companys

against legal claims that the software infringes third-party intellectual property rights. other agreements entered into by the company sometimes include indemnification provisions under which the company could be subject to costs and/or damages in
the event of an infringement claim against the company or an indemnified third-party. however, the company has not been required to make any significant payments resulting from such an infringement claim asserted against it or an indemnified
third-party and, in the opinion of management, does not have a potential liability related to unresolved infringement claims subject to indemnification that would materially adversely affect its financial condition or operating results. therefore,
the company did not record a liability for infringement costs related to indemnification as of either september 29, 2012 or september 24, 2011.the company has entered into indemnification agreements with its directors and executive officers. under these agreements, the company has agreed to indemnify such individuals to the fullest extent
permitted by law against liabilities that arise by reason of their status as directors or officers and to advance expenses incurred by such68



individuals in connection with related legal proceedings. it is not possible to determine the maximum potential amount of payments the company could be required to make under these agreements due
to the limited history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each claim. however, the company maintains directors and officers liability insurance coverage to reduce its exposure to such obligations, and
payments made under these agreements historically have not been material.concentrations in the available sources of supply of materials
and productalthough most components essential to the companys business are generally available from multiple
sources, a number of components are currently obtained from single or limited sources, which subjects the company to significant supply and pricing risks. many components, including those that are available from multiple sources, are at times
subject to industry-wide shortages and significant commodity pricing fluctuations. in addition, the company has entered into various agreements for the supply of components; however there can be no guarantee that the company will be able to extend
or renew these agreements on similar terms, or at all. therefore, the company remains subject to significant risks of supply shortages and price increases that can materially adversely affect its financial condition and operating results.the company and other participants in the markets for mobile communication and media devices and personal computers also
compete for various components with other industries that have experienced increased demand for their products. the company also uses some custom components that are not common to the rest of these industries, and new products introduced by the
company often utilize custom components available from only one source. when a component or product uses new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers yields have matured or manufacturing capacity has increased.
if the companys supply of components for a new or existing product were delayed or constrained, or if an outsourcing partner delayed shipments of completed products to the company, the companys financial condition and operating results
could be materially adversely affected. the companys business and financial performance could also be materially adversely affected depending on the time required to obtain sufficient quantities from the original source, or to identify and
obtain sufficient quantities from an alternative source. continued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at all, may be affected if those suppliers concentrated on the production of common components instead of components
customized to meet the companys requirements.substantially all of the companys hardware products are
manufactured by outsourcing partners that are located primarily in asia. a significant concentration of this manufacturing is currently performed by a small number of outsourcing partners, often in single locations. certain of these outsourcing
partners are the sole-sourced suppliers of components and manufacturers for many of the companys products. although the company works closely with its outsourcing partners on manufacturing schedules, the companys operating results could
be adversely affected if its outsourcing partners were unable to meet their production commitments. the companys purchase commitments typically cover its requirements for periods up to 150 days.long-term supply agreementsthe company has entered into long-term agreements to secure the supply of certain inventory components. under certain of these agreements, which expire between 2012 and 2022, the company has made
prepayments for the future purchase of inventory components and has acquired capital equipment to use in the manufacturing of such components.as of september 29, 2012, the company had a total of $4.2 billion of inventory component prepayments outstanding, of which $1.2 billion are classified as other current assets and $3.0 billion are
classified as other assets in the consolidated balance sheets. the company had a total of $2.3 billion of inventory component prepayments outstanding as of september 24, 2011. the companys outstanding prepayments will be applied to
certain inventory component purchases made during the term of each respective agreement. the company utilized $943 million and $173 million of inventory component prepayments during 2012 and 2011, respectively.69

other off-balance sheet commitmentslease commitmentsthe company leases various equipment and facilities,
including retail space, under noncancelable operating lease arrangements. the company does not currently utilize any other off-balance sheet financing arrangements. the major facility leases are typically for terms not exceeding 10 years and
generally provide renewal options for terms not exceeding five additional years. leases for retail space are for terms ranging from five to 20 years, the majority of which are for 10 years, and often contain multi-year renewal options. as of
september 29, 2012, the companys total future minimum lease payments under noncancelable operating leases were $4.4 billion, of which $3.1 billion related to leases for retail space.rent expense under all operating leases, including both cancelable and noncancelable leases, was $488 million, $338 million and $271

september 29, 2012, which were comprised mainly of commitments to acquire capital assets, including product tooling and manufacturing process equipment, and commitments related to advertising, research and development, internet and
telecommunications services and other obligations.contingenciesthe company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that have arisen in the ordinary course of business and have not been fully
adjudicated, certain of which are discussed in part i, item 3 of this form 10-k under the heading legal proceedings and in part i, item 1a of this form 10-k under the heading risk factors. in the opinion of
management, there was not at least a reasonable possibility the company may have incurred a material loss, or a material loss in excess of a recorded accrual, with respect to loss contingencies. however, the outcome of litigation is inherently
uncertain. therefore, although management considers the likelihood of such an outcome to be remote, if one or more of these legal matters were resolved against the company in a reporting period for amounts in excess of managements
expectations, the companys consolidated financial statements for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected.apple

note 8  segment information and geographic datathe company reports segment information based on the management approach. the management approach
designates the internal reporting used by management for making decisions and assessing performance as the source of the companys reportable segments.the company manages its business primarily on a geographic basis. accordingly, the company determined its reportable operating segments, which are generally based on the nature and location of its
customers, to be the americas, europe, japan, asia-pacific and retail. the results of the americas, europe, japan and asia-pacific segments do not include results of the retail segment. the americas segment includes both north and south america. the
europe segment includes european countries, as well as the middle east and africa. the asia-pacific segment includes australia and asian countries, other than japan. the retail segment operates apple retail stores in 13 countries, including the u.s.
each operating segment provides similar hardware and software products and similar services. the accounting policies of the various segments are the same as those described in note 1, summary of significant accounting policies.the company evaluates the performance of its operating segments based on net sales and operating income. net sales for
geographic segments are generally based on the location of customers, while retail segment net sales are based on sales from the companys retail stores. operating income for each segment includes net sales to third parties, related cost of
sales and operating expenses directly attributable to the segment. advertising expenses are generally included in the geographic segment in which the expenditures are incurred. operating income for each segment excludes other income and expense and
certain expenses managed outside the operating segments. costs excluded from segment operating income include various corporate expenses, such as manufacturing costs and variances not included in standard costs, research and development, corporate
marketing expenses, share-based compensation expense, income taxes, various nonrecurring charges, and other separately managed general and administrative costs. prior to 2012, the company allocated to corporate expenses certain costs associated with
its high-profile retail stores that have been designed and built to promote brand awareness and serve as vehicles for corporate sales and marketing activities. beginning in 2012, the company no longer allocates these costs to corporate expenses and
reclassified $102 million and $75 million of such costs from corporate to retail segment expenses for 2011 and 2010, respectively. the company does not include intercompany transfers between segments for management reporting purposes.segment assets include receivables and inventories, and for the retail segment also includes capital assets. segment assets exclude
corporate assets, such as cash and cash equivalents, short-term and long-term marketable securities, vendor non-trade receivables, other long-term investments, manufacturing and corporate facilities, product tooling and manufacturing process
equipment, miscellaneous corporate infrastructure, goodwill and other acquired intangible assets. except for the retail segment, capital asset purchases for long-lived assets are not reported to management by segment and therefore are excluded from
the geographic segment assets and instead included in corporate assets. cash payments for capital asset purchases by the retail segment were $858 million, $612 million and $392 million for 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. the companys total
depreciation and amortization was $3.3 billion, $1.8 billion and $1.0 billion in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively, of which $319 million, $273 million and $198 million was related to the retail segment in the respective years. depreciation and
amortization on segment assets included in the geographic segments was not significant.71

the related consolidated statements of operations, shareholders equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended september 29, 2012. these financial statements are the responsibility of the companys management.
our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.we conducted our audits in
accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board (united states). those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. an audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. an audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as
well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. we believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.in our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of apple inc. at september 29, 2012 and september 24,
2011, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended september 29, 2012, in conformity with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles.we also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board (united states), apple

report of ernst & young llp, independent registered public accounting firmthe board of directors and shareholders of apple inc.we have audited apple inc.s internal control over financial reporting as of september 29, 2012, based on criteria established in internal control  integrated framework issued by
the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission (the coso criteria). apple inc.s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the
effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying managements annual report on internal control over financial reporting. our responsibility is to express an opinion on the companys internal control
over financial reporting based on our audit.we conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the public company
accounting oversight board (united states). those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. our
audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk,
and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. we believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.a companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. a companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that,
in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance
regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. also, projections
of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.in our opinion, apple inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of
september 29, 2012, based on the coso criteria.we also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the public
company accounting oversight board (united states), the 2012 consolidated financial statements of apple inc. and our report dated october 31, 2012 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon./s/ ernst & young llpsan jose, californiaoctober 31, 201276



none.evaluation of
disclosure controls and proceduresbased on an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of the
companys management, the companys principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that the companys disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the exchange act
were effective as of september 29, 2012 to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by the company in reports that it files or submits under the exchange act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported
within the time periods specified in the securities and exchange commission rules and forms and (ii) accumulated and communicated to the companys management, including its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as
appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.inherent limitations over internal controlsthe companys internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of
financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles (gaap). the companys internal control over financial reporting includes those
policies and procedures that:pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the
companys assets;provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with gaap, and
that the companys receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of the companys management and directors; andprovide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets
that could have a material effect on the financial statements.management, including the companys
chief executive officer and chief financial officer, does not expect that the companys internal controls will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. a control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable,
not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs.
because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of internal controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. also, any evaluation of the effectiveness of
controls in future periods are subject to the risk that those internal controls may become inadequate because of changes in business conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.managements annual report on internal control over financial reportingthe companys management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as
defined in rule 13a-15(f) under the exchange act). management conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of the companys internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria set forth in internal control  integrated
framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission. based on the companys assessment, management has concluded that its internal control over financial reporting was effective as of september 29, 2012
to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with gaap. the companys independent registered public accounting firm, ernst & young llp, has
issued an audit report on the companys internal control over financial reporting, which appears in part ii, item 8 of this form 10-k.77
