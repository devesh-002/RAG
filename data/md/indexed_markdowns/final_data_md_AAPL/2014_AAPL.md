## Item 1A


global markets for the companys products and services are highly competitive and subject
to rapid technological change, and the company may be unable to compete effectively in these markets.the companys products and
services compete in highly competitive global markets characterized by aggressive price cutting and resulting downward pressure on gross margins, frequent introduction of new products, short product life cycles, evolving industry standards,
continual improvement in product price/performance characteristics, rapid adoption of technological and product advancements by competitors and price sensitivity on the part of consumers.the companys ability to compete successfully depends heavily on its ability to ensure a continuing and timely introduction of innovative new
products and technologies to the marketplace. the company believes it is unique in that it designs and develops nearly the entire solution for its products, including the hardware, operating system, numerous software applications and related
services. as a result, the company must make significant investments in r&d. the company currently holds a significant number of patents and copyrights and has registered and/or has applied to register numerous patents, trademarks and service
marks. in contrast, many of the companys competitors seek to compete primarily through aggressive pricing and very low cost structures, and emulating the companys products and infringing on its intellectual property.
if the company is unable to continue to develop and sell innovative new products with attractive margins or if competitors infringe on the companys intellectual property, the companys ability to maintain a competitive advantage could be
adversely affected.the company markets certain mobile communication and media devices based on the ios mobile operating system and also markets
related third-party digital content and applications. the company faces substantial competition in these markets from companies that have significant technical, marketing, distribution and other resources, as well as established hardware, software
and digital content supplier relationships; and the company has a minority market share in the smartphone market. additionally, the company faces significant price competition as competitors reduce their selling prices and attempt to imitate the
companys product features and applications within their own products or, alternatively, collaborate with each other to offer solutions that are more competitive than those they currently offer. the company also competes with illegitimate ways
to obtain third-party digital content and applications and with business models that include content provided to users for free. some of the companys competitors have greater experience, product breadth and distribution channels than the
company. because some current and potential competitors have substantial resources and/or experience and a lower cost structure, they may be able to provide products and services at little or no profit or even at a loss. the company also expects
competition to intensify as competitors attempt to imitate the companys approach to providing components seamlessly within their individual offerings or work collaboratively to offer integrated solutions. the companys financial condition
and operating results depend substantially on the companys ability to continually improve ios and ios devices in order to maintain their functional and design advantages.the company is the only authorized maker of hardware using os x, which has a minority market share in the personal computer market. this market has been
contracting and is dominated by computer makers using competing operating systems, most notably windows. in the market for personal computers and accessories, the company faces a significant number of competitors, many of which have broader product
lines, lower priced products and a larger installed customer base. historically, consolidation in this market has resulted in larger competitors. price competition has been particularly intense as competitors selling windows-based personal computers
have aggressively cut prices and lowered product margins. an increasing number of internet-enabled devices that include software applications and are smaller and simpler than traditional personal computers compete for market share with the
companys existing products. the companys financial condition and operating results also depend on its ability to continually improve the mac platform to maintain its functional and design advantages.there can be no assurance the company will be able to continue to provide products and services that compete effectively.apple inc. | 2014 form 10-k | 10



to remain competitive and stimulate customer demand, the company must successfully manage
frequent product introductions and transitions.due to the highly volatile and competitive nature of the industries in which the company
competes, the company must continually introduce new products, services and technologies, enhance existing products and services, and effectively stimulate customer demand for new and upgraded products. the success of new product introductions
depends on a number of factors including, but not limited to, timely and successful product development, market acceptance, the companys ability to manage the risks associated with new product production ramp-up issues, the availability of
application software for new products, the effective management of purchase commitments and inventory levels in line with anticipated product demand, the availability of products in appropriate quantities and at expected costs to meet anticipated
demand, and the risk that new products may have quality or other defects or deficiencies in the early stages of introduction. accordingly, the company cannot determine in advance the ultimate effect of new product introductions and transitions.the company depends on the performance of distributors, carriers and other resellers.the company distributes its products through cellular network carriers, wholesalers, national and regional retailers, and value-added resellers, many of
whom distribute products from competing manufacturers. the company also sells its products and third-party products in most of its major markets directly to education, enterprise and government customers, and consumers and small and mid-sized
businesses through its online and retail stores.carriers providing cellular network service for iphone typically subsidize users purchases of
the device. there is no assurance that such subsidies will be continued at all or in the same amounts upon renewal of the companys agreements with these carriers or in agreements the company enters into with new carriers.many resellers have narrow operating margins and have been adversely affected in the past by weak economic conditions. some resellers have perceived the
expansion of the companys direct sales as conflicting with their business interests as distributors and resellers of the companys products. such a perception could discourage resellers from investing resources in the distribution and
sale of the companys products or lead them to limit or cease distribution of those products. the company has invested and will continue to invest in programs to enhance reseller sales, including staffing selected resellers stores with
company employees and contractors, and improving product placement displays. these programs could require a substantial investment while providing no assurance of return or incremental revenue. the financial condition of these resellers could
weaken, these resellers could stop distributing the companys products, or uncertainty regarding demand for the companys products could cause resellers to reduce their ordering and marketing of the companys products.the company faces substantial inventory and other asset risk in addition to purchase commitment cancellation risk.the company records a write-down for product and component inventories that have become obsolete or exceed anticipated demand or net realizable value and
accrues necessary cancellation fee reserves for orders of excess products and components. the company also reviews its long-lived assets, including capital assets held at its suppliers facilities and inventory prepayments, for impairment
whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. if the company determines that impairment has occurred, it records a write-down equal to the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds
its fair value. although the company believes its provisions related to inventory, capital assets, inventory prepayments and other assets and purchase commitments are currently adequate, no assurance can be given that the company will not incur
additional related charges given the rapid and unpredictable pace of product obsolescence in the industries in which the company competes.the
company must order components for its products and build inventory in advance of product announcements and shipments. consistent with industry practice, components are normally acquired through a combination of purchase orders, supplier contracts
and open orders, in each case based on projected demand. where appropriate, the purchases are applied to inventory component prepayments that are outstanding with the respective supplier. purchase commitments typically
cover forecasted component and manufacturing requirements for periods up to 150 days. because the companys markets are volatile, competitive and subject to rapid technology and price changes, there is a risk the company will forecast
incorrectly and order or produce excess or insufficient amounts of components or products, or not fully utilize firm purchase commitments.apple inc. | 2014 form 10-k | 11



future operating results depend upon the companys ability to obtain components in
sufficient quantities.because the company currently obtains components from single or limited sources, the company is subject to significant
supply and pricing risks. many components, including those that are available from multiple sources, are at times subject to industry-wide shortages and significant commodity pricing fluctuations. while the company has entered into agreements for
the supply of many components, there can be no assurance that the company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms, or at all. a number of suppliers of components may suffer from poor financial conditions, which can lead to
business failure for the supplier or consolidation within a particular industry, further limiting the companys ability to obtain sufficient quantities of components. the follow-on effects from global economic conditions on the
companys suppliers, described in global and regional economic conditions could materially adversely affect the company above, also could affect the companys ability to obtain components. therefore, the company
remains subject to significant risks of supply shortages and price increases.the company and other participants in the markets for mobile
communication and media devices and personal computers also compete for various components with other industries that have experienced increased demand for their products. the company uses some custom components that are not common to the rest of
these industries. the companys new products often utilize custom components available from only one source. when a component or product uses new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers yields have matured
or manufacturing capacity has increased. continued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at all, may be affected if those suppliers decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to
meet the companys requirements. the supply of components for a new or existing product could be delayed or constrained, or a key manufacturing vendor could delay shipments of completed products to the company.the company depends on component and product manufacturing and logistical services provided by outsourcing partners, many of whom are
located outside of the u.s.substantially all of the companys manufacturing is performed in whole or in part by a few outsourcing
partners located primarily in asia. the company has also outsourced much of its transportation and logistics management. while these arrangements may lower operating costs, they also reduce the companys direct control over production and
distribution. it is uncertain what effect such diminished control will have on the quality or quantity of products or services, or the companys flexibility to respond to changing conditions. although arrangements with these partners may
contain provisions for warranty expense reimbursement, the company may remain responsible to the consumer for warranty service in the event of product defects and could experience an unanticipated product defect or warranty liability. while the
company relies on its partners to adhere to its supplier code of conduct, material violations of the supplier code of conduct could occur.the
company relies on sole-sourced outsourcing partners in the u.s., asia and europe to supply and manufacture many critical components, and on outsourcing partners primarily located in asia, for final assembly of substantially all of the companys
hardware products. any failure of these partners to perform may have a negative impact on the companys cost or supply of components or finished goods. in addition, manufacturing or logistics in these locations or transit to final destinations
may be disrupted for a variety of reasons including, but not limited to, natural and man-made disasters, information technology system failures, commercial disputes, military actions or economic, business, labor, environmental, public health, or
political issues.the company has invested in manufacturing process equipment, much of which is held at certain of its outsourcing partners, and has
made prepayments to certain of its suppliers associated with long-term supply agreements. while these arrangements help ensure the supply of components and finished goods, if these outsourcing partners or suppliers experience severe financial
problems or other disruptions in their business, the net realizable value of these assets could be negatively impacted.the
companys products and services may experience quality problems from time to time that can result in decreased sales and operating margin and harm to the companys reputation.the company sells complex hardware and software products and services that can contain design and manufacturing defects. sophisticated operating system
software and applications, such as those sold by the company, often contain bugs that can unexpectedly interfere with the softwares intended operation. the companys online services may from time to time experience outages,
service slowdowns, or errors. defects may also occur in components and products the company purchases from third parties. there can be no assurance the company will be able to detect and fix all defects in the hardware, software and services it
sells. failure to do so could result in lost revenue, significant warranty and other expenses and harm to the companys reputation.apple inc. | 2014 form 10-k | 12



the company relies on access to third-party digital content, which may not be available to the
company on commercially reasonable terms or at all.the company contracts with numerous third parties to offer their digital content through
the itunes store. this includes the right to make available music, movies, tv shows and books currently available through the itunes store. the licensing or other distribution arrangements with these third parties are for relatively short terms and
do not guarantee the continuation or renewal of these arrangements on reasonable terms, if at all. some third-party content providers and distributors currently or in the future may offer competing products and services, and could take action to
make it more difficult or impossible for the company to license or otherwise distribute their content in the future. other content owners, providers or distributors may seek to limit the companys access to, or increase the cost of, such
content. the company may be unable to continue to offer a wide variety of content at reasonable prices with acceptable usage rules, or continue to expand its geographic reach. failure to obtain the right to make available third-party digital
content, or to make available such content on commercially reasonable terms, could have a material adverse impact on the companys financial condition and operating results.some third-party digital content providers require the company to provide digital rights management and other security solutions. if requirements change,
the company may have to develop or license new technology to provide these solutions. there is no assurance the company will be able to develop or license such solutions at a reasonable cost and in a timely manner. in addition, certain countries
have passed or may propose and adopt legislation that would force the company to license its digital rights management, which could lessen the protection of content and subject it to piracy and also could negatively affect arrangements with the
companys content providers.the companys future performance depends in part on support from
third-party software developers.the company believes decisions by customers to purchase its hardware
products depend in part on the availability of third-party software applications and services. there is no assurance that third-party developers will continue to develop and maintain software applications and
services for the companys products. if third-party software applications and services cease to be developed and maintained for the companys products, customers may choose not to buy the companys products.with respect to its mac products, the company believes the availability of third-party software applications and
services depends in part on the developers perception and analysis of the relative benefits of developing, maintaining and upgrading such software for the companys products compared to windows-based products. this analysis may be based
on factors such as the market position of the company and its products, the anticipated revenue that may be generated, expected future growth of mac sales and the costs of developing such applications and services. if the companys minority
share of the global personal computer market causes developers to question the macs prospects, developers could be less inclined to develop or upgrade software for the companys mac products and more inclined to devote their resources to
developing and upgrading software for the larger windows market.with respect to ios devices, the company relies on the continued availability and
development of compelling and innovative software applications, which are distributed through a single distribution channel, the app store. ios devices are subject to rapid technological change, and, if third-party developers are unable to or choose
not to keep up with this pace of change, third-party applications might not successfully operate and may result in dissatisfied customers. as with applications for the companys mac products, the availability and development of these
applications also depend on developers perceptions and analysis of the relative benefits of developing software for the companys ios devices rather than its competitors platforms, such as android. if developers focus their efforts
on these competing platforms, the availability and quality of applications for the companys ios devices may suffer.the company
relies on access to third-party intellectual property, which may not be available to the company on commercially reasonable terms or at all.many of the companys products include third-party intellectual property, which requires licenses from those third parties. based on past experience
and industry practice, the company believes such licenses generally can be obtained on reasonable terms. there is, however, no assurance that the necessary licenses can be obtained on acceptable terms or at all. failure to obtain the right to use
third-party intellectual property, or to use such intellectual property on commercially reasonable terms, could preclude the company from selling certain products or otherwise have a material adverse impact on the companys financial condition
and operating results.apple inc. | 2014 form 10-k | 13



the company could be impacted by unfavorable results of legal proceedings, such as being found
to have infringed on intellectual property rights.the company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that have not yet been
fully resolved and that have arisen in the ordinary course of business, and additional claims may arise in the future.for example, technology
companies, including many of the companys competitors, frequently enter into litigation based on allegations of patent infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. in addition, patent holding companies seek to monetize
patents they have purchased or otherwise obtained. as the company has grown, the intellectual property rights claims against it have increased and may continue to increase. in particular, the companys cellular enabled products compete with
mobile communication and media device companies that hold significant patent portfolios, and the number of patent claims against the company has significantly increased. the company is vigorously defending infringement actions in courts in a
number of u.s. jurisdictions and before the u.s. international trade commission, as well as internationally in various countries. the plaintiffs in these actions frequently seek injunctions and substantial damages.regardless of the scope or validity of such patents or other intellectual property rights, or the merits of any claims by potential or actual
litigants, the company may have to engage in protracted litigation. if the company is found to infringe one or more patents or other intellectual property rights, regardless of whether it can develop non-infringing technology, it may be required to
pay substantial damages or royalties to a third-party, or it may be subject to a temporary or permanent injunction prohibiting the company from marketing or selling certain products.in certain cases, the company may consider the desirability of entering into licensing agreements, although no assurance can be given that such licenses
can be obtained on acceptable terms or that litigation will not occur. these licenses may also significantly increase the companys operating expenses.regardless of the merit of particular claims, litigation may be expensive, time-consuming, disruptive to the companys operations and distracting to
management. in recognition of these considerations, the company may enter into arrangements to settle litigation.in managements opinion,
there is not at least a reasonable possibility the company may have incurred a material loss, or a material loss in excess of a recorded accrual, with respect to loss contingencies, including matters related to infringement of intellectual property
rights. however, the outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain.although management considers the likelihood of such an outcome to be remote, if
one or more legal matters were resolved against the company in a reporting period for amounts in excess of managements expectations, the companys consolidated financial statements for that reporting period could be materially adversely
affected. further, such an outcome could result in significant compensatory, punitive or trebled monetary damages, disgorgement of revenue or profits, remedial corporate measures or injunctive relief against the company that could materially
adversely affect its financial condition and operating results.the company is subject to laws and regulations worldwide, changes to
which could increase the companys costs and individually or in the aggregate adversely affect the companys business.the company
is subject to laws and regulations affecting its domestic and international operations in a number of areas. these u.s. and foreign laws and regulations affect the companys activities including, but not limited to, in areas of labor,
advertising, digital content, consumer protection, real estate, billing, e-commerce, promotions, quality of services, telecommunications, mobile communications and media, television, intellectual property ownership and infringement, tax, import and
export requirements, anti-corruption, foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions, data privacy requirements, anti-competition, environmental, health and safety.apple inc. | 2014 form 10-k | 14



by way of example, laws and regulations related to mobile communications and media devices in the many
jurisdictions in which the company operates are extensive and subject to change. such changes could include, among others, restrictions on the production, manufacture, distribution and use of devices, locking devices to a carriers network, or
mandating the use of devices on more than one carriers network. these devices are also subject to certification and regulation by governmental and standardization bodies, as well as by cellular network carriers for use on their
networks. these certification processes are extensive and time consuming, and could result in additional testing requirements, product modifications, or delays in product shipment dates, or could preclude the company from selling certain
products.compliance with these laws, regulations and similar requirements may be onerous and expensive, and they may be inconsistent from
jurisdiction to jurisdiction, further increasing the cost of compliance and doing business. any such costs, which may rise in the future as a result of changes in these laws and regulations or in their interpretation, could individually or in the
aggregate make the companys products and services less attractive to the companys customers, delay the introduction of new products in one or more regions, or cause the company to change or limit its business practices. the company has
implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations, but there can be no assurance that the companys employees, contractors, or agents will not violate such laws and regulations or the
companys policies and procedures.the companys business is subject to the risks of international operations.the company derives a significant portion of its revenue and earnings from its international operations. compliance with applicable u.s. and foreign laws
and regulations, such as import and export requirements, anti-corruption laws, tax laws, foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions, data privacy requirements, environmental laws, labor laws and anti-competition regulations,
increases the costs of doing business in foreign jurisdictions. although the company has implemented policies and procedures to comply with these laws and regulations, a violation by the companys employees, contractors, or agents could
nevertheless occur.the company also could be significantly affected by other risks associated with international activities including, but not
limited to, economic and labor conditions, increased duties, taxes and other costs and political instability. margins on sales of the companys products in foreign countries, and on sales of products that include components obtained from
foreign suppliers, could be materially adversely affected by international trade regulations, including duties, tariffs and antidumping penalties. the company is also exposed to credit and collectability risk on its trade receivables with customers
in certain international markets. there can be no assurance the company can effectively limit its credit risk and avoid losses.the
companys retail segment has required and will continue to require a substantial investment and commitment of resources and is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties.the companys retail stores have required substantial investment in equipment and leasehold improvements, information systems, inventory and
personnel. the company also has entered into substantial operating lease commitments for retail space. certain stores have been designed and built to serve as high-profile venues to promote brand awareness and serve as vehicles for corporate sales
and marketing activities. because of their unique design elements, locations and size, these stores require substantially more investment than the companys more typical retail stores. due to the high cost structure associated with the retail
segment, a decline in sales or the closure or poor performance of individual or multiple stores could result in significant lease termination costs, write-offs of equipment and leasehold improvements, and severance costs.many factors unique to retail operations, some of which are beyond the companys control, pose risks and uncertainties. these risks and
uncertainties include, but are not limited to, macro-economic factors that could have an adverse effect on general retail activity, as well as the companys inability to manage costs associated with store construction and operation, the
companys failure to manage relationships with its existing retail partners, more challenging environments in managing retail operations outside the u.s., costs associated with unanticipated fluctuations in the value of retail inventory, and
the companys inability to obtain and renew leases in quality retail locations at a reasonable cost.apple inc. | 2014 form 10-k | 15



investment in new business strategies and acquisitions could disrupt the companys ongoing
business and present risks not originally contemplated.the company has invested, and in the future may invest, in new business strategies or
acquisitions. such endeavors may involve significant risks and uncertainties, including distraction of management from current operations, greater than expected liabilities and expenses, inadequate return of capital and unidentified issues not
discovered in the companys due diligence. these new ventures are inherently risky and may not be successful.the companys
business and reputation may be impacted by information technology system failures or network disruptions.the company may be subject to
information technology system failures and network disruptions. these may be caused by natural disasters, accidents, power disruptions, telecommunications failures, acts of terrorism or war, computer viruses, physical or electronic break-ins, or
other events or disruptions. system redundancy may be ineffective or inadequate, and the companys disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities. such failures or disruptions could prevent access to the companys
online stores and services, preclude retail store transactions, compromise company or customer data, and result in delayed or cancelled orders. system failures and disruptions could also impede the manufacturing and shipping of products, delivery of
online services, transactions processing and financial reporting.there may be breaches of the companys information technology
systems that materially damage business partner and customer relationships, curtail or otherwise adversely impact access to online stores and services, or subject the company to significant reputational, financial, legal and operational
consequences.the companys business requires it to use and store customer, employee and business partner personally identifiable
information (pii). this may include, among other information, names, addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, contact preferences, tax identification numbers and payment account information. although malicious attacks to gain access to
pii affect many companies across various industries, the company is at a relatively greater risk of being targeted because of its high profile and the amount of pii it manages.the company requires user names and passwords in order to access its information technology systems. the company also uses encryption and authentication
technologies designed to secure the transmission and storage of data and prevent access to company data or accounts. as with all companies, these security measures are subject to third-party security breaches, employee error, malfeasance, faulty
password management, or other irregularities. for example, third parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees or customers into disclosing user names, passwords or other sensitive information, which may in turn be used to access the
companys information technology systems. to help protect customers and the company, the company monitors accounts and systems for unusual activity and may freeze accounts under suspicious circumstances, which may result in the delay or loss of
customer orders.the company devotes significant resources to network security, data encryption and other security measures to protect its systems
and data, but these security measures cannot provide absolute security. to the extent the company was to experience a breach of its systems and was unable to protect sensitive data, such a breach could materially damage business partner and customer
relationships, and curtail or otherwise adversely impact access to online stores and services. moreover, if a computer security breach affects the companys systems or results in the unauthorized release of pii, the companys reputation
and brand could be materially damaged, use of the companys products and services could decrease, and the company could be exposed to a risk of loss or litigation and possible liability. while the company maintains insurance coverage that,
subject to policy terms and conditions and subject to a significant self-insured retention, is designed to address certain aspects of cyber risks, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise
in the continually evolving area of cyber risk.apple inc. | 2014 form 10-k | 16



the companys business is subject to a variety of u.s. and international laws, rules,
policies and other obligations regarding data protection.the company is subject to federal, state and international laws relating to the
collection, use, retention, security and transfer of pii. in many cases, these laws apply not only to third-party transactions, but also to transfers of information between the company and its subsidiaries, and among the company, its subsidiaries
and other parties with which the company has commercial relations. several jurisdictions have passed laws in this area, and other jurisdictions are considering imposing additional restrictions. these laws continue to develop and may be inconsistent
from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. complying with emerging and changing international requirements may cause the company to incur substantial costs or require the company to change its business practices. noncompliance could result in penalties or
significant legal liability.the companys privacy policy, which includes related practices concerning the use and disclosure of data, is
posted on its website. any failure by the company, its suppliers or other parties with whom the company does business to comply with its posted privacy policy or with other federal, state or international privacy-related or data protection laws and
regulations could result in proceedings against the company by governmental entities or others.the company is also subject to payment card
association rules and obligations under its contracts with payment card processors. under these rules and obligations, if information is compromised, the company could be liable to payment card issuers for associated expenses and penalties. in
addition, if the company fails to follow payment card industry security standards, even if no customer information is compromised, the company could incur significant fines or experience a significant increase in payment card transaction costs.the companys success depends largely on the continued service and availability of key personnel.much of the companys future success depends on the continued availability and service of key personnel, including its chief executive officer,
executive team and other highly skilled employees. experienced personnel in the technology industry are in high demand and competition for their talents is intense, especially in silicon valley, where most of the companys key personnel are
located.the companys business may be impacted by political events, war, terrorism, public health issues, natural disasters and
other business interruptions.war, terrorism, geopolitical uncertainties, public health issues and other business interruptions have caused
and could cause damage or disruption to international commerce and the global economy, and thus could have a material adverse effect on the company, its suppliers, logistics providers, manufacturing vendors and customers, including channel partners.
the companys business operations are subject to interruption by, among others, natural disasters, whether as a result of climate change or otherwise, fire, power shortages, nuclear power plant accidents, terrorist attacks and other hostile
acts, labor disputes, public health issues and other events beyond its control. such events could decrease demand for the companys products, make it difficult or impossible for the company to make and deliver products to its customers,
including channel partners, or to receive components from its suppliers, and create delays and inefficiencies in the companys supply chain. should major public health issues, including pandemics, arise, the company could be adversely affected
by more stringent employee travel restrictions, additional limitations in freight services, governmental actions limiting the movement of products between regions, delays in production ramps of new products and disruptions in the operations of the
companys manufacturing vendors and component suppliers. the majority of the companys r&d activities, its corporate headquarters, information technology systems and other critical business operations, including certain component
suppliers and manufacturing vendors, are in locations that could be affected by natural disasters. in the event of a natural disaster, the company could incur significant losses, require substantial recovery time and experience significant
expenditures in order to resume operations.apple inc. | 2014 form 10-k | 17



the company expects its quarterly revenue and operating results to fluctuate.the companys profit margins vary across its products and distribution channels. the companys software, accessories, and service and support
contracts generally have higher gross margins than certain of the companys other products. gross margins on the companys hardware products vary across product lines and can change over time as a result of product transitions, pricing and
configuration changes, and component, warranty, and other cost fluctuations. the companys direct sales generally have higher associated gross margins than its indirect sales through its channel partners. in addition, the companys gross
margin and operating margin percentages, as well as overall profitability, may be materially adversely impacted as a result of a shift in product, geographic or channel mix, component cost increases, the strengthening u.s. dollar, price competition,
or the introduction of new products, including those that have higher cost structures with flat or reduced pricing.the company has typically
experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters due in part to seasonal holiday demand. additionally, new product introductions can significantly impact net sales, product costs and operating expenses. the company could
be subject to unexpected developments late in a quarter, such as lower-than-anticipated demand for the companys products, issues with new product introductions, an internal systems failure, or failure of one of the companys logistics,
components supply, or manufacturing partners.the companys stock price is subject to volatility.the companys stock price has experienced substantial price volatility in the past and may continue to do so in the future. additionally, the
company, the technology industry and the stock market as a whole have experienced extreme stock price and volume fluctuations that have affected stock prices in ways that may have been unrelated to these companies operating performance. price
volatility over a given period may cause the average price at which the company repurchases its own stock to exceed the stocks price at a given point in time. the company believes its stock price reflects expectations of future growth and
profitability. the company also believes its stock price reflects expectations that its cash dividend will continue at current levels or grow and that its current share repurchase program will be fully consummated. future dividends are subject to
declaration by the companys board of directors, and the companys share repurchase program does not obligate it to acquire any specific number of shares. if the company fails to meet any of these expectations related to future growth,
profitability, dividends, share repurchases or other market expectations, its stock price may decline significantly, which could have a material adverse impact on investor confidence and employee retention.the companys financial performance is subject to risks associated with changes in the value of the u.s. dollar versus local
currencies.the companys primary exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates relates to non-u.s. dollar denominated sales
and operating expenses worldwide. weakening of foreign currencies relative to the u.s. dollar adversely affects the u.s. dollar value of the companys foreign currency-denominated sales and earnings, and generally leads the company to raise
international pricing, potentially reducing demand for the companys products. margins on sales of the companys products in foreign countries and on sales of products that include components obtained from foreign suppliers, could be
materially adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. in some circumstances, for competitive or other reasons, the company may decide not to raise local prices to fully offset the dollars strengthening, or at all, which
would adversely affect the u.s. dollar value of the companys foreign currency denominated sales and earnings. conversely, a strengthening of foreign currencies relative to the u.s. dollar, while generally beneficial to the companys
foreign currency-denominated sales and earnings, could cause the company to reduce international pricing and incur losses on its foreign currency derivative instruments, thereby limiting the benefit. additionally, strengthening of foreign currencies
may also increase the companys cost of product components denominated in those currencies, thus adversely affecting gross margins.the company
uses derivative instruments, such as foreign currency forward and option contracts, to hedge certain exposures to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. the use of such hedging activities may not offset any, or more than a portion, of the
adverse financial effects of unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates over the limited time the hedges are in place.apple inc. | 2014 form 10-k | 18



the company is exposed to credit risk and fluctuations in the market values of its investment
portfolio.given the global nature of its business, the company has both domestic and international investments. credit ratings and pricing
of the companys investments can be negatively affected by liquidity, credit deterioration, financial results, economic risk, political risk, sovereign risk or other factors. as a result, the value and liquidity of the companys cash, cash
equivalents and marketable securities may fluctuate substantially. therefore, although the company has not realized any significant losses on its cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, future fluctuations in their value could result in a
significant realized loss.the company is exposed to credit risk on its trade accounts receivable, vendor non-trade receivables and
prepayments related to long-term supply agreements, and this risk is heightened during periods when economic conditions worsen.the company
distributes its products through third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers and value-added resellers. the company also sells its products directly to small and mid-sized businesses and education, enterprise and government
customers. a substantial majority of the companys outstanding trade receivables are not covered by collateral, third-party financing arrangements or credit insurance. the companys exposure to credit and collectability risk on its trade
receivables is higher in certain international markets and its ability to mitigate such risks may be limited. the company also has unsecured vendor non-trade receivables resulting from purchases of components by outsourcing partners and other
vendors that manufacture sub-assemblies or assemble final products for the company. in addition, the company has made prepayments associated with long-term supply agreements to secure supply of inventory components. as of september 27, 2014, a
significant portion of the companys trade receivables was concentrated within cellular network carriers, and its vendor non-trade receivables and prepayments related to long-term supply agreements were concentrated among a few individual
vendors located primarily in asia. while the company has procedures to monitor and limit exposure to credit risk on its trade and vendor non-trade receivables, as well as long-term prepayments, there can be no assurance such procedures will
effectively limit its credit risk and avoid losses.the company could be subject to changes in its tax rates, the adoption of new u.s.
or international tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities.the company is subject to taxes in the u.s. and numerous foreign
jurisdictions, including ireland, where a number of the companys subsidiaries are organized. due to economic and political conditions, tax rates in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change. the companys future effective
tax rates could be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, or changes in tax laws or their interpretation, including in the u.s. and
ireland. for example, in june 2014, the european commission opened a formal investigation to examine whether decisions by the tax authorities in ireland with regard to the corporate income tax to be paid by two of the companys irish
subsidiaries comply with european union rules on state aid. if the european commission were to take a final decision against ireland, it could require changes to existing tax rulings that, in turn, could increase the companys taxes in the
future. the european commission could also require ireland to recover from the company past taxes reflective of the disallowed state aid.the
company is also subject to the examination of its tax returns and other tax matters by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities and governmental bodies. the company regularly assesses the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from
these examinations to determine the adequacy of its provision for taxes. there can be no assurance as to the outcome of these examinations. if the companys effective tax rates were to increase, particularly in the u.s. or ireland, or if the
ultimate determination of the companys taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued, the companys operating results, cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected.none.apple inc. | 2014 form 10-k | 19

reductions on select products and higher cost structures on certain new products.the year-over-year decrease in gross margin in 2013 compared to

foregoing statement regarding the companys expected gross margin percentage in the first quarter of 2015 is forward-looking and could differ from actual results. the companys future gross margins can be impacted by multiple factors
including, but not limited to those set forth above in part i, item 1a of this form 10-k under the heading risk factors and those described in this paragraph. in general, the company believes gross margins will remain under downward
pressure due to a variety of factors, including continued industry wide global product pricing pressures, increased competition, compressed product life cycles, product transitions, potential increases in the cost of components and potential
strengthening of the u.s. dollar, as well as potential increases in the costs of outside manufacturing services and a potential shift in the companys sales mix towards products with lower gross margins. in response to competitive pressures,
the company expects it will continue to take product pricing actions, which would adversely affect gross margins. gross margins could also be affected by the companys ability to manage product quality and warranty costs effectively and to
stimulate demand for certain of its products. due to the companys significant international operations, financial results can be significantly affected by fluctuations in exchange rates.operating expensesoperating expenses for 2014, 2013 and 2012

compensation costs and machinery and equipment to support expanded r&d activities. the company continues to believe that focused investments in r&d are critical to its future growth and competitive position in the marketplace and are
directly related to timely development of new and enhanced products that are central to the companys core business strategy. as such, the company expects to make further investments in r&d to remain competitive.selling, general and administrative (sg&a) expensethe growth in sg&a expense during 2014 compared to 2013 was primarily due to increased headcount and related expenses, including share-based
compensation costs; higher spending on marketing, advertising and professional services; and the companys continued expansion of its retail segment. the growth in sg&a during 2013 compared to 2012 was primarily due to the companys
continued expansion of its retail segment and increased headcount and related expenses, partially offset by decreased spending on professional services.apple inc. | 2014 form 10-k | 33

debt and higher expenses associated with foreign exchange rate movements, partially offset by lower premium expenses on foreign exchange contracts and higher interest income. the year-over-year increase in other income and expense during 2013 was
due primarily to higher interest and dividend income resulting from the companys higher cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balances and lower premium expenses on foreign exchange contracts, partially offset by interest expense on
debt issued in the third quarter of 2013 and higher expenses associated with foreign exchange rate movements. the weighted-average interest rate earned by the company on its cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities was 1.11%, 1.03% and 1.03%

u.s.as of september 27, 2014, the company had deferred tax assets arising from deductible temporary differences, tax losses and tax credits of
$5.1 billion and deferred tax liabilities of $20.3 billion. management believes it is more likely than not that forecasted income, including income that may be generated as a result of certain tax planning strategies, together with future reversals
of existing taxable temporary differences, will be sufficient to fully recover the deferred tax assets. the company will continue to evaluate the realizability of deferred tax assets quarterly by assessing the need for and the amount of a valuation

satisfy its working capital needs, capital asset purchases, outstanding commitments and other liquidity requirements associated with its existing operations over the next 12 months. to provide additional flexibility in managing liquidity, the
company began accessing the commercial paper markets in the third quarter of 2014. the company currently anticipates the cash used for future dividends and the share repurchase program will come from its current domestic cash, cash generated from
on-going u.s. operating activities and from borrowings.as of september 27, 2014 and september 28, 2013, $137.1 billion and $111.3
billion, respectively, of the companys cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities were held by foreign subsidiaries and are generally based in u.s. dollar-denominated holdings. amounts held by
foreign subsidiaries are generally subject to u.s. income taxation on repatriation to the u.s. the companys marketable securities investment portfolio is invested primarily in highly-rated securities and its investment policy generally limits
the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. the policy requires investments generally to be investment grade with the objective of minimizing the potential risk of principal loss.during 2014, cash generated from operating activities of $59.7 billion was a result of $39.5 billion of net income, non-cash adjustments to net income of
$13.2 billion and an increase in net change in operating assets and liabilities of $7.0 billion. cash used in investing activities of $22.6 billion during 2014 consisted primarily of cash used for purchases of marketable securities, net of sales and
maturities, of $9.0 billion; cash used to acquire property, plant and equipment of $9.6 billion; and cash paid for business acquisitions, net of cash acquired, of $3.8 billion. cash used in financing activities of $37.5 billion during 2014 consisted
primarily of cash used to repurchase common stock of $45.0 billion and cash used to pay dividends and dividend equivalents of $11.1 billion, partially offset by net proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt and commercial paper of $12.0
billion and $6.3 billion, respectively.during 2013, cash generated from operating activities of $53.7 billion was a result of $37.0 billion of net
income, non-cash adjustments to net income of $10.2 billion and an increase in net change in operating assets and liabilities of $6.5 billion. cash used in investing activities of $33.8 billion during 2013 consisted primarily of cash used for
purchases of marketable securities, net of sales and maturities, of $24.0 billion and cash used to acquire property, plant and equipment of $8.2 billion. cash used in financing activities of $16.4 billion during 2013 consisted primarily of cash used
to repurchase common stock of $22.9 billion and cash used to pay dividends and dividend equivalents of $10.6 billion, partially offset by net proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt of $16.9 billion.apple inc. | 2014 form 10-k | 35



capital assetsthe companys capital expenditures were $11.0 billion during 2014, consisting of $491 million for retail store facilities and $10.5 billion for other
capital expenditures, including product tooling and manufacturing process equipment and other corporate facilities and infrastructure. the companys actual cash payments for capital expenditures during 2014 were $9.6 billion.the company anticipates utilizing approximately $13.0 billion for capital expenditures during 2015, including approximately $600 million for retail store
facilities and approximately $12.4 billion for other capital expenditures, including product tooling and manufacturing process equipment, data centers and corporate facilities and infrastructure, including information systems hardware, software and
enhancements.during 2015, the company expects to open about 25 new retail stores, with approximately three-quarters located outside of the u.s.
during 2015, the company also expects to remodel approximately five of its existing stores.debtin april 2014, the board of directors authorized the company to issue unsecured short-term promissory notes (commercial paper) pursuant to a
commercial paper program. the company intends to use the net proceeds from the commercial paper program for general corporate purposes, including dividends and share repurchases. as of september 27, 2014, the company had $6.3 billion of
commercial paper outstanding, with a weighted-average interest rate of 0.12% and maturities generally less than nine months.in the third quarter of
2014 and 2013, the company issued $12.0 billion and $17.0 billion of long-term debt, respectively. the debt issuances included floating- and fixed-rate notes with varying maturities for an aggregate principal amount of $29.0 billion (collectively
the notes). the company has entered, and may enter in the future, into interest rate swaps to manage interest rate risk on the notes. interest rate swaps allow the company to effectively convert fixed-rate payments into floating-rate
payments or floating-rate payments into fixed-rate payments. in the third quarter of 2014, the company entered into interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional amount of $9.0 billion, which effectively converted most of the fixed-rate notes into
floating-rate notes, and in the third quarter of 2013, the company entered into interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional amount of $3.0 billion, which effectively converted the floating-rate notes into fixed-rate notes.capital return programin april 2014, the companys board
of directors increased the share repurchase program authorization from $60 billion to $90 billion of the companys common stock, of which $67.9 billion had been utilized as of september 27, 2014. the share repurchase program is expected to
be completed by the end of december 2015. the companys share repurchase program does not obligate it to acquire any specific number of shares. under the program, shares may be repurchased in privately negotiated or open market transactions,
including under plans complying with rule 10b5-1 under the exchange act.apple inc. | 2014 form 10-k | 36

the increase to the companys share repurchase program authorization resulted in a total capital return
program of over $130 billion. the company expects to complete the capital return program by the end of december 2015 by paying dividends and dividend equivalents, repurchasing shares and remitting withheld taxes related to net share settlement of
restricted stock units. to assist in funding its capital return program, the company expects to access the debt markets, both domestically and internationally.the following table presents the companys dividends, dividend equivalents, share repurchases and net share settlement activity from the start of

purchase commitmentsthe company utilizes several outsourcing partners to manufacture sub-assemblies for the companys products and to perform final assembly and testing
of finished products. these outsourcing partners acquire components and build product based on demand information supplied by the company, which typically covers periods up to 150 days. the company also obtains individual components for its products
from a wide variety of individual suppliers. consistent with industry practice, the company acquires components through a combination of purchase orders, supplier contracts and open orders based on projected demand information. where
appropriate, the purchases are applied to inventory component prepayments that are outstanding with the respective supplier.other
obligationsthe companys other obligations were comprised mainly of commitments to acquire capital assets, including product tooling and
manufacturing process equipment and commitments related to advertising, r&d, internet and telecommunications services and other obligations.the
companys other non-current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets consist primarily of deferred tax liabilities, gross unrecognized tax benefits and the related gross interest and penalties. as of september 27, 2014, the company
had non-current deferred tax liabilities of $20.3 billion. additionally, as of september 27, 2014, the company had gross unrecognized tax benefits of $4.0 billion and an additional $630 million for gross interest and penalties classified as
non-current liabilities. at this time, the company is unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments in individual years in connection with these tax liabilities; therefore, such amounts are not included in the above
contractual obligation table.indemnificationthe company
generally does not indemnify end-users of its operating system and application software against legal claims that the software infringes third-party intellectual property rights. other agreements entered into by the company sometimes include
indemnification provisions under which the company could be subject to costs and/or damages in the event of an infringement claim against the company or an indemnified third-party. however, the company has not been required to make any significant
payments resulting from such an infringement claim asserted against it or an indemnified third-party. in the opinion of management, there was not at least a reasonable possibility the company may have incurred a material loss with respect to
indemnification of end-users of its operating system or application software for infringement of third-party intellectual property rights. the company did not record a liability for infringement costs related to indemnification as of
september 27, 2014 or september 28, 2013.the company has entered into indemnification agreements with its directors and executive
officers. under these agreements, the company has agreed to indemnify such individuals to the fullest extent permitted by law against liabilities that arise by reason of their status as directors or officers and to advance expenses incurred by such
individuals in connection with related legal proceedings. it is not possible to determine the maximum potential amount of payments the company could be required to make under these agreements due to the limited history of prior indemnification
claims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each claim. however, the company maintains directors and officers liability insurance coverage to reduce its exposure to such obligations and payments made under these agreements historically
have not been material.apple inc. | 2014 form 10-k | 38



critical accounting policies and estimatesthe preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles (gaap) and
the companys discussion and analysis of its financial condition and operating results require the companys management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported in its consolidated financial statements
and accompanying notes. note 1, summary of significant accounting policies of the notes to consolidated financial statements in part ii, item 8 of this form 10-k describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in
the preparation of the companys consolidated financial statements. management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the
basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. actual results may differ from these estimates and such differences may be material.management believes the companys critical accounting policies and estimates are those related to revenue recognition, valuation and impairment of
marketable securities, inventory valuation and valuation of manufacturing-related assets and estimated purchase commitment cancellation fees, warranty costs, income taxes and legal and other contingencies. management considers these policies
critical because they are both important to the portrayal of the companys financial condition and operating results, and they require management to make judgments and estimates about inherently uncertain matters. the companys senior
management has reviewed these critical accounting policies and related disclosures with the audit and finance committee of the companys board of directors.revenue recognitionnet sales consist primarily of revenue
from the sale of hardware, software, digital content and applications, accessories, and service and support contracts. the company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the sales price is fixed
or determinable and collection is probable. product is considered delivered to the customer once it has been shipped and title, risk of loss and rewards of ownership have been transferred. for most of the companys product sales, these criteria
are met at the time the product is shipped. for online sales to individuals, for some sales to education customers in the u.s., and for certain other sales, the company defers revenue until the customer receives the product because the company
retains a portion of the risk of loss on these sales during transit. the company recognizes revenue from the sale of hardware products, software bundled with hardware that is essential to the functionality of the hardware and third-party digital
content sold on the itunes store in accordance with general revenue recognition accounting guidance. the company recognizes revenue in accordance with industry specific software accounting guidance for the following types of sales transactions:
(i) standalone sales of software products, (ii) sales of software upgrades and (iii) sales of software bundled with hardware not essential to the functionality of the hardware.for multi-element arrangements that include hardware products containing software essential to the hardware products functionality, undelivered
software elements that relate to the hardware products essential software and/or undelivered non-software services, the company allocates revenue to all deliverables based on their relative selling prices. in such circumstances, the company
uses a hierarchy to determine the selling price to be used for allocating revenue to deliverables: (i) vendor-specific objective evidence of fair value (vsoe), (ii) third-party evidence of selling price (tpe) and
(iii) best estimate of selling price (esp). vsoe generally exists only when the company sells the deliverable separately and is the price actually charged by the company for that deliverable. esps reflect the companys best
estimates of what the selling prices of elements would be if they were sold regularly on a stand-alone basis.for sales of qualifying versions of
ios devices, mac and apple tv, the company has indicated it may from time to time provide future unspecified software upgrades and features free of charge to customers. the company also provides various non-software services to owners of qualifying
versions of ios devices and mac. because the company has neither vsoe nor tpe for the unspecified software upgrade rights or the non-software services, revenue is allocated to these rights and services based on the companys esps. revenue
allocated to the unspecified software upgrade rights and non-software services based on the companys esps is deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis over the estimated period the software upgrades and non-software services are
expected to be provided for each of these devices, which ranges from two to four years.apple inc. | 2014 form 10-k | 39



the companys process for determining esps involves managements judgment and considers multiple
factors that may vary over time depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each deliverable. should future facts and circumstances change, the companys esps and the future rate of related amortization for software upgrades
and non-software services related to future sales of these devices could change. factors subject to change include the unspecified software upgrade rights offered, the estimated value of unspecified software upgrade rights, the estimated or actual
costs incurred to provide non-software services and the estimated period software upgrades and non-software services are expected to be provided.the company records reductions to revenue for estimated commitments related to price protection and other customer incentive programs. for transactions
involving price protection, the company recognizes revenue net of the estimated amount to be refunded, provided the refund amount can be reasonably and reliably estimated and the other conditions for revenue recognition have been met. the
companys policy requires that, if refunds cannot be reliably estimated, revenue is not recognized until reliable estimates can be made or the price protection lapses. for the companys other customer incentive programs, the estimated cost
is recognized at the later of the date at which the company has sold the product or the date at which the program is offered. the company also records reductions to revenue for expected future product returns based on the companys historical
experience. future market conditions and product transitions may require the company to increase customer incentive programs that could result in reductions to future revenue. additionally, certain customer incentive programs require management to
estimate the number of customers who will actually redeem the incentive. managements estimates are based on historical experience and the specific terms and conditions of particular incentive programs. if a greater than estimated proportion of
customers redeems such incentives, the company would be required to record additional reductions to revenue, which would have an adverse impact on the companys results of operations.valuation and impairment of marketable securitiesthe
companys investments in available-for-sale securities are reported at fair value. unrealized gains and losses related to changes in the fair value of securities are recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income, net of tax, in the
companys consolidated balance sheets. changes in the fair value of available-for-sale securities impact the companys net income only when such securities are sold or an other-than-temporary impairment is recognized. realized gains and
losses on the sale of securities are determined by specific identification of each securitys cost basis. the company regularly reviews its investment portfolio to determine if any security is other-than-temporarily impaired, which would
require the company to record an impairment charge in the period any such determination is made. in making this judgment, the company evaluates, among other things, the duration and extent to which the fair value of a security is less than its cost;
the financial condition of the issuer and any changes thereto; and the companys intent to sell, or whether it will more likely than not be required to sell, the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis. the companys
assessment on whether a security is other-than-temporarily impaired could change in the future due to new developments or changes in assumptions related to any particular security.inventory valuation and valuation of manufacturing-related assets and estimated purchase commitment cancellation feesthe company must order components for its products and build inventory in advance of product shipments and has invested in manufacturing process
equipment, including capital assets held at its suppliers facilities. in addition, the company has made prepayments to certain of its suppliers associated with long-term supply agreements to secure supply of inventory components. the company
records a write-down for inventories of components and products, including third-party products held for resale, which have become obsolete or are in excess of anticipated demand or net realizable value. the company performs a detailed review of
inventory that considers multiple factors including demand forecasts, product life cycle status, product development plans, current sales levels and component cost trends. the company also reviews its manufacturing-related capital assets and
inventory prepayments for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. if the company determines that an asset is not recoverable, it records an impairment loss equal to the amount
by which the carrying value of such an asset exceeds its fair value.apple inc. | 2014 form 10-k | 40



the industries in which the company competes are subject to a rapid and unpredictable pace of product and
component obsolescence and demand changes. in certain circumstances the company may be required to record additional write-downs of inventory, inventory prepayments and/or manufacturing-related capital assets. these circumstances include future
demand or market conditions for the companys products being less favorable than forecasted, unforeseen technological changes or changes to the companys product development plans that negatively impact the utility of any of these assets,
or significant deterioration in the financial condition of one or more of the companys suppliers that hold any of the companys manufacturing process equipment or to whom the company has made an inventory prepayment. such write-downs
would adversely affect the companys results of operations in the period when the write-downs were recorded.the company records accruals for
estimated cancellation fees related to component orders that have been cancelled or are expected to be cancelled. consistent with industry practice, the company acquires components through a combination of purchase orders, supplier contracts and
open orders in each case based on projected demand. where appropriate, the purchases are applied to inventory component prepayments that are outstanding with the respective supplier. purchase commitments typically cover the companys
forecasted component and manufacturing requirements for periods up to 150 days. if there is an abrupt and substantial decline in demand for one or more of the companys products, if the companys product development plans change, or if
there is an unanticipated change in technological requirements for any of the companys products, then the company may be required to record additional accruals for cancellation fees that would adversely affect its results of operations in the
period when the cancellation fees are identified and recorded.warranty coststhe company provides for the estimated cost of warranties at the time the related revenue is recognized based on historical and projected warranty claim
rates, historical and projected cost-per-claim and knowledge of specific product failures that are outside of the companys typical experience. each quarter, the company re-evaluates these estimates to assess the adequacy of its recorded
warranty liabilities considering the size of the installed base of products subject to warranty protection and adjusts the amounts as necessary. if actual product failure rates or repair costs differ from estimates, revisions to the estimated
warranty liabilities would be required and could materially affect the companys results of operations.income taxesthe company records a tax provision for the anticipated tax consequences of the reported results of operations. the provision for income taxes is computed
using the asset and liability method, under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, and for
operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in effect for the years in which those tax assets are expected to be realized or
settled. the company records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is believed more likely than not to be realized.the company recognizes tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on
examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood
of being realized upon ultimate settlement.management believes it is more likely than not that forecasted income, including income that may be
generated as a result of certain tax planning strategies, together with future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, will be sufficient to fully recover the deferred tax assets. in the event that the company determines all or part of
the net deferred tax assets are not realizable in the future, the company will make an adjustment to the valuation allowance that would be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made. in addition, the calculation of tax liabilities
involves significant judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of gaap and complex tax laws. resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with managements expectations could have a material impact on
the companys financial condition and operating results.apple inc. | 2014 form 10-k | 41

issuances included floating- and fixed-rate notes with varying maturities for an aggregate principal amount of $29.0 billion (collectively the notes). the company has entered, and may enter in the future, into interest rate swaps to
manage interest rate risk on the notes. interest rate swaps allow the company to effectively convert fixed-rate payments into floating-rate payments or floating-rate payments into fixed-rate payments. in the third quarter of 2014, the company
entered into interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional amount of $9.0 billion, which effectively converted most of the fixed-rate notes into floating-rate notes, and in the third quarter of 2013, the company entered into interest rate swaps
with an aggregate notional amount of $3.0 billion, which effectively converted the floating-rate notes into fixed-rate notes. as of september 27, 2014, a 100 basis point increase in market interest rates would cause interest expense on the
companys debt to increase by $110 million on an annualized basis.further details regarding the companys debt is provided in part ii,
item 8 of this form 10-k in the notes to consolidated financial statements in note 6, debt.foreign
currency riskin general, the company is a net receiver of currencies other than the u.s. dollar. accordingly, changes in exchange rates, and in
particular a strengthening of the u.s. dollar, will negatively affect the companys net sales and gross margins as expressed in u.s. dollars. there is a risk that the company will have to adjust local currency product pricing due to competitive
pressures when there have been significant volatility in foreign currency exchange rates.the company may enter into foreign currency forward and
option contracts with financial institutions to protect against foreign exchange risks associated with certain existing assets and liabilities, certain firmly committed transactions, forecasted future cash flows and net investments in foreign
subsidiaries. the companys practice is to hedge a portion of its material foreign exchange exposures, typically for up to 12 months. however, the company may choose not to hedge certain foreign exchange exposures for a variety of reasons,
including but not limited to accounting considerations and the prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures.to provide a meaningful
assessment of the foreign currency risk associated with certain of the companys foreign currency derivative positions, the company performed a sensitivity analysis using a value-at-risk (var) model to assess the potential impact of
fluctuations in exchange rates. the var model consisted of using a monte carlo simulation to generate thousands of random market price paths assuming normal market conditions. the var is the maximum expected loss in fair value, for a given
confidence interval, to the companys foreign currency derivative positions due to adverse movements in rates. the var model is not intended to represent actual losses but is used as a risk estimation and management tool. the model assumes
normal market conditions. forecasted transactions, firm commitments and assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies were excluded from the model. based on the results of the model, the company estimates with 95% confidence a maximum
one-day loss in fair value of $240 million as of september 27, 2014 compared to a maximum one-day loss in fair value of $201 million as of september 28, 2013. because the company uses foreign currency instruments for hedging purposes, the
loss in fair value incurred on those instruments are generally offset by increases in the fair value of the underlying exposures.actual future
gains and losses associated with the companys investment portfolio and derivative positions may differ materially from the sensitivity analyses performed as of september 27, 2014 due to the inherent limitations associated with predicting
the timing and amount of changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchanges rates and the companys actual exposures and positions.apple inc. | 2014 form 10-k | 43

notes to consolidated financial statementsnote 1  summary of significant accounting policiesapple inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries (collectively apple or the company) designs, manufactures and
markets mobile communication and media devices, personal computers and portable digital music players, and sells a variety of related software, services, accessories, networking solutions and third-party digital content and applications. the company
sells its products worldwide through its retail stores, online stores and direct sales force, as well as through third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers and value-added resellers. in addition, the company sells a variety of
third-party iphone, ipad, mac and ipod compatible products, including application software, and various accessories through its online and retail stores. the company sells to consumers, small and mid-sized businesses, and education, enterprise and
government customers.basis of presentation and preparationthe accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the company. intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. the
preparation of these consolidated financial statements in conformity with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles (gaap) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in these consolidated
financial statements and accompanying notes. actual results could differ materially from those estimates.the companys fiscal year is the 52
or 53-week period that ends on the last saturday of september. the companys fiscal years 2014, 2013 and 2012 ended on september 27, 2014, september 28, 2013 and september 29, 2012, respectively. an additional week is
included in the first fiscal quarter approximately every six years to realign fiscal quarters with calendar quarters. fiscal years 2014 and 2013 spanned 52 weeks each. fiscal year 2012 spanned 53 weeks, with a 14th week included in the first
quarter of 2012. unless otherwise stated, references to particular years, quarters, months and periods refer to the companys fiscal years ended in september and the associated quarters, months and periods of those fiscal years.during the first quarter of 2014, the company adopted updated accounting standards that (i) required disclosure of additional information about the
amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income (aoci) by component and (ii) required gross and net disclosures about offsetting assets and liabilities. the adoption of these updated standards only impacted the
disclosures in the notes to consolidated financial statements; accordingly, the adoption had no impact on the companys financial position or results of operations. the company has provided these additional disclosures in this form 10-k in note 8, comprehensive income and note 2, financial instruments, respectively.common
stock spliton june 6, 2014, the company effected a seven-for-one stock split to shareholders of record as of june 2, 2014. all share
and per share information has been retroactively adjusted to reflect the stock split.revenue recognitionnet sales consist primarily of revenue from the sale of hardware, software, digital content and applications, accessories and service and support
contracts. the company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the sales price is fixed or determinable and collection is probable. product is considered delivered to the customer once it has been
shipped and title, risk of loss and rewards of ownership have been transferred. for most of the companys product sales, these criteria are met at the time the product is shipped. for online sales to individuals, for some sales to education
customers in the u.s., and for certain other sales, the company defers revenue until the customer receives the product because the company retains a portion of the risk of loss on these sales during transit. the company recognizes revenue from the
sale of hardware products, software bundled with hardware that is essential to the functionality of the hardware, and third-party digital content sold on the itunes store in accordance with general revenue recognition accounting guidance. the
company recognizes revenue in accordance with industry specific software accounting guidance for the following types of sales transactions: (i) standalone sales of software products, (ii) sales of software upgrades and (iii) sales of
software bundled with hardware not essential to the functionality of the hardware.apple inc. | 2014 form 10-k | 50



for the sale of most third-party products, the company recognizes revenue based on the gross amount billed
to customers because the company establishes its own pricing for such products, retains related inventory risk for physical products, is the primary obligor to the customer and assumes the credit risk for amounts billed to its customers. for
third-party applications sold through the app store and mac app store and certain digital content sold through the itunes store, the company does not determine the selling price of the products and is not the primary obligor to the customer.
therefore, the company accounts for such sales on a net basis by recognizing in net sales only the commission it retains from each sale. the portion of the gross amount billed to customers that is remitted by the company to third-party app
developers and certain digital content owners is not reflected in the companys consolidated statements of operations.the company records
deferred revenue when it receives payments in advance of the delivery of products or the performance of services. this includes amounts that have been deferred for unspecified and specified software upgrade rights and non-software services that are
attached to hardware and software products. the company sells gift cards redeemable at its retail and online stores, and also sells gift cards redeemable on the itunes store for the purchase of digital content and software. the company records
deferred revenue upon the sale of the card, which is relieved upon redemption of the card by the customer. revenue from applecare service and support contracts is deferred and recognized over the service coverage periods. applecare service and
support contracts typically include extended phone support, repair services, web-based support resources and diagnostic tools offered under the companys standard limited warranty.the company records reductions to revenue for estimated commitments related to price protection and other customer incentive programs. for transactions
involving price protection, the company recognizes revenue net of the estimated amount to be refunded. for the companys other customer incentive programs, the estimated cost of these programs is recognized at the later of the date at which the
company has sold the product or the date at which the program is offered. the company also records reductions to revenue for expected future product returns based on the companys historical experience. revenue is recorded net of taxes
collected from customers that are remitted to governmental authorities, with the collected taxes recorded as current liabilities until remitted to the relevant government authority.revenue recognition for arrangements with multiple deliverablesfor multi-element arrangements that include hardware products containing software essential to the hardware products functionality, undelivered
software elements that relate to the hardware products essential software, and undelivered non-software services, the company allocates revenue to all deliverables based on their relative selling prices. in such circumstances, the company uses
a hierarchy to determine the selling price to be used for allocating revenue to deliverables: (i) vendor-specific objective evidence of fair value (vsoe), (ii) third-party evidence of selling price (tpe) and
(iii) best estimate of selling price (esp). vsoe generally exists only when the company sells the deliverable separately and is the price actually charged by the company for that deliverable. esps reflect the companys best
estimates of what the selling prices of elements would be if they were sold regularly on a stand-alone basis. for multi-element arrangements accounted for in accordance with industry specific software accounting guidance, the company allocates
revenue to all deliverables based on the vsoe of each element, and if vsoe does not exist revenue is recognized when elements lacking vsoe are delivered.for sales of qualifying versions of iphone, ipad and ipod touch (ios devices), mac and apple tv, the company has indicated it may from time
to time provide future unspecified software upgrades and features to the essential software bundled with each of these hardware products free of charge to customers. essential software for ios devices includes ios and related applications and for
mac includes os x and related applications. the company also provides various non-software services to owners of qualifying versions of ios devices and mac. the company has identified up to three deliverables regularly included in arrangements
involving the sale of these devices. the first deliverable is the hardware and software essential to the functionality of the hardware device delivered at the time of sale. the second deliverable is the embedded right included with the purchase of
ios devices, mac and apple tv to receive on a when-and-if-available basis, future unspecified software upgrades and features relating to the products essential software. the third deliverable is the non-software services to be provided to
qualifying versions of ios devices and mac. the company allocates revenue between these deliverables using the relative selling price method. because the company has neither vsoe nor tpe for these deliverables, the allocation of revenue is based on
the companys esps. revenue allocated to the delivered hardware and the related essential software is recognized at the time of sale provided the other conditions for revenue recognition have been met. revenue allocated to the embedded
unspecifiedapple inc. | 2014 form 10-k | 51



software upgrade rights and the non-software services is deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis over the estimated period the software upgrades and non-software services are expected to
be provided for each of these devices, which ranges from two to four years. cost of sales related to delivered hardware and related essential software, including estimated warranty costs, are recognized at the time of sale. costs incurred to provide
non-software services are recognized as cost of sales as incurred, and engineering and sales and marketing costs are recognized as operating expenses as incurred.the companys process for determining its esp for deliverables without vsoe or tpe considers multiple factors that may vary depending upon the
unique facts and circumstances related to each deliverable. the company believes its customers would be reluctant to buy unspecified software upgrade rights for the essential software included with its qualifying hardware products. this view is
primarily based on the fact that unspecified software upgrade rights do not obligate the company to provide upgrades at a particular time or at all, and do not specify to customers which upgrades or features will be delivered. the company also
believes its customers would be unwilling to pay a significant amount for access to the non-software services because other companies offer similar services at little or no cost to users. therefore, the company has concluded that if it were to sell
upgrade rights or access to the non-software services on a standalone basis, including those rights and services attached to ios devices, mac and apple tv, the selling prices would be relatively low. key factors considered by the company in
developing the esps for software upgrade rights include prices charged by the company for similar offerings, market trends in the pricing of apple-branded and third-party mac and ios compatible software, the nature of the upgrade rights (e.g.,
unspecified versus specified) and the relative esp of the upgrade rights as compared to the total selling price of the product. the company may also consider additional factors as appropriate, including the impact of other products and services
provided to customers, the pricing of competitive alternatives if they exist, product-specific business objectives and the length of time a particular version of a device has been available. when relevant, the same factors are considered by the
company in developing esps for offerings such as the non-software services with additional consideration given to the estimated cost to provide such services.in 2014, 2013 and 2012, the companys combined esps for the unspecified software upgrade rights and the rights to receive the non-software services
included with its qualifying hardware devices have ranged from $5 to $40. as of september 27, 2014, the combined esps for mac was $40 and for iphone and ipad ranged from $15 to $25. revenue allocated to such rights is deferred and recognized on
a straight-line basis over the estimated period the rights are expected to be provided for each device, which ranges from two to four years.shipping costsfor all periods presented, amounts billed to customers related to shipping and handling are classified as revenue, and the companys
shipping and handling costs are included in cost of sales.warranty coststhe company generally provides for the estimated cost of hardware and software warranties at the time the related revenue is recognized. the company
assesses the adequacy of its pre-existing warranty liabilities and adjusts the amounts as necessary based on actual experience and changes in future estimates.software development costsresearch and development
(r&d) costs are expensed as incurred. development costs of computer software to be sold, leased, or otherwise marketed are subject to capitalization beginning when a products technological feasibility has been established and
ending when a product is available for general release to customers. in most instances, the companys products are released soon after technological feasibility has been established. costs incurred subsequent to achievement of technological
feasibility were not significant, and software development costs were expensed as incurred during 2014, 2013 and 2012.advertising costsadvertising costs are expensed as incurred and included in selling, general and administrative expenses. advertising expense was $1.2 billion, $1.1
billion and $1.0 billion for 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.apple inc. | 2014 form 10-k | 52

share-based compensationthe company recognizes expense related to share-based payment transactions in which it receives employee services in exchange for (a) equity
instruments of the company or (b) liabilities that are based on the fair value of the enterprises equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of such equity instruments. share-based compensation cost for restricted stock and
restricted stock units (rsus) is measured based on the closing fair market value of the companys common stock on the date of grant. the company recognizes share-based compensation cost over the awards requisite service period
on a straight-line basis for time-based rsus and on a graded basis for rsus that are contingent on the achievement of performance metrics. the company recognizes a benefit from share-based compensation in the consolidated statements of
shareholders equity if an incremental tax benefit is realized. in addition, the company recognizes the indirect effects of share-based compensation on r&d tax credits, foreign tax credits and domestic manufacturing deductions in the
consolidated statements of operations. further information regarding share-based compensation can be found in note 9, benefit plans of this form 10-k.income taxesthe provision for income taxes is computed using
the asset and liability method, under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and for
operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in effect for the years in which those tax assets are expected to be realized or
settled. the company records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is believed more likely than not to be realized.the company recognizes the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not the tax position will be sustained on
examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood
of being realized upon settlement. see note 5, income taxes of this form 10-k for additional information.earnings per sharebasic earnings per share is computed by dividing income available to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock
outstanding during the period. diluted earnings per share is computed by dividing income available to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period increased to include the number of
additional shares of common stock that would have been outstanding if the potentially dilutive securities had been issued. potentially dilutive securities include outstanding stock options, shares to be purchased under the companys employee
stock purchase plan, unvested restricted stock and unvested rsus. the dilutive effect of potentially dilutive securities is reflected in diluted earnings per share by application of the treasury stock method. under the treasury stock method, an
increase in the fair market value of the companys common stock can result in a greater dilutive effect from potentially dilutive securities.the following table shows the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share for 2014, 2013 and 2012 (net income in millions and shares in

financial instrumentscash
equivalents and marketable securitiesall highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase are
classified as cash equivalents. the companys marketable debt and equity securities have been classified and accounted for as available-for-sale. management
determines the appropriate classification of its investments at the time of purchase and reevaluates the designations at each balance sheet date. the company classifies its marketable debt securities as either short-term or long-term based on each
instruments underlying contractual maturity date. marketable debt securities with maturities of 12 months or less are classified as short-term and marketable debt securities with maturities greater than 12 months are classified as long-term.
the company classifies its marketable equity securities, including mutual funds, as either short-term or long-term based on the nature of each security and its availability for use in current operations. the companys marketable debt and equity
securities are carried at fair value, with the unrealized gains and losses, net of taxes, reported as a component of shareholders equity. the cost of securities sold is based upon the specific identification method.derivative financial instrumentsthe company accounts for its
derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities and carries them at fair value.for derivative instruments that hedge the exposure to
variability in expected future cash flows that are designated as cash flow hedges, the effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative instrument is reported as a component of aoci in shareholders equity and reclassified into income in
the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. the ineffective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative instrument, if any, is recognized in current income. to receive hedge accounting treatment, cash flow
hedges must be highly effective in offsetting changes to expected future cash flows on hedged transactions. for options designated as cash flow hedges, changes in the time value are excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and are
recognized in income. for derivative instruments that hedge the exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset or a liability and that are designated as fair value hedges, both the net gain or loss on the derivative instrument as well as the
offsetting gain or loss on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are recognized in earnings in the current period. for derivative instruments designated as a hedge of the foreign currency translation exposure of the net investment in a
foreign operation, the net gain or loss on the effective portion of the derivative instrument is reported in the same manner as a foreign currency translation adjustment. for forward exchange contracts designated as net investment hedges, the
company excludes changes in fair value relating to changes in the forward carry component from its definition of effectiveness. accordingly, any gains or losses related to this component are recognized in current income. derivatives that do not
qualify as hedges are adjusted to fair value through current income.allowance for doubtful accountsthe company records its allowance for doubtful accounts based upon its assessment of various factors. the company considers historical experience, the age
of the accounts receivable balances, credit quality of the companys customers, current economic conditions and other factors that may affect customers ability to pay.inventoriesinventories are stated at the lower of cost,
computed using the first-in, first-out method, or market. if the cost of the inventories exceeds their market value, provisions are made currently for the difference between the cost and the market value.property, plant and equipmentproperty, plant and equipment
are stated at cost. depreciation is computed by use of the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which for buildings is the lesser of 30 years or the remaining life of the
underlying building; between two to five years for machinery and equipment, including product tooling and manufacturing process equipment; and the shorter of lease terms or ten years for leasehold improvements. the company capitalizes eligible costs
to acquire or develop internal-use software that are incurred subsequent to the preliminary project stage. capitalized costs related to internal-use software are amortized using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets,
which range from three to five years. depreciation and amortization expense on property and equipment was $6.9 billion, $5.8 billion and $2.6 billion during 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.apple inc. | 2014 form 10-k | 54



long-lived assets including goodwill and other acquired intangible assetsthe company reviews property, plant and equipment, inventory component prepayments and certain identifiable intangibles, excluding goodwill, for
impairment. long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. recoverability of these assets is measured by comparison of their carrying amounts
to future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate. if property, plant and equipment, inventory component prepayments and certain identifiable intangibles are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized equals the
amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds its fair value. the company did not record any significant impairments during 2014, 2013 and 2012.the company does not amortize goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives, rather such assets are required to be tested for impairment at
least annually or sooner whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the assets may be impaired. the company performs its goodwill and intangible asset impairment tests in the fourth quarter of each year. the company did not recognize
any impairment charges related to goodwill or indefinite lived intangible assets during 2014, 2013 and 2012. the company established reporting units based on its current reporting structure. for purposes of testing goodwill for impairment, goodwill
has been allocated to these reporting units to the extent it relates to each reporting unit. in 2014 and 2013, the companys goodwill was allocated to the americas and europe reportable operating segments.the company amortizes its intangible assets with definite useful lives over their estimated useful lives and reviews these assets for impairment. the
company typically amortizes its acquired intangible assets with definite useful lives over periods from three to seven years.fair value measurementsthe company applies fair value accounting for all financial assets and liabilities and non-financial assets and liabilities that are recognized or
disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis. the company defines fair value as the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants
at the measurement date. when determining the fair value measurements for assets and liabilities, which are required to be recorded at fair value, the company considers the principal or most advantageous market in which the company would transact
and the market-based risk measurements or assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, such as risks inherent in valuation techniques, transfer restrictions and credit risk. fair value is estimated by applying
the following hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value into three levels and bases the categorization within the hierarchy upon the lowest level of input that is available and significant to the fair value measurement:level 1  quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.level 2  observable inputs other than quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities, quoted prices for identical or
similar assets or liabilities in inactive markets, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.level 3  inputs that are generally unobservable and typically reflect managements estimate of assumptions that market participants
would use in pricing the asset or liability.the companys valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of money market funds and
certain marketable equity securities were derived from quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. the valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of the companys debt instruments and all other financial
instruments, all of which have counterparties with high credit ratings, were valued based on quoted market prices or model driven valuations using significant inputs derived from or corroborated by observable market data.in accordance with the fair value accounting requirements, companies may choose to measure eligible financial instruments and certain other items at fair
value. the company has not elected the fair value option for any eligible financial instruments.apple inc. | 2014 form 10-k | 55

foreign currency translation and remeasurementthe company translates the assets and liabilities of its non-u.s. dollar functional currency subsidiaries into u.s. dollars using exchange rates in effect
at the end of each period. revenue and expenses for these subsidiaries are translated using rates that approximate those in effect during the period. gains and losses from these translations are recognized in foreign currency translation included in
aoci in shareholders equity. the companys subsidiaries that use the u.s. dollar as their functional currency remeasure monetary assets and liabilities at exchange rates in effect at the end of each period, and inventories, property and
nonmonetary assets and liabilities at historical rates. gains and losses from these remeasurements were not significant during 2014, 2013 and 2012 and have been included in the companys results of operations.note 2  financial instrumentscash, cash equivalents and marketable securitiesthe following tables show the companys cash and available-for-sale

including, but not limited to, anticipation of credit deterioration and duration management. the net realized gains or losses recognized by the company, related to such sales, were not significant during 2014, 2013 and 2012. the maturities of the
companys long-term marketable securities generally range from one to five years.as of september 27, 2014 and september 28, 2013,
gross unrealized losses related to individual securities that had been in a continuous loss position for 12 months or longer were not significant.as of september 27, 2014, the company considers the declines in market value of its marketable securities investment portfolio to be temporary in
nature and does not consider any of its investments other-than-temporarily impaired. the company typically invests in highly-rated securities, and its investment policy limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. the policy generally
requires investments to be investment grade, with the primary objective of minimizing the potential risk of principal loss. fair values were determined for each individual security in the investment portfolio. when evaluating an investment for
other-than-temporary impairment, the company reviews factors such as the length of time and extent to which fair value has been below its cost basis, the financial condition of the issuer and any changes thereto, changes in market interest rates,
and the companys intent to sell, or whether it is more likely than not it will be required to sell, the investment before recovery of the investments cost basis. during 2014, 2013 and 2012 the company did not recognize any significant
impairment charges.apple inc. | 2014 form 10-k | 57



derivative financial instrumentsthe company uses derivatives to partially offset its business exposure to foreign currency and interest rate risk. the company may enter into forward
contracts, option contracts, swaps, or other derivative instruments to offset some of the risk on expected future cash flows, on net investments in certain foreign subsidiaries and on certain existing assets and liabilities. however, the company may
choose not to hedge certain exposures for a variety of reasons including, but not limited to, accounting considerations and the prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures. there can be no assurance the hedges will offset more than a
portion of the financial impact resulting from movements in foreign currency exchange or interest rates.to help protect gross margins from
fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, certain of the companys subsidiaries whose functional currency is the u.s. dollar hedge a portion of forecasted foreign currency revenue. the companys subsidiaries whose functional
currency is not the u.s. dollar and who sell in local currencies may hedge a portion of forecasted inventory purchases not denominated in the subsidiaries functional currencies. the company typically hedges portions of its forecasted foreign
currency exposure associated with revenue and inventory purchases, typically for up to 12 months.to help protect the net investment in a foreign
operation from adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates, the company may enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts to offset the changes in the carrying amounts of these investments due to fluctuations in foreign currency
exchange rates.the company may also enter into foreign currency forward contracts and option contracts to partially offset the foreign currency
exchange gains and losses generated by the re-measurement of certain assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies.the company
may enter into interest rate swaps, options, or other instruments to manage interest rate risk. these instruments may offset a portion of changes in income or expense, or changes in fair value of the companys long-term debt or investments.the company records all derivatives in the consolidated balance sheets at fair value. the companys accounting treatment for these instruments
is based on the hedge designation. the effective portions of cash flow hedges are recorded in aoci until the hedged item is recognized in earnings. gains and losses related to changes in fair value hedges are recognized in earnings along with a
corresponding loss or gain related to the change in value of the underlying hedged item. the effective portions of net investment hedges are recorded in other comprehensive income (oci) as a part of the cumulative translation adjustment.
the ineffective portions of cash flow hedges and net investment hedges are recorded in other income and expense. derivatives that are not designated as hedging instruments are adjusted to fair value through earnings in the financial statement line
item to which the derivative relates.deferred gains and losses associated with cash flow hedges of foreign currency revenue are recognized as a
component of net sales in the same period as the related revenue is recognized, and deferred gains and losses related to cash flow hedges of inventory purchases are recognized as a component of cost of sales in the same period as the related costs
are recognized. deferred gains and losses associated with cash flow hedges of interest income or expense are recognized as a component of other income/(expense), net in the same period as the related income or expense is recognized. the
companys foreign currency and interest rate transactions hedged with cash flow hedges as of september 27, 2014 are expected to occur within 12 months and four years, respectively.derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges must be de-designated as hedges when it is probable the forecasted hedged transaction will not
occur in the initially identified time period or within a subsequent two-month time period. deferred gains and losses in aoci associated with such derivative instruments are reclassified immediately into other income and expense. any subsequent
changes in fair value of such derivative instruments are reflected in other income and expense unless they are re-designated as hedges of other transactions. the company did not recognize any significant net gains or losses related to the loss of
hedge designation on discontinued cash flow hedges during 2014, 2013 and 2012.the gain/loss recognized in other income and expense for foreign
currency forward and option contracts not designated as hedging instruments was not significant during 2014, 2013 and 2012. these amounts represent the net gain or loss on the derivative contracts and do not include changes in the related exposures,
which generally offset a portion of the gain or loss on the derivative contracts.apple inc. | 2014 form 10-k | 58

do not represent the amount of the companys exposure to credit or market loss. the credit risk amounts represent the companys gross exposure to potential accounting loss on derivative instruments that are outstanding or unsettled if all
counterparties failed to perform according to the terms of the contract, based on then-current currency or interest rates at each respective date. the companys gross exposure on these transactions may be
further mitigated by collateral received from certain counterparties. the companys exposure to credit loss and market risk will vary over time as currency and interest rates change. although the table above reflects the notional and credit
risk amounts of the companys derivative instruments, it does not reflect the gains or losses associated with the exposures and transactions that the instruments are intended to hedge. the amounts ultimately realized upon settlement of these
financial instruments, together with the gains and losses on the underlying exposures, will depend on actual market conditions during the remaining life of the instruments.the company generally enters into master netting arrangements, which are designed to reduce credit risk by permitting net settlement of transactions with
the same counterparty. to further limit credit risk, the company generally enters into collateral security arrangements that provide for collateral to be received or posted when the net fair value of certain financial instruments fluctuates from
contractually established thresholds. the company presents its derivative assets and derivative liabilities at their gross fair values in its consolidated balance sheets. as of september 27, 2014, the company received $2.1 billion of cash
collateral related to the derivative instruments under its collateral security arrangements, which were recorded as accrued expenses in the consolidated balance sheet. as of september 28, 2013, the company posted cash collateral related to
the derivative instruments under its collateral security arrangements of $164 million, which were recorded as other current assets in the consolidated balance sheet. the company did not have any derivative instruments with credit-risk related
contingent features that would require it to post additional collateral as of september 27, 2014 or september 28, 2013.under master
netting arrangements with the respective counterparties to the companys derivative contracts, the company is allowed to net settle transactions with a single net amount payable by one party to the other. as of september 27, 2014 and
september 28, 2013, the potential effects of these rights of set-off associated with the companys derivative contracts, including the effects of collateral, would be a reduction to both derivative assets and derivative liabilities
of $1.6 billion and $333 million, respectively, resulting in net derivative liabilities of $549 million and $57 million, respectively.apple inc. | 2014 form 10-k | 59

accounts receivabletrade
receivablesthe company has considerable trade receivables outstanding with its third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers,
value-added resellers, small and mid-sized businesses, and education, enterprise and government customers. the company generally does not require collateral from its customers; however, the company will require collateral in certain instances to
limit credit risk. in addition, when possible, the company attempts to limit credit risk on trade receivables with credit insurance for certain customers or by requiring third-party financing, loans or leases to support credit exposure. these
credit-financing arrangements are directly between the third-party financing company and the end customer. as such, the company generally does not assume any recourse or credit risk sharing related to any of these arrangements.as of september 27, 2014, the company had two customers that represented 10% or more of total trade receivables, one of which accounted for 16% and
the other 13%. as of september 28, 2013, the company had two customers that represented 10% or more of total trade receivables, one of which accounted for 13% and the other 10%. the companys cellular network carriers accounted for 72% and
68% of trade receivables as of september 27, 2014 and september 28, 2013, respectively. the additions and write-offs to the companys allowance for doubtful accounts during 2014, 2013 and 2012 were not significant.vendor non-trade receivablesthe company has non-trade
receivables from certain of its manufacturing vendors resulting from the sale of components to these manufacturing vendors who manufacture sub-assemblies or assemble final products for the company. the company purchases these components directly
from suppliers. three of the companys vendors accounted for 51%, 16% and 14% of total vendor non-trade receivables as of september 27, 2014 and three of the companys vendors accounted for 47%, 21% and 15% of total vendor non-trade
receivables as of september 28, 2013. the company does not reflect the sale of these components in net sales and does not recognize any profits on these sales until the related products are sold by the company, at which time any profit is
recognized as a reduction of cost of sales.note 3  consolidated financial statement detailsthe following tables show the companys consolidated balance sheet details as of september 27, 2014 and september 28,

the foreign provision for income taxes is based on foreign pre-tax earnings of $33.6 billion, $30.5 billion
and $36.8 billion in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. the companys consolidated financial statements provide for any related tax liability on undistributed earnings that the company does not intend to be indefinitely reinvested outside
the u.s. substantially all of the companys undistributed international earnings intended to be indefinitely reinvested in operations outside the u.s. were generated by subsidiaries organized in ireland, which has a statutory tax rate of 12.5%.
as of september 27, 2014, u.s. income taxes have not been provided on a cumulative total of $69.7 billion of such earnings. the amount of unrecognized deferred tax liability related to these temporary differences is estimated to be
approximately $23.3 billion.as of september 27, 2014 and september 28, 2013, $137.1 billion and $111.3 billion, respectively, of the
companys cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities were held by foreign subsidiaries and are generally based in u.s. dollar-denominated holdings. amounts held by foreign subsidiaries are generally

temporary differences between the consolidated financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and are measured using enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in the years in which those
temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.uncertain tax positionstax positions are evaluated in a two-step process. the company first determines whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained
upon examination. if a tax position meets the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold it is then measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements. the tax position is measured as the largest amount of benefit
that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. the company classifies gross interest and penalties and unrecognized tax benefits that are not expected to result in payment or receipt of cash within one year as
non-current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets.as of september 27, 2014, the total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits was
$4.0 billion, of which $1.4 billion, if recognized, would affect the companys effective tax rate. as of september 28, 2013, the total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits was $2.7 billion, of which $1.4 billion, if recognized,
would affect the companys effective tax rate.the aggregate changes in the balance of gross unrecognized tax benefits, which excludes interest

the company includes interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within the provision for
income taxes. as of september 27, 2014 and september 28, 2013, the total amount of gross interest and penalties accrued was $630 million and $590 million, respectively, which is classified as non-current liabilities in the consolidated
balance sheets. in connection with tax matters, the company recognized interest and penalty expense in 2014, 2013 and 2012 of $40 million, $189 million and $140 million, respectively.the company is subject to taxation and files income tax returns in the u.s. federal jurisdiction and in many state and foreign jurisdictions. during the
fiscal year ended september 27, 2014, the u.s. internal revenue service (irs) concluded its review of the years 2004 through 2009, which resulted in the company reducing its gross unrecognized tax benefits by $570 million and
recognizing a tax benefit of $166 million. the irs is currently examining the years 2010 through 2012. in addition, the company is also subject to audits by state, local and foreign tax authorities. in major states and major foreign
jurisdictions, the years subsequent to 1996 and 2002, respectively, generally remain open and could be subject to examination by the taxing authorities.management believes that an adequate provision has been made for any adjustments that may result from tax examinations. however, the outcome of tax
audits cannot be predicted with certainty. if any issues addressed in the companys tax audits are resolved in a manner not consistent with managements expectations, the company could be required to adjust its provision for income taxes
in the period such resolution occurs. although timing of the resolution and/or closure of audits is not certain, the company does not believe it is reasonably possible that its unrecognized tax benefits would materially change in the next 12 months.note 6  debtcommercial paperin april 2014, the board of directors authorized the company to issue unsecured short-term promissory notes (commercial paper) pursuant to a
commercial paper program. the company intends to use net proceeds from the commercial paper program for general corporate purposes, including dividends and share repurchases. as of september 27, 2014, the company had $6.3 billion of commercial

notional amount of $9.0 billion, which effectively converted the fixed-rate notes due 2017, 2019, 2021 and 2024 into floating-rate notes. in the third quarter of 2013, the company entered into interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional
amount of $3.0 billion, which effectively converted the floating-rate notes due 2016 and 2018 into fixed-rate notes.the effective rates for the

share repurchase programin 2012, the companys board of directors authorized a program to repurchase up to $10 billion of the companys common stock beginning in 2013.
the companys board of directors increased the share repurchase authorization to $60 billion in april 2013 and to $90 billion in april 2014. as of september 27, 2014, $67.9 billion of the $90 billion had been utilized. the companys
share repurchase program does not obligate it to acquire any specific number of shares. under the program, shares may be repurchased in privately negotiated and/or open market transactions, including under plans complying with rule 10b5-1 under the
securities exchange act of 1934, as amended (the exchange act).the company has entered into four accelerated share repurchase
arrangements (asrs) with financial institutions beginning in august 2012. in exchange for up-front payments, the financial institutions deliver shares of the companys common stock during the purchase periods of each asr. the total
number of shares ultimately delivered, and therefore the average repurchase price paid per share, will be determined at the end of the applicable purchase period of each asr based on the volume weighted-average price of the companys common
stock during that period. the shares received are retired in the periods they are delivered, and the up-front payments are accounted for as a reduction to shareholders equity in the companys
consolidated balance sheet in the periods the payments are made. the company reflects the asrs as a repurchase of common stock in the period delivered for purposes of calculating earnings per share and as forward contracts indexed to its own common
stock. the asrs met all of the applicable criteria for equity classification, and therefore, were not accounted for as derivative instruments.the

2014, shareholders approved the 2014 employee stock plan (the 2014 plan) and terminated the companys authority to grant new awards under the 2003 employee stock plan (the 2003 plan). the 2014 plan provides for
broad-based equity grants to employees, including executive officers, and permits the granting of rsus, stock grants, performance-based awards, stock options and stock appreciation rights, as well as cash bonus awards. rsus granted under the 2014
plan generally vest over four years, based on continued employment, and are settled upon vesting in shares of the companys common stock on a one-for-one basis. each share issued with respect to rsus granted under the 2014 plan reduces the
number of shares available for grant under the plan by two shares. rsus cancelled and shares withheld to satisfy tax withholding obligations increase the number of shares available for grant under the 2014 plan utilizing a factor of two times the
number of rsus cancelled or shares withheld. currently, all rsus granted under the 2014 plan have dividend equivalent rights (ders), which entitle holders of rsus to the same dividend value per share as holders of common stock. ders are
subject to the same vesting and other terms and conditions as the corresponding unvested rsus. ders are accumulated and paid when the underlying shares vest. upon approval of the 2014 plan, the company reserved 385 million shares plus the
number of shares remaining that were reserved but not issued under the 2003 plan. shares subject to outstanding awards under the 2003 plan that expire, are cancelled or otherwise terminate, or are withheld to satisfy tax withholding obligations with
respect to rsus, will also be available for awards under the 2014 plan. as of september 27, 2014, approximately 492.6 million shares were reserved for future issuance under the 2014 plan.2003 employee stock planthe 2003 plan is a shareholder
approved plan that provided for broad-based equity grants to employees, including executive officers. the 2003 plan permitted the granting of incentive stock options, nonstatutory stock options, rsus, stock appreciation rights, stock purchase rights
and performance-based awards. options granted under the 2003 plan generally expire seven to ten years after the grant date and generally become exercisable over a period of four years, based on continued employment, with either annual, semi-annual
or quarterly vesting. rsus granted under the 2003 plan generally vest over two to four years, based on continued employment and are settled upon vesting in shares of the companys common stock on a one-for-one basis. all rsus, other than rsus
held by the chief executive officer, granted under the 2003 plan have ders. ders are subject to the same vesting and other terms and conditions as the corresponding unvested rsus. ders are accumulated and paid when the underlying shares vest. in the
second quarter of 2014, the company terminated the authority to grant new awards under the 2003 plan.apple inc. | 2014 form 10-k | 71



1997 director stock planthe 1997 director stock plan (the director plan) is a shareholder approved plan that (i) permits the company to grant awards of rsus or
stock options to the companys non-employee directors, (ii) provides for automatic initial grants of rsus upon a non-employee director joining the board of directors and automatic annual grants of rsus at each annual meeting of
shareholders, and (iii) permits the board of directors to prospectively change the relative mixture of stock options and rsus for the initial and annual award grants and the methodology for determining the number of shares of the companys
common stock subject to these grants without shareholder approval. each share issued with respect to rsus granted under the director plan reduces the number of shares available for grant under the plan by two shares. the director plan expires
november 9, 2019. all rsus granted under the director plan are entitled to ders. ders are subject to the same vesting and other terms and conditions as the corresponding unvested rsus. ders are accumulated and paid when the underlying shares
vest. as of september 27, 2014, approximately 1.2 million shares were reserved for future issuance under the director plan.rule 10b5-1 trading plansduring the fourth quarter of 2014, section 16 officers timothy d. cook, luca maestri, daniel riccio, philip w. schiller, d. bruce sewell and
jeffrey e. williams had equity trading plans in place in accordance with rule 10b5-1(c)(1) under the exchange act. an equity trading plan is a written document that pre-establishes the amounts, prices and
dates (or formula for determining the amounts, prices and dates) of future purchases or sales of the companys stock, including shares acquired pursuant to the companys employee and director equity plans.employee stock purchase planthe employee stock purchase plan
(the purchase plan) is a shareholder approved plan under which substantially all employees may purchase the companys common stock through payroll deductions at a price equal to 85% of the lower of the fair market values of the
stock as of the beginning or the end of six-month offering periods. an employees payroll deductions under the purchase plan are limited to 10% of the employees compensation and employees may not purchase more than $25,000 of stock during
any calendar year. as of september 27, 2014, approximately 7.6 million shares were reserved for future issuance under the purchase plan.401(k) planthe companys 401(k) plan is a deferred salary arrangement under section 401(k) of the internal revenue code. under the 401(k) plan,
participating u.s. employees may defer a portion of their pre-tax earnings, up to the irs annual contribution limit ($17,500 for calendar year 2014). the company matches 50% to 100% of each employees contributions, depending on length of
service, up to a maximum 6% of the employees eligible earnings. the companys matching contributions to the 401(k) plan were $163 million, $135 million and $114 million in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.apple inc. | 2014 form 10-k | 72

and 2012, respectively. the majority of rsus that vested in 2014, 2013 and 2012 were net-share settled such that the company withheld shares with value equivalent to the employees minimum statutory obligation for the applicable income and
other employment taxes, and remitted the cash to the appropriate taxing authorities. the total shares withheld were approximately 15.6 million, 15.5 million and 16.1 million for 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively, and were based on the
value of the rsus on their respective vesting dates as determined by the companys closing stock price. total payments for the employees tax obligations to taxing authorities were $1.2 billion, $1.1 billion and $1.2 billion in 2014,
2013 and 2012, respectively, and are reflected as a financing activity within the consolidated statements of cash flows. these net-share settlements had the effect of share repurchases by the company as they reduced and retired the number of
shares that would have otherwise been issued as a result of the vesting and did not represent an expense to the company.stock optionsthe company had 6.6 million stock options outstanding as of september 27, 2014, with a weighted-average exercise price per share of $21.99 and
weighted-average remaining contractual term of 1.4 years, substantially all of which are exercisable. the aggregate intrinsic value of the stock options outstanding as of september 27, 2014 was $520 million, which represents the value of the
companys closing stock price on the last trading day of the period in excess of the weighted-average exercise price multiplied by the number of options outstanding. total intrinsic value of options at time of exercise was $1.5 billion, $1.0
billion and $2.3 billion for 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.apple inc. | 2014 form 10-k | 73

for 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. as of september 27, 2014, the total unrecognized compensation cost related to outstanding stock options, rsus and restricted stock was $6.3 billion, which the company expects to recognize over a
weighted-average period of 2.9 years.note 10  commitments and contingenciesaccrued warranty and indemnificationthe company offers a basic
limited parts and labor warranty on its hardware products. the basic warranty period for hardware products is typically one year from the date of purchase by the end-user. the company also offers a 90-day
basic warranty for its service parts used to repair the companys hardware products. the company provides currently for the estimated cost that may be incurred under its basic limited product warranties at the time related revenue is
recognized. factors considered in determining appropriate accruals for product warranty obligations include the size of the installed base of products subject to warranty protection, historical and projected warranty claim rates, historical and
projected cost-per-claim and knowledge of specific product failures that are outside of the companys typical experience. the company assesses the adequacy of its pre-existing warranty liabilities and adjusts the amounts as necessary based on
actual experience and changes in future estimates.the following table shows changes in the companys accrued warranties and related costs for

that the software infringes third-party intellectual property rights. other agreements entered into by the company sometimes include indemnification provisions under which the company could be subject to costs and/or damages in the event of an
infringement claim against the company or an indemnified third-party. however, the company has not been required to make any significant payments resulting from such an infringement claim asserted against it or an indemnified third-party. in the
opinion of management, there was not at least a reasonable possibility the company may have incurred a material loss with respect to indemnification of end-users of its operating system or application software for infringement of third-party
intellectual property rights. the company did not record a liability for infringement costs related to indemnification as of september 27, 2014 or september 28, 2013.the company has entered into indemnification agreements with its directors and executive officers. under these agreements, the company has agreed to
indemnify such individuals to the fullest extent permitted by law against liabilities that arise by reason of their status as directors or officers and to advance expenses incurred by such individuals in connection with related legal proceedings. it
is not possible to determine the maximum potential amount of payments the company could be required to make under these agreements due to the limited history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each
claim. however, the company maintains directors and officers liability insurance coverage to reduce its exposure to such obligations, and payments made under these agreements historically have not been material.apple inc. | 2014 form 10-k | 74

concentrations in the available sources of supply of materials and productalthough most components essential to the companys business are generally available from multiple sources, a number of components are currently
obtained from single or limited sources. in addition, the company competes for various components with other participants in the markets for mobile communication and media devices and personal computers. therefore, many components used by the
company, including those that are available from multiple sources, are at times subject to industry-wide shortage and significant pricing fluctuations that could materially adversely affect the companys financial condition and operating
results.the company uses some custom components that are not commonly used by its competitors, and new products introduced by the company often
utilize custom components available from only one source. when a component or product uses new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers yields have matured or manufacturing capacity has increased. if the
companys supply of components for a new or existing product were delayed or constrained, or if an outsourcing partner delayed shipments of completed products to the company, the companys financial condition and operating results could be
materially adversely affected. the companys business and financial performance could also be materially adversely affected depending on the time required to obtain sufficient quantities from the original source, or to identify and obtain
sufficient quantities from an alternative source. continued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at all, may be affected if those suppliers concentrated on the production of common components instead of components customized to
meet the companys requirements.the company has entered into agreements for the supply of many components; however, there can be no guarantee
that the company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms, or at all. therefore, the company remains subject to significant risks of supply shortages and price increases that could materially adversely affect its financial
condition and operating results.substantially all of the companys hardware products are manufactured by outsourcing partners that are located
primarily in asia. a significant concentration of this manufacturing is currently performed by a small number of outsourcing partners, often in single locations. certain of these outsourcing partners are the sole-sourced suppliers of components and
manufacturers for many of the companys products. although the company works closely with its outsourcing partners on manufacturing schedules, the companys operating results could be adversely affected if its outsourcing partners were
unable to meet their production commitments. the companys purchase commitments typically cover its requirements for periods up to 150 days.other
off-balance sheet commitmentsoperating leasesthe
company leases various equipment and facilities, including retail space, under noncancelable operating lease arrangements. the company does not currently utilize any other off-balance sheet financing arrangements. the major facility leases are
typically for terms not exceeding 10 years and generally contain multi-year renewal options. leases for retail space are for terms ranging from five to 20 years, the majority of which are for 10 years, and often contain multi-year renewal options.
as of september 27, 2014, the companys total future minimum lease payments under noncancelable operating leases were $5.0 billion, of which $3.6 billion related to leases for retail space.rent expense under all operating leases, including both cancelable and noncancelable leases, was $717 million, $645 million and $488 million in 2014,
2013 and 2012, respectively. future minimum lease payments under noncancelable operating leases having remaining terms in excess of one year as of september 27, 2014, are as follows (in millions):20152016201720182019thereaftertotalapple inc. | 2014 form 10-k | 75



other commitmentsthe company utilizes several outsourcing partners to manufacture sub-assemblies for the companys products and to perform final assembly and testing
of finished products. these outsourcing partners acquire components and build product based on demand information supplied by the company, which typically covers periods up to 150 days. the company also obtains individual components for its products
from a wide variety of individual suppliers. consistent with industry practice, the company acquires components through a combination of purchase orders, supplier contracts and open orders based on projected demand information. where
appropriate, the purchases are applied to inventory component prepayments that are outstanding with the respective supplier. as of september 27, 2014, the company had outstanding off-balance sheet third-party
manufacturing commitments and component purchase commitments of $24.5 billion.in addition to the off-balance sheet commitments mentioned above, the
company had outstanding obligations of $3.4 billion as of september 27, 2014, which consisted mainly of commitments to acquire capital assets, including product tooling and manufacturing process equipment, and commitments related to
advertising, r&d, internet and telecommunications services and other obligations.contingenciesthe company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that have arisen in the ordinary course of business and that have not been fully
adjudicated. in the opinion of management, there was not at least a reasonable possibility the company may have incurred a material loss, or a material loss in excess of a recorded accrual, with respect to loss contingencies. however, the outcome of
litigation is inherently uncertain. therefore, although management considers the likelihood of such an outcome to be remote, if one or more of these legal matters were resolved against the company in a reporting period for amounts in excess of
managements expectations, the companys consolidated financial statements for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected.apple inc.

note 11  segment information and geographic datathe company reports segment information based on the management approach. the management approach designates the internal reporting used by
management for making decisions and assessing performance as the source of the companys reportable segments.the company manages its business
primarily on a geographic basis. the companys reportable operating segments consist of the americas, europe, greater china, japan, rest of asia pacific and retail operations. the americas segment includes both north and south america. the
europe segment includes european countries, as well as india, the middle east and africa. the greater china segment includes china, hong kong and taiwan. the rest of asia pacific segment includes australia and asian countries, other than those
countries included in the companys other operating segments. the results of the companys geographic segments do not include results of the retail segment. each operating segment provides similar hardware and software products and similar
services. the accounting policies of the various segments are the same as those described in note 1, summary of significant accounting policies.the company evaluates the performance of its operating segments based on net sales and operating income. net sales for geographic segments are generally
based on the location of customers, while retail segment net sales are based on sales through the companys retail stores. operating income for each segment includes net sales to third parties, related cost of sales and operating expenses
directly attributable to the segment. advertising expenses are generally included in the geographic segment in which the expenditures are incurred. operating income for each segment excludes other income and expense and certain expenses managed
outside the operating segments. costs excluded from segment operating income include various corporate expenses such as r&d, corporate marketing expenses, share-based compensation expense, income taxes, various nonrecurring charges, other
separately managed general and administrative costs and certain manufacturing period expenses. the company does not include intercompany transfers between segments for management reporting purposes.segment assets include receivables and inventories, and for the retail segment also includes capital assets. segment assets exclude corporate assets,
such as cash and cash equivalents, short-term and long-term marketable securities, vendor non-trade receivables, other long-term investments, manufacturing and corporate facilities, product tooling and manufacturing process equipment, miscellaneous
corporate infrastructure, goodwill and other acquired intangible assets. except for the retail segment, capital asset purchases for long-lived assets are not reported to management by segment and therefore are excluded from the geographic segment
assets and instead included in corporate assets. cash payments for capital asset purchases by the retail segment were $484 million, $495 million and $858 million for 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. the companys total depreciation and
amortization was $7.9 billion, $6.8 billion and $3.3 billion in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively, of which $441 million, $382 million and $319 million was related to the retail segment in the respective years. depreciation and amortization on
segment assets included in the geographic segments was not significant.as the company continues to expand its business, management believes
collaboration across its online, retail and indirect channels is integral to better serve its customers and optimize its financial results. beginning in the first quarter of 2015, management will be assessing business performance and making
decisions on a geographic basis, including the results of its retail stores in each respective geographic segment. accordingly, the company will be changing its reportable segments to align with the way the business is managed. the companys
reportable operating segments will consist of the americas, europe, greater china, japan and rest of asia pacific operations, and the retail segment will no longer be classified as a separate reportable segment. the historical segment data for prior
periods will be reclassified to reflect this change beginning in the quarterly report on form 10-q for the quarter ending december 27, 2014.apple inc. | 2014 form 10-k | 77

report of ernst & young llp, independent registered public accounting firmthe board of directors and shareholders of apple inc.we have audited apple inc.s internal control over financial reporting as of september 27, 2014, based on criteria established in internal
control  integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission (1992 framework) (the coso criteria). apple inc.s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal
control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying managements annual report on internal control over financial reporting. our responsibility
is to express an opinion on the companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.we conducted our audit in accordance
with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board (united states). those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was
maintained in all material respects. our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of
internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. we believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.a companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial
reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. a companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that
(1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as
necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors
of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. also, projections of any
evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.in our opinion, apple inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of september 27, 2014, based
on the coso criteria.we also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board (united states), the
2014 consolidated financial statements of apple inc. and our report dated october 27, 2014 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon./s/ ernst & young llpsan

none.evaluation of disclosure controls and proceduresbased on an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of the companys management, the companys principal executive officer
and principal financial officer have concluded that the companys disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the securities exchange act of 1934, as amended (the exchange act) were effective
as of september 27, 2014 to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by the company in reports that it files or submits under the exchange act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the
time periods specified in the securities and exchange commission rules and forms and (ii) accumulated and communicated to the companys management, including its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate
to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.inherent limitations over internal controlsthe companys internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles (gaap). the companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and
procedures that:pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the companys
assets;provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with gaap, and that the
companys receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of the companys management and directors; andprovide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could
have a material effect on the financial statements.management, including the companys chief executive officer and chief
financial officer, does not expect that the companys internal controls will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. a control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the
objectives of the control system are met. further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. because of the inherent limitations
in all control systems, no evaluation of internal controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. also, any evaluation of the effectiveness of controls in future periods are subject
to the risk that those internal controls may become inadequate because of changes in business conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.managements annual report on internal control over financial reportingthe companys management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in rule
13a-15(f) under the exchange act). management conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of the companys internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria set forth in internal control  integrated framework issued by the
committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission (1992 framework). based on the companys assessment, management has concluded that its internal control over financial reporting was effective as of september 27, 2014 to
provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with gaap. the companys independent registered public accounting firm, ernst & young llp, has
