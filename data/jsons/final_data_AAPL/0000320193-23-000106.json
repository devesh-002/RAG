{"Item 1A": {"0": {"tables": {}, "text": "The Company has a large, global business with sales outside the U.S. representing a majority of the Company\u2019s total net sales, and the Company believes that it generally benefits from growth in international trade. Substantially all of the Company\u2019s manufacturing is performed in whole or in part by outsourcing partners located primarily in China mainland, India, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Vietnam. Restrictions on international trade, such as tariffs and other controls on imports or exports of goods, technology or data, can materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s operations and supply chain and limit the Company\u2019s ability to offer and distribute its products and services to customers. The impact can be particularly significant if these restrictive measures apply to countries and regions where the Company derives a significant portion of its revenues and/or has significant supply chain operations. Restrictive measures can require the Company to take various actions, including changing suppliers, restructuring business relationships, and ceasing to offer third-party applications on its platforms. Changing the Company\u2019s operations in accordance with new or changed restrictions on international trade can be expensive, time-consuming and disruptive to the Company\u2019s operations. Such restrictions can be announced with little or no advance notice and the Company may not be able to effectively mitigate all adverse impacts from such measures. For example, tensions between governments, including the U.S. and China, have in the past led to tariffs and other restrictions being imposed on the Company\u2019s business. If disputes and conflicts further escalate in the future, actions by governments in response could be significantly more severe and restrictive and could materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business. Political uncertainty surrounding trade and other international disputes could also have a negative effect on consumer confidence and spending, which could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business.Many of the Company\u2019s operations and facilities, as well as critical business operations of the Company\u2019s suppliers and contract manufacturers, are in locations that are prone to earthquakes and other natural disasters. In addition, such operations and facilities are subject to the risk of interruption by fire, power shortages, nuclear power plant accidents and other industrial accidents, terrorist attacks and other hostile acts, ransomware and other cybersecurity attacks, labor disputes, public health issues, including pandemics such as the COVID-19 pandemic, and other events beyond the Company\u2019s control. Global climate change is resulting in certain types of natural disasters, such as droughts, floods, hurricanes and wildfires, occurring more frequently or with more intense effects. Such events can make it difficult or impossible for the Company to manufacture and deliver products to its customers, create delays and inefficiencies in the Company\u2019s supply and manufacturing chain, and result in slowdowns and outages to the Company\u2019s service offerings, and negatively impact consumer spending and demand in affected areas. Following an interruption to its business, the Company can require substantial recovery time, experience significant expenditures to resume operations, and lose significant sales. Because the Company relies on single or limited sources for the supply and manufacture of many critical components, a business interruption affecting such sources would exacerbate any negative consequences to the Company.The Company\u2019s operations are also subject to the risks of industrial accidents at its suppliers and contract manufacturers. While the Company\u2019s suppliers are required to maintain safe working environments and operations, an industrial accident could occur and could result in serious injuries or loss of life, disruption to the Company\u2019s business, and harm to the Company\u2019s reputation. Major public health issues, including pandemics such as the COVID-19 pandemic, have adversely affected, and could in the future materially adversely affect, the Company due to their impact on the global economy and demand for consumer products; the imposition of protective public safety measures, such as stringent employee travel restrictions and limitations on freight services and the movement of products between regions; and disruptions in the Company\u2019s operations, supply chain and sales and distribution channels, resulting in interruptions to the supply of current products and offering of existing services, and delays in production ramps of new products and development of new services.While the Company maintains insurance coverage for certain types of losses, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses that may arise.Global markets for the Company\u2019s products and services are highly competitive and subject to rapid technological change, and the Company may be unable to compete effectively in these markets.The Company\u2019s products and services are offered in highly competitive global markets characterized by aggressive price competition and resulting downward pressure on gross margins, frequent introduction of new products and services, short product life cycles, evolving industry standards, continual improvement in product price and performance characteristics, rapid adoption of technological advancements by competitors, and price sensitivity on the part of consumers and businesses.The Company\u2019s ability to compete successfully depends heavily on ensuring the continuing and timely introduction of innovative new products, services and technologies to the marketplace. The Company designs and develops nearly the entire solution for its products, including the hardware, operating system, numerous software applications and related services. As a result, the Company must make significant investments in R&D. There can be no assurance these investments will achieve expected returns, and the Company may not be able to develop and market new products and services successfully.Apple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 6"}, "1": {"tables": {}, "text": "The Company currently holds a significant number of patents, trademarks and copyrights and has registered, and applied to register, additional patents, trademarks and copyrights. In contrast, many of the Company\u2019s competitors seek to compete primarily through aggressive pricing and very low cost structures, and by imitating the Company\u2019s products and infringing on its\u00a0intellectual property. Effective intellectual property protection is not consistently available in every country in which the Company operates. If the Company is unable to continue to develop and sell innovative new products with attractive margins or if competitors infringe on the Company\u2019s intellectual property, the Company\u2019s ability to maintain a competitive advantage could be materially adversely affected.The Company has a minority market share in the global smartphone, personal computer and tablet markets. The Company faces substantial competition in these markets from companies that have significant technical, marketing, distribution and other resources, as well as established hardware, software and digital content supplier relationships. In addition, some of the Company\u2019s competitors have broader product lines, lower-priced products and a larger installed base of active devices. Competition has been particularly intense as competitors have aggressively cut prices and lowered product margins. Certain competitors have the resources, experience or cost structures to provide products at little or no profit or even at a loss. Some of the markets in which the Company competes have from time to time experienced little to no growth or contracted overall.Additionally, the Company faces significant competition as competitors imitate the Company\u2019s product features and applications within their products or collaborate to offer solutions that are more competitive than those they currently offer. The Company also expects competition to intensify as competitors imitate the Company\u2019s approach to providing components seamlessly within their offerings or work collaboratively to offer integrated solutions.The Company\u2019s services also face substantial competition, including from companies that have significant resources and experience and have established service offerings with large customer bases. The Company competes with business models that provide content to users for free. The Company also competes with illegitimate means to obtain third-party digital content and applications.The Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition depend substantially on the Company\u2019s ability to continually improve its products and services to maintain their functional and design advantages. There can be no assurance the Company will be able to continue to provide products and services that compete effectively.Business RisksTo remain competitive and stimulate customer demand, the Company must successfully manage frequent introductions and transitions of products and services.Due to the highly volatile and competitive nature of the markets and industries in which the Company competes, the Company must continually introduce new products, services and technologies, enhance existing products and services, effectively stimulate customer demand for new and upgraded products and services, and successfully manage the transition to these new and upgraded products and services. The success of new product and service introductions depends on a number of factors, including timely and successful development, market acceptance, the Company\u2019s ability to manage the risks associated with new technologies and production ramp-up issues, the availability of application software for the Company\u2019s products, the effective management of purchase commitments and inventory levels in line with anticipated product demand, the availability of products in appropriate quantities and at expected costs to meet anticipated demand, and the risk that new products and services may have quality or other defects or deficiencies. There can be no assurance the Company will successfully manage future introductions and transitions of products and services.The Company depends on component and product manufacturing and logistical services provided by outsourcing partners, many of which are located outside of the U.S.Substantially all of the Company\u2019s manufacturing is performed in whole or in part by outsourcing partners located primarily in China mainland, India, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Vietnam, and a significant concentration of this manufacturing is currently performed by a small number of outsourcing partners, often in single locations. Changes or additions to the Company\u2019s supply chain require considerable time and resources and involve significant risks and uncertainties. The Company has also outsourced much of its transportation and logistics management. While these arrangements can lower operating costs, they also reduce the Company\u2019s direct control over production and distribution. Such diminished control has from time to time and may in the future have an adverse effect on the quality or quantity of products manufactured or services provided, or adversely affect the Company\u2019s flexibility to respond to changing conditions. Although arrangements with these partners may contain provisions for product defect expense reimbursement, the Company generally remains responsible to the consumer for warranty and out-of-warranty service in the event of product defects and experiences unanticipated product defect liabilities from time to time. While the Company relies on its partners to adhere to its supplier code of conduct, violations of the supplier code of conduct occur from time to time and can materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.Apple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 7"}, "2": {"tables": {}, "text": "The Company relies on single-source outsourcing partners in the U.S., Asia and Europe to supply and manufacture many components, and on outsourcing partners primarily located in Asia, for final assembly of substantially all of the Company\u2019s hardware products. Any failure of these partners to perform can have a negative impact on the Company\u2019s cost or supply of components or finished goods. In addition, manufacturing or logistics in these locations or transit to final destinations can be disrupted for a variety of reasons, including natural and man-made disasters, information technology system failures, commercial disputes, armed conflict, economic, business, labor, environmental, public health or political issues, or international trade disputes.The Company has invested in manufacturing process equipment, much of which is held at certain of its outsourcing partners, and has made prepayments to certain of its suppliers associated with long-term supply agreements. While these arrangements help ensure the supply of components and finished goods, if these outsourcing partners or suppliers experience severe financial problems or other disruptions in their business, such continued supply can be reduced or terminated, and the recoverability of manufacturing process equipment or prepayments can be negatively impacted.Future operating results depend upon the Company\u2019s ability to obtain components in sufficient quantities on commercially reasonable terms.Because the Company currently obtains certain components from single or limited sources, the Company is subject to significant supply and pricing risks. Many components, including those that are available from multiple sources, are at times subject to industry-wide shortages and significant commodity pricing fluctuations that can materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition. For example, the global semiconductor industry has in the past experienced high demand and shortages of supply, which adversely affected the Company\u2019s ability to obtain sufficient quantities of components and products on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Such disruptions could occur in the future. While the Company has entered into agreements for the supply of many components, there can be no assurance the Company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms, or at all. Component suppliers may suffer from poor financial conditions, which can lead to business failure for the supplier or consolidation within a particular industry, further limiting the Company\u2019s ability to obtain sufficient quantities of components on commercially reasonable terms or at all. The effects of global or regional economic conditions on the Company\u2019s suppliers, described in \u201cThe Company\u2019s operations and performance depend significantly on global and regional economic conditions and adverse economic conditions can materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition,\u201d above, can also affect the Company\u2019s ability to obtain components. Therefore, the Company remains subject to significant risks of supply shortages and price increases that can materially adversely affect its business, results of operations and financial condition.The Company\u2019s new products often utilize custom components available from only one source. When a component or product uses new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers\u2019 yields have matured or their manufacturing capacities have increased. The continued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at all, can be affected for any number of reasons, including if suppliers decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the Company\u2019s requirements. When the Company\u2019s supply of components for a new or existing product has been delayed or constrained, or when an outsourcing partner has delayed shipments of completed products to the Company, the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition have been adversely affected and future delays or constraints could materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition. The Company\u2019s business and financial performance could also be materially adversely affected depending on the time required to obtain sufficient quantities from the source, or to identify and obtain sufficient quantities from an alternative source.The Company\u2019s products and services may be affected from time to time by design and manufacturing defects that could materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business and result in harm to the Company\u2019s reputation.The Company offers complex hardware and software products and services that can be affected by design and manufacturing defects. Sophisticated operating system software and applications, such as those offered by the Company, often have issues that can unexpectedly interfere with the intended operation of hardware or software products and services. Defects can also exist in components and products the Company purchases from third parties. Component defects could make the Company\u2019s products unsafe and create a risk of environmental or property damage and personal injury. These risks may increase as the Company\u2019s products are introduced into specialized applications, including health. In addition, the Company\u2019s service offerings can have quality issues and from time to time experience outages, service slowdowns or errors. As a result, from time to time the Company\u2019s services have not performed as anticipated and may not meet customer expectations. There can be no assurance the Company will be able to detect and fix all issues and defects in the hardware, software and services it offers. Failure to do so can result in widespread technical and performance issues affecting the Company\u2019s products and services. In addition, the Company can be exposed to product liability claims, recalls, product replacements or modifications, write-offs of inventory, property, plant and equipment or intangible assets, and significant warranty and other expenses, including litigation costs and regulatory fines. Quality problems can also adversely affect the experience for users of the Company\u2019s products and services, and result in harm to the Company\u2019s reputation, loss of competitive advantage, poor market acceptance, reduced demand for products and services, delay in new product and service introductions and lost sales.Apple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 8"}, "3": {"tables": {}, "text": "The Company is exposed to the risk of write-downs on the value of its inventory and other assets, in addition to purchase commitment cancellation risk.The Company records a write-down for product and component inventories that have become obsolete or exceed anticipated demand, or for which cost exceeds net realizable value. The Company also accrues necessary cancellation fee reserves for orders of excess products and components. The Company reviews long-lived assets, including capital assets held at its suppliers\u2019 facilities and inventory prepayments, for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate the assets may not be recoverable. If the Company determines that an impairment has occurred, it records a write-down equal to the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value. Although the Company believes its inventory, capital assets, inventory prepayments and other assets and purchase commitments are currently recoverable, there can be no assurance the Company will not incur write-downs, fees, impairments and other charges given the rapid and unpredictable pace of product obsolescence in the industries in which the Company competes.The Company orders components for its products and builds inventory in advance of product announcements and shipments. Manufacturing purchase obligations cover the Company\u2019s forecasted component and manufacturing requirements, typically for periods up to 150 days. Because the Company\u2019s markets are volatile, competitive and subject to rapid technology and price changes, there is a risk the Company will forecast incorrectly and order or produce excess or insufficient amounts of components or products, or not fully utilize firm purchase commitments.The Company relies on access to third-party intellectual property, which may not be available to the Company on commercially reasonable terms or at all.The Company\u2019s products and services are designed to include intellectual property owned by third parties, which requires licenses from those third parties. In addition, because of technological changes in the industries in which the Company currently competes or in the future may compete, current extensive patent coverage and the rapid rate of issuance of new patents, the Company\u2019s products and services can unknowingly infringe existing patents or intellectual property rights of others. From time to time, the Company has been notified that it may be infringing certain patents or other intellectual property rights of third parties. Based on experience and industry practice, the Company believes licenses to such third-party intellectual property can generally be obtained on commercially reasonable terms. However, there can be no assurance the necessary licenses can be obtained on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Failure to obtain the right to use third-party intellectual property, or to use such intellectual property on commercially reasonable terms, can preclude the Company from selling certain products or services, or otherwise have a material adverse impact on the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition.The Company\u2019s future performance depends in part on support from third-party software developers.The Company believes decisions by customers to purchase its hardware products depend in part on the availability of third-party software applications and services. There can be no assurance third-party developers will continue to develop and maintain software applications and services for the Company\u2019s products. If third-party software applications and services cease to be developed and maintained for the Company\u2019s products, customers may choose not to buy the Company\u2019s products.The Company believes the availability of third-party software applications and services for its products depends in part on the developers\u2019 perception and analysis of the relative benefits of developing, maintaining and upgrading such software and services for the Company\u2019s products compared to competitors\u2019 platforms, such as Android for smartphones and tablets, Windows for personal computers and tablets, and PlayStation, Nintendo and Xbox for gaming platforms. This analysis may be based on factors such as the market position of the Company and its products, the anticipated revenue that may be generated, expected future growth of product sales, and the costs of developing such applications and services.The Company\u2019s minority market share in the global smartphone, personal computer and tablet markets can make developers less inclined to develop or upgrade software for the Company\u2019s products and more inclined to devote their resources to developing and upgrading software for competitors\u2019 products with larger market share. When developers focus their efforts on these competing platforms, the availability and quality of applications for the Company\u2019s devices can suffer.The Company relies on the continued availability and development of compelling and innovative software applications for its products. The Company\u2019s products and operating systems are subject to rapid technological change, and when third-party developers are unable to or choose not to keep up with this pace of change, their applications can fail to take advantage of these changes to deliver improved customer experiences, can operate incorrectly, and can result in dissatisfied customers and lower customer demand for the Company\u2019s products.Apple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 9"}, "4": {"tables": {}, "text": "The Company distributes third-party applications for its products through the App Store. For the vast majority of applications, developers keep all of the revenue they generate on the App Store. The Company retains a commission from sales of applications and sales of digital services or goods initiated within an application. From time to time, the Company has made changes to its App Store, including actions taken in response to competition, market conditions and legal and regulatory requirements. The Company expects to make further business changes in the future, including as a result of legislative initiatives impacting the App Store, such as the European Union (\u201cEU\u201d) Digital Markets Act, which the Company is required to comply with by March 2024. The Company is also subject to litigation and investigations relating to the App Store, which have resulted in changes to the Company\u2019s business practices, and may in the future result in further changes. Changes have included how developers communicate with consumers outside the App Store regarding alternative purchasing mechanisms. Future changes could also affect what the Company charges developers for access to its platforms, how it manages distribution of apps outside of the App Store, and how and to what extent it allows developers to communicate with consumers inside the App Store regarding alternative purchasing mechanisms. This could reduce the volume of sales, and the commission that the Company earns on those sales, would decrease. If the rate of the commission that the Company retains on such sales is reduced, or if it is otherwise narrowed in scope or eliminated, the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.Failure to obtain or create digital content that appeals to the Company\u2019s customers, or to make such content available on commercially reasonable terms, could have a material adverse impact on the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition.The Company contracts with numerous third parties to offer their digital content to customers. This includes the right to sell, or offer subscriptions to, third-party content, as well as the right to incorporate specific content into the Company\u2019s own services. The licensing or other distribution arrangements for this content can be for relatively short time periods and do not guarantee the continuation or renewal of these arrangements on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Some third-party content providers and distributors currently or in the future may offer competing products and services, and can take actions to make it difficult or impossible for the Company to license or otherwise distribute their content. Other content owners, providers or distributors may seek to limit the Company\u2019s access to, or increase the cost of, such content. The Company may be unable to continue to offer a wide variety of content at commercially reasonable prices with acceptable usage rules.The Company also produces its own digital content, which can be costly to produce due to intense and increasing competition for talent, content and subscribers, and may fail to appeal to the Company\u2019s customers.Some third-party digital content providers require the Company to provide digital rights management and other security solutions. If requirements change, the Company may have to develop or license new technology to provide these solutions. There can be no assurance the Company will be able to develop or license such solutions at a reasonable cost and in a timely manner.The Company\u2019s success depends largely on the talents and efforts of its team members, the continued service and availability of highly skilled employees, including key personnel, and the Company\u2019s ability to nurture its distinctive and inclusive culture.Much of the Company\u2019s future success depends on the talents and efforts of its team members and the continued availability and service of key personnel, including its Chief Executive Officer, executive team and other highly skilled employees. Experienced personnel in the technology industry are in high demand and competition for their talents is intense, especially in Silicon Valley, where most of the Company\u2019s key personnel are located. In addition to intense competition for talent, workforce dynamics are constantly evolving. If the Company does not manage changing workforce dynamics effectively, it could materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s culture, reputation and operational flexibility.The Company believes that its distinctive and inclusive culture is a significant driver of its success. If the Company is unable to nurture its culture, it could materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s ability to recruit and retain the highly skilled employees who are critical to its success, and could otherwise materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.The Company depends on the performance of carriers, wholesalers, retailers and other resellers.The Company distributes its products and certain of its services through cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers and resellers, many of which distribute products and services from competitors. The Company also sells its products and services and resells third-party products in most of its major markets directly to consumers, small and mid-sized businesses, and education, enterprise and government customers through its retail and online stores and its direct sales force.Some carriers providing cellular network service for the Company\u2019s products offer financing, installment payment plans or subsidies for users\u2019 purchases of the device. There can be no assurance such offers will be continued at all or in the same amounts.Apple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 10"}, "5": {"tables": {}, "text": "The Company has invested and will continue to invest in programs to enhance reseller sales, including staffing selected resellers\u2019 stores with Company employees and contractors, and improving product placement displays. These programs can require a substantial investment while not assuring return or incremental sales. The financial condition of these resellers could weaken, these resellers could stop distributing the Company\u2019s products, or uncertainty regarding demand for some or all of the Company\u2019s products could cause resellers to reduce their ordering and marketing of the Company\u2019s products.The Company\u2019s business and reputation are impacted by information technology system failures and network disruptions.The Company and its global supply chain are dependent on complex information technology systems and are exposed to information technology system failures or network disruptions caused by natural disasters, accidents, power disruptions, telecommunications failures, acts of terrorism or war, computer viruses, physical or electronic break-ins, ransomware or other cybersecurity incidents, or other events or disruptions. System upgrades, redundancy and other continuity measures may be ineffective or inadequate, and the Company\u2019s or its vendors\u2019 business continuity and disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities. Such failures or disruptions can adversely impact the Company\u2019s business by, among other things, preventing access to the Company\u2019s online services, interfering with customer transactions or impeding the manufacturing and shipping of the Company\u2019s products. These events could materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.Losses or unauthorized access to or releases of confidential information, including personal information, could subject the Company to significant reputational, financial, legal and operational consequences.The Company\u2019s business requires it to use and store confidential information, including personal information, with respect to the Company\u2019s customers and employees. The Company devotes significant resources to network and data security, including through the use of encryption and other security measures intended to protect its systems and data. But these measures cannot provide absolute security, and losses or unauthorized access to or releases of confidential information occur and could materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.The Company\u2019s business also requires it to share confidential information with suppliers and other third parties. The Company relies on global suppliers that are also exposed to ransomware and other malicious attacks that can disrupt business operations. Although the Company takes steps to secure confidential information that is provided to or accessible by third parties working on the Company\u2019s behalf, such measures are not always effective and losses or unauthorized access to, or releases of, confidential information occur. Such incidents and other malicious attacks could materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.The Company experiences malicious attacks and other attempts to gain unauthorized access to its systems on a regular basis. These attacks seek to compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of confidential information or disrupt normal business operations, and can, among other things, impair the Company\u2019s ability to attract and retain customers for its products and services, impact the Company\u2019s stock price, materially damage commercial relationships, and expose the Company to litigation or government investigations, which could result in penalties, fines or judgments against the Company. Globally, attacks are expected to continue accelerating in both frequency and sophistication with increasing use by actors of tools and techniques that are designed to circumvent controls, avoid detection, and remove or obfuscate forensic evidence, all of which hinders the Company\u2019s ability to identify, investigate and recover from incidents. In addition, attacks against the Company and its customers can escalate during periods of severe diplomatic or armed conflict.Although malicious attacks perpetrated to gain access to confidential information, including personal information, affect many companies across various industries, the Company is at a relatively greater risk of being targeted because of its high profile and the value of the confidential information it creates, owns, manages, stores and processes.The Company has implemented systems and processes intended to secure its information technology systems and prevent unauthorized access to or loss of sensitive data, and mitigate the impact of unauthorized access, including through the use of encryption and authentication technologies. As with all companies, these security measures may not be sufficient for all eventualities and may be vulnerable to hacking, ransomware attacks, employee error, malfeasance, system error, faulty password management or other irregularities. For example, third parties can fraudulently induce the Company\u2019s or its vendors\u2019 employees or customers into disclosing usernames, passwords or other sensitive information, which can, in turn, be used for unauthorized access to the Company\u2019s or its vendors\u2019 systems and services. To help protect customers and the Company, the Company deploys and makes available technologies like multifactor authentication, monitors its services and systems for unusual activity and may freeze accounts under suspicious circumstances, which, among other things, can result in the delay or loss of customer orders or impede customer access to the Company\u2019s products and services.While the Company maintains insurance coverage that is intended to address certain aspects of data security risks, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise.Apple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 11"}, "6": {"tables": {}, "text": "Investment in new business strategies and acquisitions could disrupt the Company\u2019s ongoing business, present risks not originally contemplated and materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.The Company has invested, and in the future may invest, in new business strategies or acquisitions. Such endeavors may involve significant risks and uncertainties, including distraction of management from current operations, greater-than-expected liabilities and expenses, economic, political, legal and regulatory challenges associated with operating in new businesses, regions or countries, inadequate return on capital, potential impairment of tangible and intangible assets, and significant write-offs. Investment and acquisition transactions are exposed to additional risks, including failing to obtain required regulatory approvals on a timely basis or at all, or the imposition of onerous conditions that could delay or prevent the Company from completing a transaction or otherwise limit the Company\u2019s ability to fully realize the anticipated benefits of a transaction. These new ventures are inherently risky and may not be successful. The failure of any significant investment could materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.The Company\u2019s retail stores are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties.The Company\u2019s retail operations are subject to many factors that pose risks and uncertainties and could adversely impact the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition, including macroeconomic factors that could have an adverse effect on general retail activity. Other factors include the Company\u2019s ability to: manage costs associated with retail store construction and operation; manage relationships with existing retail partners; manage costs associated with fluctuations in the value of retail inventory; and obtain and renew leases in quality retail locations at a reasonable cost.Legal and Regulatory Compliance RisksThe Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely impacted by unfavorable results of legal proceedings or government investigations.The Company is subject to various claims, legal proceedings and government investigations that have arisen in the ordinary course of business and have not yet been fully resolved, and new matters may arise in the future. In addition, agreements entered into by the Company sometimes include indemnification provisions which can subject the Company to costs and damages in the event of a claim against an indemnified third party. The number of claims, legal proceedings and government investigations involving the Company, and the alleged magnitude of such claims, proceedings and government investigations, has generally increased over time and may continue to increase.The Company has faced and continues to face a significant number of patent claims relating to its cellular-enabled products, and new claims may arise in the future, including as a result of new legal or regulatory frameworks. For example, technology and other patent-holding companies frequently assert their patents and seek royalties and often enter into litigation based on allegations of patent infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. The Company is vigorously defending infringement actions in courts in several U.S. jurisdictions, as well as internationally in various countries. The plaintiffs in these actions frequently seek injunctions and substantial damages.Regardless of the merit of particular claims, defending against litigation or responding to government investigations can be expensive, time-consuming and disruptive to the Company\u2019s operations. In recognition of these considerations, the Company may enter into agreements or other arrangements to settle litigation and resolve such challenges. There can be no assurance such agreements can be obtained on acceptable terms or that litigation will not occur. These agreements can also significantly increase the Company\u2019s cost of sales and operating expenses and require the Company to change its business practices and limit the Company\u2019s ability to offer certain products and services.Except as described in Part I, Item 3 of this Form 10-K under the heading \u201cLegal Proceedings\u201d and in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Note 12, \u201cCommitments, Contingencies and Supply Concentrations\u201d under the heading \u201cContingencies,\u201d in the opinion of management, there was not at least a reasonable possibility the Company may have incurred a material loss, or a material loss greater than a recorded accrual, concerning loss contingencies for asserted legal and other claims.The outcome of litigation or government investigations is inherently uncertain. If one or more legal matters were resolved against the Company or an indemnified third party in a reporting period for amounts above management\u2019s expectations, the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial condition for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected. Further, such an outcome can result in significant compensatory, punitive or trebled monetary damages, disgorgement of revenue or profits, remedial corporate measures or injunctive relief against the Company, and has from time to time required, and can in the future require, the Company to change its business practices and limit the Company\u2019s ability to offer certain products and services, all of which could materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.While the Company maintains insurance coverage for certain types of claims, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise.Apple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 12"}, "7": {"tables": {}, "text": "The Company is subject to complex and changing laws and regulations worldwide, which exposes the Company to potential liabilities, increased costs and other adverse effects on the Company\u2019s business.The Company\u2019s global operations are subject to complex and changing laws and regulations on subjects, including antitrust; privacy, data security and data localization; consumer protection; advertising, sales, billing and e-commerce; financial services and technology; product liability; intellectual property ownership and infringement; digital platforms; machine learning and artificial intelligence; internet, telecommunications and mobile communications; media, television, film and digital content; availability of third-party software applications and services; labor and employment; anticorruption; import, export and trade; foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions; anti\u2013money laundering; foreign ownership and investment; tax; and environmental, health and safety, including electronic waste, recycling, product design and climate change.Compliance with these laws and regulations is onerous and expensive. New and changing laws and regulations can adversely affect the Company\u2019s business by increasing the Company\u2019s costs, limiting the Company\u2019s ability to offer a product, service or feature to customers, imposing changes to the design of the Company\u2019s products and services, impacting customer demand for the Company\u2019s products and services, and requiring changes to the Company\u2019s supply chain and its business. New and changing laws and regulations can also create uncertainty about how such laws and regulations will be interpreted and applied. These risks and costs may increase as the Company\u2019s products and services are introduced into specialized applications, including health and financial services. The Company has implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations, but there can be no assurance the Company\u2019s employees, contractors or agents will not violate such laws and regulations or the Company\u2019s policies and procedures. If the Company is found to have violated laws and regulations, it could materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition. Regulatory changes and other actions that materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business may be announced with little or no advance notice and the Company may not be able to effectively mitigate all adverse impacts from such measures. For example, the Company is subject to changing regulations relating to the export and import of its products. Although the Company has programs, policies and procedures in place that are designed to satisfy regulatory requirements, there can be no assurance that such policies and procedures will be effective in preventing a violation or a claim of a violation. As a result, the Company\u2019s products could be banned, delayed or prohibited from importation, which could materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.Expectations relating to environmental, social and governance considerations and related reporting obligations expose the Company to potential liabilities, increased costs, reputational harm, and other adverse effects on the Company\u2019s business.Many governments, regulators, investors, employees, customers and other stakeholders are increasingly focused on environmental, social and governance considerations relating to businesses, including climate change and greenhouse gas emissions, human and civil rights, and diversity, equity and inclusion. In addition, the Company makes statements about its goals and initiatives through its various non-financial reports, information provided on its website, press statements and other communications. Responding to these environmental, social and governance considerations and implementation of these goals and initiatives involves risks and uncertainties, requires investments, and depends in part on third-party performance or data that is outside the Company\u2019s control. The Company cannot guarantee that it will achieve its announced environmental, social and governance goals and initiatives. In addition, some stakeholders may disagree with the Company\u2019s goals and initiatives. Any failure, or perceived failure, by the Company to achieve its goals, further its initiatives, adhere to its public statements, comply with federal, state or international environmental, social and governance laws and regulations, or meet evolving and varied stakeholder expectations and standards could result in legal and regulatory proceedings against the Company and materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and stock price.The technology industry, including, in some instances, the Company, is subject to intense media, political and regulatory scrutiny, which exposes the Company to increasing regulation, government investigations, legal actions and penalties.From time to time, the Company has made changes to its App Store, including actions taken in response to litigation, competition, market conditions and legal and regulatory requirements. The Company expects to make further business changes in the future, including as a result of legislative initiatives impacting the App Store, such as the EU Digital Markets Act, which the Company is required to comply with by March 2024, or similar laws in other jurisdictions. Changes have included how developers communicate with consumers outside the App Store regarding alternative purchasing mechanisms. Future changes could also affect what the Company charges developers for access to its platforms, how it manages distribution of apps outside of the App Store, and how and to what extent it allows developers to communicate with consumers inside the App Store regarding alternative purchasing mechanisms.Apple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 13"}, "8": {"tables": {}, "text": "The Company is also currently subject to antitrust investigations in various jurisdictions around the world, which can result in legal proceedings and claims against the Company that could, individually or in the aggregate, have a materially adverse impact on the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition. For example, the Company is the subject of investigations in Europe and other jurisdictions relating to App Store terms and conditions. If such investigations result in adverse findings against the Company, the Company could be exposed to significant fines and may be required to make changes to its App Store business, all of which could materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition. The Company is also subject to litigation relating to the App Store, which has resulted in changes to the Company\u2019s business practices, and may in the future result in further changes.Further, the Company has commercial relationships with other companies in the technology industry that are or may become subject to investigations and litigation that, if resolved against those other companies, could materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s commercial relationships with those business partners and materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition. For example, the Company earns revenue from licensing arrangements with other companies to offer their search services on the Company\u2019s platforms and applications, and certain of these arrangements are currently subject to government investigations and legal proceedings.There can be no assurance the Company\u2019s business will not be materially adversely affected, individually or in the aggregate, by the outcomes of such investigations, litigation or changes to laws and regulations in the future. Changes to the Company\u2019s business practices to comply with new laws and regulations or in connection with other legal proceedings could negatively impact the reputation of the Company\u2019s products for privacy and security and otherwise adversely affect the experience for users of the Company\u2019s products and services, and result in harm to the Company\u2019s reputation, loss of competitive advantage, poor market acceptance, reduced demand for products and services, and lost sales.The Company\u2019s business is subject to a variety of U.S. and international laws, rules, policies and other obligations regarding data protection.The Company is subject to an increasing number of federal, state and international laws relating to the collection, use, retention, security and transfer of various types of personal information. In many cases, these laws apply not only to third-party transactions, but also restrict transfers of personal information among the Company and its international subsidiaries. Several jurisdictions have passed laws in this area, and additional jurisdictions are considering imposing additional restrictions or have laws that are pending. These laws continue to develop and may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Complying with emerging and changing requirements causes the Company to incur substantial costs and has required and may in the future require the Company to change its business practices. Noncompliance could result in significant penalties or legal liability.The Company makes statements about its use and disclosure of personal information through its privacy policy, information provided on its website, press statements and other privacy notices provided to customers. Any failure by the Company to comply with these public statements or with other federal, state or international privacy or data protection laws and regulations could result in inquiries or proceedings against the Company by governmental entities or others. In addition to reputational impacts, penalties could include ongoing audit requirements and significant legal liability.In addition to the risks generally relating to the collection, use, retention, security and transfer of personal information, the Company is also subject to specific obligations relating to information considered sensitive under applicable laws, such as health data, financial data and biometric data. Health data and financial data are subject to additional privacy, security and breach notification requirements, and the Company is subject to audit by governmental authorities regarding the Company\u2019s compliance with these obligations. If the Company fails to adequately comply with these rules and requirements, or if health data or financial data is handled in a manner not permitted by law or under the Company\u2019s agreements with healthcare or financial institutions, the Company can be subject to litigation or government investigations, and can be liable for associated investigatory expenses, and can also incur significant fees or fines.Payment card data is also subject to additional requirements. Under payment card rules and obligations, if cardholder information is potentially compromised, the Company can be liable for associated investigatory expenses and can also incur significant fees or fines if the Company fails to follow payment card industry data security standards. The Company could also experience a significant increase in payment card transaction costs or lose the ability to process payment cards if it fails to follow payment card industry data security standards, which could materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.Apple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 14"}, "9": {"tables": {}, "text": "Financial RisksThe Company expects its quarterly net sales and results of operations to fluctuate.The Company\u2019s profit margins vary across its products, services, geographic segments and distribution channels. For example, the gross margins on the Company\u2019s products and services vary significantly and can change over time. The Company\u2019s gross margins are subject to volatility and downward pressure due to a variety of factors, including: continued industry-wide global product pricing pressures and product pricing actions that the Company may take in response to such pressures; increased competition; the Company\u2019s ability to effectively stimulate demand for certain of its products and services; compressed product life cycles; supply shortages; potential increases in the cost of components, outside manufacturing services, and developing, acquiring and delivering content for the Company\u2019s services; the Company\u2019s ability to manage product quality and warranty costs effectively; shifts in the mix of products and services, or in the geographic, currency or channel mix, including to the extent that regulatory changes require the Company to modify its product and service offerings; fluctuations in foreign exchange rates; inflation and other macroeconomic pressures; and the introduction of new products or services, including new products or services with higher cost structures. These and other factors could have a materially adverse impact on the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial condition.The Company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its fiscal year due in part to seasonal holiday demand. Additionally, new product and service introductions can significantly impact net sales, cost of sales and operating expenses. Further, the Company generates a significant portion of its net sales from a single product and a decline in demand for that product could significantly impact quarterly net sales. The Company could also be subject to unexpected developments, such as lower-than-anticipated demand for the Company\u2019s products or services, issues with new product or service introductions, information technology system failures or network disruptions, or failure of one of the Company\u2019s logistics, components supply, or manufacturing partners.The Company\u2019s financial performance is subject to risks associated with changes in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to local currencies.The Company\u2019s primary exposure to movements in foreign exchange rates relates to non\u2013U.S. dollar\u2013denominated sales, cost of sales and operating expenses worldwide. Gross margins on the Company\u2019s products in foreign countries and on products that include components obtained from foreign suppliers have in the past been adversely affected and could in the future be materially adversely affected by foreign exchange rate fluctuations.The weakening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar adversely affects the U.S. dollar value of the Company\u2019s foreign currency\u2013denominated sales and earnings, and generally leads the Company to raise international pricing, potentially reducing demand for the Company\u2019s products. In some circumstances, for competitive or other reasons, the Company may decide not to raise international pricing to offset the U.S. dollar\u2019s strengthening, which would adversely affect the U.S. dollar value of the gross margins the Company earns on foreign currency\u2013denominated sales.Conversely, a strengthening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, while generally beneficial to the Company\u2019s foreign currency\u2013denominated sales and earnings, could cause the Company to reduce international pricing or incur losses on its foreign currency derivative instruments, thereby limiting the benefit. Additionally, strengthening of foreign currencies may increase the Company\u2019s cost of product components denominated in those currencies, thus adversely affecting gross margins.The Company uses derivative instruments, such as foreign currency forward and option contracts, to hedge certain exposures to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. The use of such hedging activities may not be effective to offset any, or more than a portion, of the adverse financial effects of unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates over the limited time the hedges are in place.The Company is exposed to credit risk and fluctuations in the values of its investment portfolio.The Company\u2019s investments can be negatively affected by changes in liquidity, credit deterioration, financial results, market and economic conditions, political risk, sovereign risk, interest rate fluctuations or other factors. As a result, the value and liquidity of the Company\u2019s cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities may fluctuate substantially. Therefore, although the Company has not realized any significant losses on its cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, future fluctuations in their value could result in significant losses and could have a material adverse impact on the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial condition.Apple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 15"}, "10": {"tables": {}, "text": "The Company is exposed to credit risk on its trade accounts receivable, vendor non-trade receivables and prepayments related to long-term supply agreements, and this risk is heightened during periods when economic conditions worsen.The Company distributes its products and certain of its services through third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers and resellers. The Company also sells its products and services directly to small and mid-sized businesses and education, enterprise and government customers. A substantial majority of the Company\u2019s outstanding trade receivables are not covered by collateral, third-party bank support or financing arrangements, or credit insurance, and a significant portion of the Company\u2019s trade receivables can be concentrated within cellular network carriers or other resellers. The Company\u2019s exposure to credit and collectibility risk on its trade receivables is higher in certain international markets and its ability to mitigate such risks may be limited. The Company also has unsecured vendor non-trade receivables resulting from purchases of components by outsourcing partners and other vendors that manufacture subassemblies or assemble final products for the Company. In addition, the Company has made prepayments associated with long-term supply agreements to secure supply of inventory components. As of September\u00a030, 2023, the Company\u2019s vendor non-trade receivables and prepayments related to long-term supply agreements were concentrated among a few individual vendors located primarily in Asia. While the Company has procedures to monitor and limit exposure to credit risk on its trade and vendor non-trade receivables, as well as long-term prepayments, there can be no assurance such procedures will effectively limit its credit risk and avoid losses.The Company is subject to changes in tax rates, the adoption of new U.S. or international tax legislation and exposure to additional tax liabilities.The Company is subject to taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions, including Ireland and Singapore, where a number of the Company\u2019s subsidiaries are organized. Due to economic and political conditions, tax laws and tax rates for income taxes and other non-income taxes in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change. For example, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development continues to advance proposals for modernizing international tax rules, including the introduction of global minimum tax standards. The Company\u2019s effective tax rates are affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, the introduction of new taxes, and changes in tax laws or their interpretation. The application of tax laws may be uncertain, require significant judgment and be subject to differing interpretations.The Company is also subject to the examination of its tax returns and other tax matters by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities and governmental bodies. The Company regularly assesses the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of its provision for taxes. There can be no assurance as to the outcome of these examinations. If the Company\u2019s effective tax rates were to increase, or if the ultimate determination of the Company\u2019s taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued, the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.General RisksThe price of the Company\u2019s stock is subject to volatility.The Company\u2019s stock has experienced substantial price volatility in the past and may continue to do so in the future. Additionally, the Company, the technology industry and the stock market as a whole have, from time to time, experienced extreme stock price and volume fluctuations that have affected stock prices in ways that may have been unrelated to these companies\u2019 operating performance. Price volatility may cause the average price at which the Company repurchases its stock in a given period to exceed the stock\u2019s price at a given point in time. The Company believes the price of its stock should reflect expectations of future growth and profitability. The Company also believes the price of its stock should reflect expectations that its cash dividend will continue at current levels or grow, and that its current share repurchase program will be fully consummated. Future dividends are subject to declaration by the Company\u2019s Board of Directors, and the Company\u2019s share repurchase program does not obligate it to acquire any specific number of shares. If the Company fails to meet expectations related to future growth, profitability, dividends, share repurchases or other market expectations, the price of the Company\u2019s stock may decline significantly, which could have a material adverse impact on investor confidence and employee retention.Item 1B.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Unresolved Staff CommentsNone.Item 1C.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0CybersecurityNot applicable.Apple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 16"}}, "Item 6": null, "Item 7": {"0": {"tables": {"0": [["2023", "Change", "2022", "Change", "2021"], ["Americas", "162560", "4", "%", "169658", "11", "%", "153306"], ["Europe", "94294", "1", "%", "95118", "7", "%", "89307"], ["Greater China", "72559", "2", "%", "74200", "9", "%", "68366"], ["Japan", "24257", "7", "%", "25977", "9", "%", "28482"], ["Rest of Asia Pacific", "29615", "1", "%", "29375", "11", "%", "26356"], ["Total net sales", "383285", "3", "%", "394328", "8", "%", "365817"]]}, "text": "Segment Operating PerformanceThe following table shows net sales by reportable segment for 2023, 2022 and 2021 (dollars in millions):AmericasAmericas net sales decreased 4% or $7.1 billion during 2023 compared to 2022 due to lower net sales of iPhone and Mac, partially offset by higher net sales of Services.EuropeEurope net sales decreased 1% or $824 million during 2023 compared to 2022.

The program does not obligate the Company to acquire a minimum amount of shares. As of September\u00a030, 2023, the Company\u2019s quarterly cash dividend was $0.24 per share. The Company intends to increase its dividend on an annual basis, subject to declaration by the Board of Directors.Critical Accounting EstimatesThe preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\u201cGAAP\u201d) and the Company\u2019s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and operating results require the Company\u2019s management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported. Note 1, \u201cSummary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities.Uncertain Tax PositionsThe Company is subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. The evaluation of the Company\u2019s uncertain tax positions involves significant judgment in the interpretation and application of GAAP and complex domestic and international tax laws, including the Act and matters related to the allocation of international taxation rights between countries. Although management believes the Company\u2019s reserves are reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final outcome of these uncertainties will not be different from that which is reflected in the Company\u2019s reserves. Reserves are adjusted considering changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax examination. Resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with management\u2019s expectations could have a material impact on the Company\u2019s financial condition and operating results.Legal and Other ContingenciesThe Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business, the outcomes of which are inherently uncertain. The Company records a liability when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable, the determination of which requires significant judgment. Resolution of legal matters in a manner inconsistent with management\u2019s expectations could have a material impact on the Company\u2019s financial condition and operating results.Apple Inc. | 2023

The preparation of these consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in conformity with GAAP requires the use of management estimates. Certain prior period amounts in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been reclassified to conform to the current period\u2019s presentation.The Company\u2019s fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week period that ends on the last Saturday of September. An additional week is included in the first fiscal quarter every five or six years to realign the Company\u2019s fiscal quarters with calendar quarters, which occurred in the first fiscal quarter of 2023. The Company\u2019s fiscal year 2023 spanned 53 weeks, whereas fiscal years 2022 and 2021 spanned 52 weeks each. Unless otherwise stated, references to particular years, quarters, months and periods refer to the Company\u2019s fiscal years ended in September and the associated quarters, months and periods of those fiscal years.RevenueThe Company records revenue net of taxes collected from customers that are remitted to governmental authorities.Share-Based CompensationThe Company recognizes share-based compensation expense on a straight-line basis for its estimate of equity awards that will ultimately vest.Cash EquivalentsAll highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase are treated as cash equivalents.Marketable SecuritiesThe cost of securities sold is determined using the specific identification method.InventoriesInventories are measured using the first-in, first-out method.Property, Plant and EquipmentDepreciation on property, plant and equipment is recognized on a straight-line basis.Derivative InstrumentsThe Company presents derivative assets and liabilities at their gross fair values in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.Income TaxesThe Company records certain deferred tax assets and liabilities in connection with the minimum tax on certain foreign earnings created by the Act.LeasesThe Company combines and accounts for lease and nonlease components as a single lease component for leases of corporate, data center and retail facilities.Apple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 33"}, "6": {"tables": {}, "text": "Note 2 \u2013 RevenueThe Company recognizes revenue at the amount to which it expects to be entitled when control of the products or services is transferred to its customers. Control is generally transferred when the Company has a present right to payment and title and the significant risks and rewards of ownership of products or services are transferred to its customers. For most of the Company\u2019s Products net sales, control transfers when products are shipped. For the Company\u2019s Services net sales, control transfers over time as services are delivered. Payment for Products and Services net sales is collected within a short period following transfer of control or commencement of delivery of services, as applicable.The Company records reductions to Products net sales related to future product returns, price protection and other customer incentive programs based on the Company\u2019s expectations and historical experience.For arrangements with multiple performance obligations, which represent promises within an arrangement that are distinct, the Company allocates revenue to all distinct performance obligations based on their relative stand-alone selling prices (\u201cSSPs\u201d). When available, the Company uses observable prices to determine SSPs. When observable prices are not available, SSPs are established that reflect the Company\u2019s best estimates of what the selling prices of the performance obligations would be if they were sold regularly on a stand-alone basis. The Company\u2019s process for estimating SSPs without observable prices considers multiple factors that may vary depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each performance obligation including, where applicable, prices charged by the Company for similar offerings, market trends in the pricing for similar offerings, product-specific business objectives and the estimated cost to provide the performance obligation.The Company has identified up to three performance obligations regularly included in arrangements involving the sale of iPhone, Mac, iPad and certain other products. The first performance obligation, which represents the substantial portion of the allocated sales price, is the hardware and bundled software delivered at the time of sale. The second performance obligation is the right to receive certain product-related bundled services, which include iCloud\u00ae, Siri\u00ae and Maps. The third performance obligation is the right to receive, on a when-and-if-available basis, future unspecified software upgrades relating to the software bundled with each device. The Company allocates revenue and any related discounts to these performance obligations based on their relative SSPs. Because the Company lacks observable prices for the undelivered performance obligations, the allocation of revenue is based on the Company\u2019s estimated SSPs. Revenue allocated to the delivered hardware and bundled software is recognized when control has transferred to the customer, which generally occurs when the product is shipped. Revenue allocated to the product-related bundled services and unspecified software upgrade rights is deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis over the estimated period they are expected to be provided.For certain long-term service arrangements, the Company has performance obligations for services it has not yet delivered. For these arrangements, the Company does not have a right to bill for the undelivered services. The Company has determined that any unbilled consideration relates entirely to the value of the undelivered services. Accordingly, the Company has not recognized revenue, and does not disclose amounts, related to these undelivered services.For the sale of third-party products where the Company obtains control of the product before transferring it to the customer, the Company recognizes revenue based on the gross amount billed to customers. The Company considers multiple factors when determining whether it obtains control of third-party products, including evaluating if it can establish the price of the product, retains inventory risk for tangible products or has the responsibility for ensuring acceptability of the product. For third-party applications sold through the App Store, the Company does not obtain control of the product before transferring it to the customer. Therefore, the Company accounts for all third-party application\u2013related sales on a net basis by recognizing in Services net sales only the commission it retains.Apple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 34"}, "7": {"tables": {"0": [["Item", "2023", "2022", "2021"], ["iPhone 1", "200583", "205489", "191973"], ["Mac 1", "29357", "40177", "35190"], ["iPad 1", "28300", "29292", "31862"], ["Wearables Home and Accessories 1", "39845", "41241", "38367"], ["Services 2", "85200", "78129", "68425"], ["Total net sales", "383285", "394328", "365817"]], "1": [["2023", "2022", "2021", "Numerator"], ["Net income", "96995", "99803", "94680"], ["Weighted-average basic shares outstanding", "15744231", "16215963", "16701272"], ["Effect of dilutive share-based awards", "68316", "109856", "163647"], ["Weighted-average diluted shares", "15812547", "16325819", "16864919"], ["Basic earnings per share", "6.16", "6.15", "5.67"], ["Diluted earnings per share", "6.13", "6.11", "5.61"]]}, "text": "Net sales disaggregated by significant products and services for 2023, 2022 and 2021 were as follows (in millions):(1)Products net sales include amortization of the deferred value of unspecified software upgrade rights, which are bundled in the sales price of the respective product.(2)Services net sales include amortization of the deferred value of services bundled in the sales price of certain products.Total net sales include $8.2 billion of revenue recognized in 2023 that was included in deferred revenue as of September\u00a024, 2022, $7.5 billion of revenue recognized in 2022 that was included in deferred revenue as of September\u00a025, 2021, and $6.7 billion of revenue recognized in 2021 that was included in deferred revenue as of September\u00a026, 2020.The Company\u2019s proportion of net sales by disaggregated revenue source was generally consistent for each reportable segment in Note 13, \u201cSegment Information and Geographic Data\u201d for 2023, 2022 and 2021, except in Greater China, where iPhone revenue represented a moderately higher proportion of net sales.As of September\u00a030, 2023 and September\u00a024, 2022, the Company had total deferred revenue of $12.1 billion and $12.4\u00a0billion, respectively.

There can be no assurance the hedges will offset more than a portion of the financial impact resulting from movements in foreign exchange or interest rates.The Company classifies cash flows related to derivative instruments in the same section of the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows as the items being hedged, which are generally classified as operating activities.Foreign Exchange Rate RiskTo protect gross margins from fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, the Company may use forwards, options or other instruments, and may designate these instruments as cash flow hedges. The Company generally hedges portions of its forecasted foreign currency exposure associated with revenue and inventory purchases, typically for up to 12 months.To protect the Company\u2019s foreign currency\u2013denominated term debt or marketable securities from fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, the Company may use forwards, cross-currency swaps or other instruments. The Company designates these instruments as either cash flow or fair value hedges. As of September\u00a030, 2023, the maximum length of time over which the Company is hedging its exposure to the variability in future cash flows for term debt\u2013related foreign currency transactions is 19 years.The Company may also use derivative instruments that are not designated as accounting hedges to protect gross margins from certain fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, as well as to offset a portion of the foreign currency gains and losses generated by the remeasurement of certain assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies.Interest Rate RiskTo protect the Company\u2019s term debt or marketable securities from fluctuations in interest rates, the Company may use interest rate swaps, options or other instruments. The Company designates these instruments as either cash flow or fair value hedges.The notional amounts of the Company\u2019s outstanding derivative instruments as of September\u00a030, 2023 and September\u00a024, 2022 were as follows (in millions):Apple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 37"}, "10": {"tables": {"0": [["Fair Value ofDerivatives Designatedas Accounting Hedges", "Fair Value ofDerivatives Not Designatedas Accounting Hedges", "TotalFair Value"], ["Foreign exchange contracts", "4317", "2819", "7136"], ["Foreign exchange contracts", "2205", "2547", "4752"], ["Interest rate contracts", "1367", "1367"]], "1": [["2023", "2022", "Hedged assetsliabilities"], ["Current and non-current marketable securities", "14433", "13378"], ["Current and non-current term debt", "18247", "18739"]]}, "text": "The gross fair values of the Company\u2019s derivative assets and liabilities as of September\u00a024, 2022 were as follows (in millions):(1)Derivative assets are measured using Level 2 fair value inputs and are included in other current assets and other non-current assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.(2)Derivative liabilities are measured using Level 2 fair value inputs and are included in other current liabilities and other non-current liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.The derivative assets above represent the Company\u2019s gross credit exposure if all counterparties failed to perform. To mitigate credit risk, the Company generally uses collateral security arrangements that provide for collateral to be received or posted when the net fair values of certain derivatives fluctuate from contractually established thresholds. To further limit credit risk, the Company generally uses master netting arrangements with the respective counterparties to the Company\u2019s derivative contracts, under which the Company is allowed to settle transactions with a single net amount payable by one party to the other. As of September\u00a024, 2022, the potential effects of these rights of set-off associated with the Company\u2019s derivative contracts, including the effects of collateral, would be a reduction to both derivative assets and derivative liabilities of $7.8 billion, resulting in a net derivative asset of $412 million.The carrying amounts of the Company\u2019s hedged items in fair value hedges as of September\u00a030, 2023 and September\u00a024, 2022 were as follows (in millions):Accounts ReceivableTrade ReceivablesAs of September 24, 2022, the Company had one customer that represented 10% or more of total trade receivables, which accounted for 10%.

The Company requires third-party credit support or collateral from certain customers to limit credit risk.Vendor Non-Trade ReceivablesThe Company has non-trade receivables from certain of its manufacturing vendors resulting from the sale of components to these vendors who manufacture subassemblies or assemble final products for the Company. The Company purchases these components directly from suppliers. The Company does not reflect the sale of these components in products net sales. Rather, the Company recognizes any gain on these sales as a reduction of products cost of sales when the related final products are sold by the Company. As of September\u00a030, 2023, the Company had two vendors that individually represented 10% or more of total vendor non-trade receivables, which accounted for 48% and 23%.

The State Aid Decision ordered Ireland to calculate and recover additional taxes from the Company for the period June 2003 through December 2014. Irish legislative changes, effective as of January 2015, eliminated the application of the tax opinions from that date forward. The recovery amount was calculated to be \u20ac13.1 billion, plus interest of \u20ac1.2 billion. The Company and Ireland appealed the State Aid Decision to the General Court of the Court of Justice of the European Union (the \u201cGeneral Court\u201d). On July 15, 2020, the General Court annulled the State Aid Decision. On September 25, 2020, the European Commission appealed the General Court\u2019s decision to the European Court of Justice (the \u201cECJ\u201d) and a hearing was held on May 23, 2023. A decision from the ECJ is expected in calendar year 2024. The Company believes it would be eligible to claim a U.S. foreign tax credit for a portion of any incremental Irish corporate income taxes potentially due related to the State Aid Decision.On an annual basis, the Company may request approval from the Irish Minister for Finance to reduce the recovery amount for certain taxes paid to other countries. As of September\u00a030, 2023, the adjusted recovery amount was \u20ac12.7 billion, excluding interest.

RSUs granted under the 2022 Plan generally vest over four years, based on continued employment, and are settled upon vesting in shares of the Company\u2019s common stock on a one-for-one basis. All RSUs granted under the 2022 Plan have dividend equivalent rights, which entitle holders of RSUs to the same dividend value per share as holders of common stock.

Total payments to taxing authorities for employees\u2019 tax obligations were $5.6 billion, $6.4 billion and $6.8 billion in 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.Apple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 45"}, "18": {"tables": {"0": [["Item", "2023", "2022", "2021"], ["Share-based compensation expense", "10833", "9038", "7906"], ["Income tax benefit related to share-based compensation expense", "3421", "4002", "4056"]], "1": [["2024", "4258"], ["2025", "2674"], ["2026", "3434"], ["2027", "1277"], ["2028", "5878"], ["Thereafter", "3215"], ["Total", "20736"]]}, "text": "Share-Based CompensationThe following table shows share-based compensation expense and the related income tax benefit included in the Consolidated Statements of Operations for 2023, 2022 and 2021 (in millions):As of September\u00a030, 2023, the total unrecognized compensation cost related to outstanding RSUs was $18.6 billion, which the Company expects to recognize over a weighted-average period of 2.5 years.Note 12 \u2013 Commitments, Contingencies and Supply ConcentrationsUnconditional Purchase ObligationsThe Company has entered into certain off\u2013balance sheet commitments that require the future purchase of goods or services (\u201cunconditional purchase obligations\u201d). The Company\u2019s unconditional purchase obligations primarily consist of supplier arrangements, licensed intellectual property and content, and distribution rights. Future payments under noncancelable unconditional purchase obligations with a remaining term in excess of one year as of September\u00a030, 2023, are as follows (in millions):ContingenciesThe Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that have arisen in the ordinary course of business and that have not been fully resolved. The outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain. In the opinion of management, there was not at least a reasonable possibility the Company may have incurred a material loss, or a material loss greater than a recorded accrual, concerning loss contingencies for asserted legal and other claims.Concentrations in the Available Sources of Supply of Materials and ProductAlthough most components essential to the Company\u2019s business are generally available from multiple sources, certain components are currently obtained from single or limited sources. The Company also competes for various components with other participants in the markets for smartphones, personal computers, tablets, wearables and accessories. Therefore, many components used by the Company, including those that are available from multiple sources, are at times subject to industry-wide shortage and significant commodity pricing fluctuations.The Company uses some custom components that are not commonly used by its competitors, and new products introduced by the Company often utilize custom components available from only one source. When a component or product uses new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers\u2019 yields have matured or their manufacturing capacities have increased. The continued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at all, may be affected if suppliers decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the Company\u2019s requirements.Substantially all of the Company\u2019s hardware products are manufactured by outsourcing partners that are located primarily in China mainland, India, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Vietnam.Apple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 46"}, "19": {"tables": {"0": [["2023", "2022", "2021", "Americas"], ["Net sales", "162560", "169658", "153306"], ["Operating income", "60508", "62683", "53382"], ["Net sales", "94294", "95118", "89307"], ["Operating income", "36098", "35233", "32505"], ["Net sales", "72559", "74200", "68366"], ["Operating income", "30328", "31153", "28504"], ["Net sales", "24257", "25977", "28482"], ["Operating income", "11888", "12257", "12798"], ["Net sales", "29615", "29375", "26356"], ["Operating income", "12066", "11569", "9817"]], "1": [["Item", "2023", "2022", "2021"], ["Segment operating income", "150888", "152895", "137006"], ["Research and development expense", "29915", "26251", "21914"], ["Other corporate expenses net 1", "6672", "7207", "6143"], ["Total operating income", "114301", "119437", "108949"]]}, "text": "Note 13 \u2013 Segment Information and Geographic DataThe Company manages its business primarily on a geographic basis. The Company\u2019s reportable segments consist of the Americas, Europe, Greater China, Japan and Rest of Asia Pacific. Americas includes both North and South America. Europe includes European countries, as well as India, the Middle East and Africa. Greater China includes China mainland, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Rest of Asia Pacific includes Australia and those Asian countries not included in the Company\u2019s other reportable segments. Although the reportable segments provide similar hardware and software products and similar services, each one is managed separately to better align with the location of the Company\u2019s customers and distribution partners and the unique market dynamics of each geographic region.The Company evaluates the performance of its reportable segments based on net sales and operating income. Net sales for geographic segments are generally based on the location of customers and sales through the Company\u2019s retail stores located in those geographic locations. Operating income for each segment consists of net sales to third parties, related cost of sales, and operating expenses directly attributable to the segment.

A company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1)\u00a0pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2)\u00a0provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3)\u00a0provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company\u2019s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate./s/ Ernst & Young LLPSan Jose, CaliforniaNovember\u00a02, 2023Apple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 51"}, "24": {"tables": {}, "text": "Item 9.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial DisclosureNone.Item 9A.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Controls and ProceduresEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and ProceduresBased on an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of the Company\u2019s management, the Company\u2019s principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that the Company\u2019s disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act were effective as of September\u00a030, 2023 to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is (i)\u00a0recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC rules and forms and (ii)\u00a0accumulated and communicated to the Company\u2019s management, including its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.Inherent Limitations over Internal ControlsThe Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP. The Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that:\u00a0(i)pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the Company\u2019s assets;(ii)provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and that the Company\u2019s receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of the Company\u2019s management and directors; and(iii)provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the Company\u2019s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.Management, including the Company\u2019s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that the Company\u2019s internal controls will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of internal controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. Also, any evaluation of the effectiveness of controls in future periods are subject to the risk that those internal controls may become inadequate because of changes in business conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.Management\u2019s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial ReportingThe Company\u2019s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act). Management conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria set forth in Internal Control \u2013 Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework). Based on the Company\u2019s assessment, management has concluded that its internal control over financial reporting was effective as of September\u00a030, 2023 to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP. The Company\u2019s independent registered public accounting firm, Ernst & Young LLP, has issued an audit report on the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting, which appears in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K.Changes in Internal Control over Financial ReportingThere were no changes in the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting during the fourth quarter of 2023, which were identified in connection with management\u2019s evaluation required by paragraph (d) of Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting.Apple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 52"}}}
