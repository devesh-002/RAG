edition, and other standard windows operating systems, including windows xp home. premium offerings are windows operating systems sold at a premium above windows xp home. client revenue growth correlates with the growth of purchases of pcs from oems that pre-install versions of windows operating systems because the oem channel accounts for over 80% of total client revenue.  client revenue increased in fiscal year 2006 reflecting $1.18 billion or 12% growth in oem revenue driven by 17% growth in oem license units from increased pc unit shipments, partially offset by a $118 million or 6% decrease in revenue from commercial and retail licensing of windows operating systems. during the year, the mix of oem windows operating systems licensed with premium edition operating systems as a percentage of total oem windows operating systems licensed (\u0093oem premium mix\u0094) increased two percentage points to 52%. oem revenue growth included an increase to revenue of $89 million resulting from the alignment of our billings associated with oem distributors in our system builder channel with both industry standards and other microsoft channels. the differences between unit growth rates and revenue growth rates from year to year are affected by changes in the oem premium mix, changes in the geographical mix, and the channel mix of products sold by large, multi-national oems versus those sold by local and regional system builders. client revenue increased in fiscal year 2005 driven by 12% growth in oem license units and $886 million or 10% growth in oem revenue from increased pc unit shipments, partially offset by a $198 million or 9% decrease in revenue from commercial and retail licensing of windows operating systems. the oem premium mix remained flat at 50% of total oem windows operating systems as compared to the previous year. revenue earned from upgrade advantage declined by $99 million in fiscal year 2005 contributing to the decrease in commercial and retail licensing revenue.  client operating income increased in fiscal year 2006 reflecting the increase in oem revenue partially offset by a $224 million increase in sales and marketing expenses, excluding headcount-related costs, mainly driven by increased investments in partner marketing and windows vista pre-launch programs. headcount-related costs increased 6% in fiscal year 2006 reflecting both a 13% increase in headcount primarily associated with windows vista and further investments in our sales and marketing organization, and an increase in salaries and benefits for existing headcount, partially offset by a decrease in stock-based compensation expense. client operating income increased in fiscal year 2005 primarily due to an increase in oem revenue and a $444 million decrease in stock-based compensation expense. these factors were partially offset by an increase in sales and marketing expenses associated with \u0093start something,\u0094 a globally launched advertising campaign, marketing for security initiatives, and an increase in salary and benefits for new and existing headcount. the additional headcount for research and development was primarily devoted to the continued development of windows vista.  server and tools  \u00a0 server and tools consists of server software licenses and client access licenses (\u0093cal\u0094) for windows server, microsoft sql server, exchange server and other server products. it also includes developer tools, training, certification, microsoft press, premier and professional product support services, and microsoft consulting services. server and tools concentrates on licensing products, applications, tools, content and services that make information technology professionals and developers more productive and efficient. the segment uses multiple channels for licensing including pre-installed oem versions, licenses through partners, and licenses directly to end customers. the licenses are sold both as one-time licenses and as multi-year volume licenses. server and tools uses product innovation and partnerships with information technology professionals to drive the adoption and sales growth of its products.  server and tools revenue increased during fiscal year 2006 mainly driven by growth in sql server, windows server, and core cal. sql server 2005 and visual studio 2005 were launched in the second quarter of fiscal year 2006 and produced revenue growth in these product lines. revenue is impacted by overall server hardware shipments which we estimate grew 11% to 13% in fiscal year 2006. server and server applications revenue, including cal revenue, and developer tools, training and certification revenue grew $1.31 billion or 16% during fiscal year 2006. the

billion in microsoft common stock. the repurchases were made using our cash resources. during fiscal year 2006, we repurchased 754\u00a0million shares, or $19.75 billion, of our common stock under this plan. on july\u00a020, 2006, we also announced that our board of directors authorized new share repurchase programs, comprised of a $20 billion tender offer which was completed on august\u00a017, 2006, and an additional $20 billion ongoing share repurchase program with an expiration of june\u00a030, 2011. under the tender offer, we repurchased approximately 155 million shares of our common stock, or approximately 1.5% of the common shares outstanding, for approximately $3.8 billion at a price per share of $24.75. on august 18, 2006, we announced that the authorization for the ongoing share repurchase program, previously announced on july 20, 2006, had been increased by approximately $16.2 billion. as a result, the company is authorized to repurchase additional shares in an amount up to $36.2 billion through june 30, 2011.  we believe existing cash and short-term investments, together with funds generated from operations should be sufficient to meet operating requirements, quarterly dividends and planned share repurchases. our philosophy regarding the maintenance of a balance sheet with a large component of cash and short-term investments, and equity and other investments, reflects our views on potential future capital requirements relating to research and development, creation and expansion of sales distribution channels, investments and acquisitions, share dilution management, legal risks, and challenges to our business model. we regularly assess our investment management approach in view of our current and potential future needs.  off-balance

effect of the application of this consensus on prior period results should be recognized through a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the year of adoption. elective retrospective application is also permitted. we are currently evaluating the financial impact of this guidance and the method of adoption that will be used.  application of critical accounting policies  our financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with u.s. gaap. preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. these estimates and assumptions are affected by management\u0092s application of accounting policies. critical accounting policies for us include revenue recognition, impairment of investment securities, impairment of goodwill, accounting for research and development costs, accounting for legal contingencies, accounting for income taxes, and accounting for stock-based compensation.  we account for the licensing of software in accordance with american institute of certified public accountants statement of position (\u0093sop\u0094) 97-2, software revenue recognition. the application of sop 97-2 requires judgment, including whether a software arrangement includes multiple elements, and if so, whether vendor-specific objective evidence (\u0093vsoe\u0094) of fair value exists for those elements. customers receive certain elements of our products over a period of time. these elements include free post-delivery telephone support and the right to receive unspecified upgrades/enhancements of microsoft internet explorer on a when-and-if-available basis, the fair value of which is recognized over the product\u0092s estimated life cycle. changes to the elements in a software arrangement, the ability to identify vsoe for those elements, the fair value of the respective elements, and changes to a product\u0092s estimated life cycle could materially impact the amount of earned and unearned revenue. judgment is also required to assess whether future releases of certain software represent new products or upgrades and enhancements to existing products.  sfas no.\u00a0115, accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities, and sec sab 59, accounting for noncurrent marketable equity securities, provide guidance on determining when an investment is other-than-temporarily impaired. investments are reviewed quarterly for indicators of other-than-temporary impairment. this determination requires significant judgment. in making this judgment, we employ a systematic methodology quarterly that considers available quantitative and qualitative evidence in evaluating potential impairment of our investments. if the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value, we evaluate, among other factors, general market conditions, the duration and extent to which the fair value is less than cost, and our intent and ability to hold the investment. we also consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of and business outlook for the investee, including industry and sector performance, changes in technology, operational and financing cash flow factors, and rating agency actions. once a decline in fair value is determined to be other-than-temporary, an impairment charge is recorded and a new cost basis in the investment is established. if market, industry, and/or investee conditions deteriorate, we may incur future impairments.  sfas no.\u00a0142, goodwill and other intangible assets, requires that goodwill be tested for impairment at the reporting unit level (operating segment or one level below an operating segment) on an annual basis (july 1 for us) and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. these events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate, legal factors, operating performance indicators, competition or sale or disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit. application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment, including the identification of reporting units, assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units, assignment of goodwill to reporting units, and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit. the fair value of each reporting unit is estimated using a discounted cash flow methodology. this requires significant judgments including estimation of future cash flows, which is dependent on internal forecasts, estimation of the long-term rate of growth for our business, the useful life over which cash flows will occur, and determination of our weighted average cost of capital. changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and/or goodwill impairment for each reporting unit. we allocate goodwill to reporting units based on the reporting unit expected benefit from the combination. we evaluate our reporting units on an annual basis and if necessary, reassign goodwill using a relative fair value allocation approach.  \u00a0  "

systematic methodology on a quarterly basis that considers available quantitative and qualitative evidence in evaluating potential impairment of our investments. if the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value, we evaluate, among other factors, general market conditions, the duration and extent to which the fair value is less than cost, and our intent and ability to hold the investment. we also consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of and business outlook for the investee, including industry and sector performance, changes in technology, operational and financing cash flow factors, and rating agency actions. once a decline in fair value is determined to be other-than-temporary, an impairment charge is recorded and a new cost basis in the investment is established.  we use derivative instruments to manage exposures to foreign currency, equity price, interest rate and credit risks, to enhance returns, and to facilitate portfolio diversification. our objectives for holding derivatives include reducing, eliminating, and efficiently managing the economic impact of these exposures as effectively as possible. derivative instruments are recognized as either assets or liabilities and are measured at fair value. the accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation. for a derivative instrument designated as a fair-value hedge, the gain or loss is recognized in earnings in the period of change together with the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item attributed to the risk being hedged. for a derivative instrument designated as a cash-flow hedge, the effective portion of the derivative\u0092s gain or loss is initially reported as a component of oci and is subsequently recognized in earnings when the hedged exposure affects earnings. the ineffective portion of the gain or loss is recognized in earnings. for options designated either as fair-value or cash-flow hedges, changes in the time value are excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and are recognized in earnings. gains and losses from changes in fair values of derivatives that are not designated as hedges for accounting purposes are recognized in earnings.  foreign currency risk.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0certain assets, liabilities, and forecasted transactions are exposed to foreign currency risk. we monitor our foreign currency exposures daily to maximize the overall effectiveness of our foreign currency hedge positions. options are used to hedge a portion of forecasted international revenue for up to three years in the future and are designated as cash-flow hedging instruments under statement of financial accounting standards (\u0093sfas\u0094) no.\u00a0133, accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities. principal currencies hedged include the euro, japanese yen, british pound, and canadian dollar. certain non-u.s. dollars denominated securities are hedged using foreign exchange forward contracts that are designated as fair-value hedging instruments under sfas no.\u00a0133. certain options and forwards not designated as hedging instruments under sfas no.\u00a0133 are also used to hedge the impact of the variability in exchange rates on accounts receivable and collections denominated in certain foreign currencies and to manage other foreign currency exposures.  equities price risk.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0equity investments are subject to market price risk. from time to time, we use and designate options to hedge fair values and cash flows on certain equity securities. we determine the security, or forecasted sale thereof, selected for hedging by evaluating market conditions, up-front costs, and other relevant factors. certain options, futures and swap contracts, not designated as hedging instruments under sfas no.\u00a0133, are also used to manage equity exposures.  interest rate risk.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0fixed-income securities are subject to interest rate risk. the fixed-income portfolio is diversified and consists primarily of investment grade securities to minimize credit risk. we use exchange-traded option and future contracts and over-the-counter swap contracts, not designated as hedging instruments under sfas no.\u00a0133, to hedge interest rate risk.  other derivatives.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0swap contracts, not designated as hedging instruments under sfas no.\u00a0133, are used to manage exposures to credit risks, enhance returns, and to

derivative financial instruments and are not designated as hedging instruments. \u0093to be announced\u0094 forward purchase commitments of mortgage-backed assets are also considered derivatives in cases where physical delivery of the assets are not taken at the earliest available delivery date. all derivative instruments not designated as hedging instruments are recorded at fair value, with changes in value recognized in earnings during the period of change.  \u00a0    "

the decision to the court of first instance on june\u00a06, 2004. on december\u00a022, 2004, the court ordered that we must comply with the decision pending review on appeal and we are taking steps to ensure we are in compliance. the hearing on the appeal occurred in april 2006. we continue to contest the conclusion that european competition law was infringed and will defend our position vigorously. in december 2005, the commission issued a statement of objections that preliminarily concluded we were not in full compliance with the 2004 decree. in march 2006, the commission conducted an oral hearing on the statement of objections and our response to the statement. on july\u00a012, 2006, the european commission announced its determination that we had not complied with the technical documentation requirements of the 2004 decision, and levied a fine of \u0080281 million ($351 million). we will appeal this fine to the court of first instance.  on december\u00a07, 2005, the korean fair trade commission (\u0093kftc\u0094) announced a ruling in its investigation of us, holding that we abused a market dominant position and engaged in unfair trade practices under the korean fair trade law by incorporating instant messaging and media player functionality into the windows pc operating system, and streaming media technologies into the windows server operating system. the kftc also announced the imposition of remedies, including a fine of approximately $34 million. the kftc issued its formal written ruling and corrective order on february\u00a023, 2006. the kftc held that our integration of windows media player and windows messenger in windows pc operating systems and integration of windows media services in windows server operating systems constituted an abuse of monopoly power and unlawful tying in violation of the korean fair trade act. under the order, which became effective august\u00a024, 2006, we can no longer distribute windows in korea as currently designed. we are required to develop and distribute in korea versions of windows xp and its successors that do not include windows media player or windows messenger functionality. in addition, we also may distribute a second modified version of windows that contains the removed functionality, provided the second version includes promotional links in the user interface that will enable consumers to link to and download a select group of competing media players and instant messengers. we have appealed the kftc\u0092s decision to the seoul high court. on may\u00a022, 2006, the kftc denied our motion for reconsideration of its ruling. as part of that decision, the kftc dropped the element of its ruling that prohibited us from including windows media player or windows messenger, or any feature with similar functionality, in any product other than the windows client operating system for which we have a 50% or greater market share. on august 23, 2006, we announced the release to manufacture of the mandated versions of windows xp home edition and windows xp professional edition.  in other ongoing investigations, various foreign governments and several state attorneys general have requested information from us concerning competition, privacy, and security issues.  antitrust, and unfair competition, and overcharge class actions.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0a large number of antitrust and unfair competition class action lawsuits have been filed against us in various state and federal courts on behalf of variously defined classes of direct and indirect purchasers of our pc operating system and certain software applications products. the federal cases have been consolidated in the u.s. district court for maryland. these cases allege that we competed unfairly and unlawfully monopolized alleged markets for operating systems and certain software applications, and they seek to recover alleged overcharges for these products. to date, courts have dismissed all claims for damages in cases brought against us by indirect purchasers under federal law and in 18 states. ten of those state court decisions have been affirmed on appeal. there was no appeal in five states. in addition, courts in two states refused to certify classes, essentially bringing the litigation to a close. claims under federal law brought on behalf of foreign purchasers have been dismissed by the u.s. district court in maryland as have all claims brought on behalf of consumers seeking injunctive relief under federal law. the ruling on injunctive relief and the ruling dismissing the federal claims of indirect purchasers were appealed to the united states court of appeals for the fourth circuit, together with a ruling denying certification of certain proposed classes of u.s. direct purchasers. on april\u00a018, 2006, the court of appeals affirmed the trial court decision dismissing the indirect purchaser claims. courts in 18 states have ruled that indirect purchaser cases may proceed as class actions. in 2003, we reached an agreement with counsel for the california plaintiffs to settle all claims in 27 consolidated cases in that state. under the settlement, class members will be able to obtain vouchers that entitle the class members to be reimbursed up to the face value of their vouchers for purchases of a wide variety of platform-neutral computer hardware and software. the total value of vouchers issued will depend on the number of class members who make a claim and are issued vouchers. two-thirds of the value of vouchers unissued or

structured similarly to the california settlement, except that, among other differences, one-half of the value of vouchers unissued to class members will be made available to certain schools in the relevant states. the maximum value of vouchers to be issued in these settlements, including the california settlement, is approximately $2.5 billion. the actual costs of these settlements will be less than that maximum amount, depending on the number of class members and schools who are issued and redeem vouchers. the settlements in arizona, california, the district of columbia, florida, kansas, massachusetts, minnesota, montana, nebraska, new mexico, new york, north carolina, north dakota, south dakota, tennessee, vermont, and west virginia have received final court approval. we estimate the total cost to resolve all of these cases will range between $1.5 billion and $1.7 billion, with the actual cost dependent upon many unknown factors such as the quantity and mix of products for which claims will be made, the number of eligible class members who ultimately use the vouchers, the nature of hardware and software that is acquired using the vouchers, and the cost of administering the claims process. in accordance with sfas no.\u00a05, accounting for contingencies, and fin no.\u00a014, reasonable estimation of the amount of a loss, at june\u00a030, 2006, we have recorded a

administrative expenses and legal fees.  other antitrust litigation and claims.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0on august\u00a027, 2004, the city and county of san francisco, the city of los angeles, and los angeles, san mateo, contra costa, and santa clara counties filed a putative class action against us in san francisco superior court. the action was brought on behalf of all governmental entities, agencies, and political subdivisions of the state of california that indirectly purchased our operating system or word processing and spreadsheet software during the period from february\u00a018, 1995 to the date of trial in the action. the plaintiffs sought treble damages under california\u0092s cartwright act and disgorgement of unlawful profits under its unfair competition act resulting from our alleged combinations to restrain trade, deny competition, and monopolize the world markets for pc operating systems and word processing and spreadsheet applications (and productivity suites including these applications). we removed the case to the u.s. district court for maryland. our motion to dismiss the complaint was granted on april\u00a018, 2005 with leave to file an amended complaint alleging claims under the cartwright act based on conduct within the four-year statute of limitation the court ruled applies to the plaintiffs\u0092 claims. we have obtained final approval of settlement of this case, which resolves all claims asserted in the lawsuit.  on november\u00a012, 2004, novell, inc. filed a complaint in the u.s. district court for utah asserting antitrust and unfair competition claims against us related to novell\u0092s ownership of wordperfect and other productivity applications during the period between june 1994 and march 1996. on june\u00a010, 2005, the trial court granted our motion to dismiss four of six claims of the complaint. an appeal of that ruling is now pending and the case is effectively stayed during the appeal.  patent and intellectual property claims.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0we are a defendant in more than 35 patent infringement cases that we are defending vigorously. in the case of eolas technologies, inc. and university of california v. microsoft, filed in the u.s. district court for the northern district of illinois on february\u00a02, 1999, the plaintiffs alleged infringement by the browser functionality of windows. on august\u00a011, 2003, the jury awarded the plaintiffs approximately $520 million in damages for infringement from the date the plaintiffs\u0092 patent was issued through september 2001. the plaintiffs are seeking an equitable accounting for damages from september 2001 to the present. on january\u00a014, 2004, the trial court entered final judgment of $565 million, including post-trial interest of $45 million, and entered an injunction against distribution of any new infringing products, but stayed execution of the judgment and the injunction pending our appeal. we appealed and on march\u00a02, 2005 the court of appeals for the federal circuit reversed the decision and vacated the judgment, ruling that the trial court had erred in excluding certain previous art evidence and ruling as a matter of law on other evidence. the appellate court also reversed the trial court\u0092s decision that the inventors had not engaged in inequitable conduct by failing to reveal material previous art while obtaining the patent. we believe the total cost to resolve this case will not be material to our financial position or results of operations. the actual costs will be dependent upon many unknown factors such as the events of a retrial of the plaintiff\u0092s claims. in microsoft v. lucent, filed in the u.s. district court in san diego on april\u00a08, 2003, we are seeking a declaratory judgment that we do not infringe any valid patent among a number of patents lucent has been asserting against computer manufacturers that sell computers with our software pre-installed. the first in a series of back-to-back trials on the various patent groupings is currently set to begin on november\u00a020, 2006. on march\u00a028, 2006, lucent filed a new lawsuit
