user experience through well-integrated software, hardware, and services. its success depends on a number of factors including the extent to which customers embrace its new user interface and functionality, successfully coordinating with our oem partners in releasing a variety of hardware devices that take advantage of its features, and attracting developers at scale to ensure a competitive array of quality applications. we expect to incur substantial marketing costs in launching window 8 and associated services and devices, which may reduce our operating margins.  we may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property rights.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0protecting our global intellectual property rights and combating unlicensed copying and use of software and other intellectual property is difficult. while piracy adversely affects u.s. revenue, the impact on revenue from outside the u.s. is more significant, particularly in countries where laws are less protective of intellectual property rights. as a result, our revenue in these markets may grow slower than the underlying pc market. similarly, the absence of harmonized patent laws makes it more difficult to ensure consistent respect for patent rights. throughout the world, we actively educate consumers about the benefits of licensing genuine products and obtaining indemnification benefits for intellectual property risks, and we educate lawmakers about the advantages of a business climate where intellectual property rights are protected. however, continued educational and enforcement efforts may fail to enhance revenue. reductions in the legal protection for software intellectual property rights could adversely affect revenue.  third parties may claim we infringe their intellectual property rights.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0from time to time, we receive notices from others claiming we infringe their intellectual property rights. the number of these claims may grow because of constant technological change in the segments in which we compete, the extensive patent coverage of existing technologies, and the rapid rate of issuance of new patents. to resolve these claims we may enter into royalty and licensing agreements on terms that are less favorable than currently available, stop selling or redesign affected products, or pay damages to satisfy indemnification commitments with our customers. these outcomes may cause operating margins to decline. in addition to money damages, in some jurisdictions plaintiffs can seek injunctive relief that may limit or prevent importing, marketing, and selling our products that have infringing technologies. in some countries, such as germany, an injunction can be issued before the parties have fully litigated the validity of the underlying patents. we have made and expect to continue making significant expenditures to settle claims related to the use of technology and intellectual property rights and to procure intellectual property rights as part of our strategy to manage this risk.  we may not be able to protect our source code from copying if there is an unauthorized disclosure of source code.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0source code, the detailed program commands for our operating systems and other software programs, is critical to our business. although we license portions of our application and operating system source code to a number of licensees, we take significant measures to protect the secrecy of large portions of our source code. if an unauthorized disclosure of a significant portion of our source code occurs, we could potentially lose future trade secret protection for that source code. this could make it easier for third parties to compete with our products by copying functionality, which could adversely affect our revenue and operating margins. unauthorized disclosure of source code also could increase the security risks described in the next paragraph.  cyber-attacks and security vulnerabilities could lead to reduced revenue, increased costs, liability claims, or harm to our competitive position. security of microsoft\u0092s information

take a variety of forms. hackers develop and deploy viruses, worms, and other malicious software programs that attack our products and services and gain access to our networks and data centers. groups of hackers may also act in a coordinated manner to launch distributed denial of service attacks, or other coordinated attacks. sophisticated organizations or individuals may launch targeted attacks using novel methods to gain access to computers running our software. these threats may result in breaches of our network or data security, disruptions of our internal systems and business applications, impairment of our ability to provide services to our customers, product development delays, harm to our competitive position from the compromise of confidential business information, or other negative impacts on our business.  \u00a0 16 "

foreign currency revenue.  income taxes  fiscal year 2012 compared with fiscal year 2011  our effective tax rates for fiscal years 2012 and 2011 were approximately 24% and 18%, respectively. our effective tax rates were lower than the u.s. federal statutory rate primarily due to earnings taxed at lower rates in foreign jurisdictions resulting from producing and distributing our products and services through our foreign regional operations centers in ireland, singapore, and puerto rico, which have lower income tax rates.  our fiscal year 2012 effective rate increased by 6% from fiscal year 2011 mainly due to a nonrecurring $6.2 billion non-tax deductible goodwill impairment charge that was recorded in the fourth quarter of 2012. the goodwill impairment charge increased our effective tax rate by 10%. in addition, in fiscal years 2012 and 2011, we recognized a reduction of 21% and 16%, respectively, to the effective tax rate due to foreign earnings taxed at lower rates. in fiscal year 2011, we settled a portion of an i.r.s. audit of tax years 2004 to 2006, which reduced our income tax expense for fiscal year 2011 by $461 million and reduced the effective tax rate by 2%.  changes in the mix of income before income taxes between the u.s. and foreign countries also impacted our effective tax rates and resulted primarily from changes in the geographic distribution of and changes in consumer demand for our products and services. as discussed above, windows division operating income declined $751 million in fiscal year 2012, while mbd and server and tools operating income increased $1.1 billion and $1.1 billion, respectively, during this same period. we supply windows, our primary windows division product, to customers through our u.s. regional operating center, while we supply the microsoft office system, our primary mbd product, and our server and tools products to customers through our foreign regional operations centers. in fiscal years 2012 and 2011, our u.s. income before income taxes was $1.6 billion and $8.9 billion, respectively, and comprised 7% and 32%, respectively, of our income before income taxes. in fiscal years 2012 and 2011, the foreign income before income taxes was $20.7 billion and $19.2 billion, respectively, and comprised 93% and 68%, respectively, of our income before income taxes. the primary driver for the decrease in the u.s. income before income tax in fiscal year 2012 was the goodwill impairment charge.  tax contingencies and other tax liabilities were $7.6 billion and $7.4 billion as of june\u00a030, 2012 and 2011, respectively, and are included in other long-term liabilities. while we settled a portion of the i.r.s. audit for tax years 2004 to 2006 during the third quarter of fiscal year 2011, we remain under audit for these years. in february 2012, the i.r.s. withdrew its 2011 revenue agents report and reopened the audit phase of the examination. as of june\u00a030, 2012, the primary unresolved issue relates to transfer pricing which could have a significant impact on our financial statements if not resolved favorably. we believe our allowances for tax contingencies are appropriate. we do not believe it is reasonably possible that the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits will significantly increase or decrease within the next 12 months, as we do not believe the remaining open issues will be resolved within the next 12 months. we also continue to be subject to examination by the i.r.s. for tax years 2007 to 2011.  fiscal year 2011 compared with fiscal year 2010  our effective tax rates for fiscal years 2011 and 2010 were approximately 18% and 25%, respectively. our effective tax rate was lower than the u.s. federal statutory rate and our prior year effective rate primarily due to a higher mix of earnings taxed at lower rates in foreign jurisdictions resulting from producing and distributing our products and services through our foreign regional operations centers in ireland, singapore, and puerto rico, which have lower income tax rates. in fiscal years 2011 and 2010, our u.s. income before income taxes was $8.9 billion\u00a0and $9.6 billion, respectively, and comprised 32% and 38%, respectively, of our income before income taxes.\u00a0in fiscal years 2011 and 2010, the foreign income before income taxes was $19.2 billion and $15.4 billion, respectively, and comprised 68% and 62%, respectively, of our income before income taxes. in fiscal years 2011 and 2010, the reduction of the u.s. federal statutory rate as a result of foreign earnings taxed at lower rates was 16% and 12%, respectively.  \u00a0 35 "

(\u0093yahoo!\u0094) whereby microsoft will provide the exclusive algorithmic and paid search platform for yahoo! websites. microsoft provided yahoo! with revenue per search guarantees for a period of 18 months after implementation of the microsoft search ads platform in each country, extended by an additional 12 months for the u.s. and canada. these guarantees are calculated, paid, and adjusted periodically and are rate guarantees, not guarantees of search volume. we estimate the remaining cost of the revenue per search guarantees during the guarantee period could range up to $120 million.  note 17 - contingencies  antitrust, unfair competition, and overcharge class actions  a large number of antitrust and unfair competition class action lawsuits were filed against us in various state, federal, and canadian courts on behalf of various classes of direct and indirect purchasers of our pc operating system and certain other software products between 1999 and 2005. we obtained dismissals or reached settlements of all claims made in the united states.  all settlements in the united states have received final court approval. under the settlements, generally class members can obtain vouchers that entitle them to be reimbursed for purchases of a wide variety of platform-neutral computer hardware and software. the total value of vouchers that we may issue varies by state. we will make available to certain schools a percentage of those vouchers that are not issued or claimed (one-half to two-thirds depending on the state). the total value of vouchers we ultimately issue will depend on the number of class members who make claims and are issued vouchers. the maximum value of vouchers to be issued is approximately $2.7 billion. the actual costs of these settlements will be less than that maximum amount, depending on the number of class members and schools that are issued and redeem vouchers. we estimate the total cost to resolve all of the state overcharge class action cases will range between $1.9 billion and $2.0 billion. at june\u00a030, 2012, we have recorded a liability related to these claims of approximately $500 million, which reflects our estimated exposure of $1.9 billion less payments made to date of approximately $1.4 billion mostly for vouchers, legal fees, and administrative expenses.  \u00a0 75 "

(\u0093novell\u0094) filed a complaint in u.s. district court for the district of utah (later transferred to federal court in maryland), asserting antitrust and unfair competition claims against us related to novell\u0092s ownership of wordperfect and other productivity applications during the period between june 1994 and march 1996. in june 2005, the trial court granted our motion to dismiss four of six claims of the complaint. in march\u00a02010, the trial court granted summary judgment in favor of microsoft as to all remaining claims. the court of appeals reversed that ruling as to one claim. trial of that claim took place from october to december 2011 and resulted in a mistrial because the jury was unable to reach a verdict. in july 2012, the trial court granted microsoft\u0092s motion for judgment as a matter of law. novell may appeal this decision.  government competition law matters  in december 2009, the european commission adopted a decision that rendered legally binding commitments offered by microsoft to address the commission\u0092s concerns about the inclusion of web browsing software in windows.\u00a0among other things, microsoft committed to display a \u0093browser choice screen\u0094 on windows-based pcs in europe where internet explorer is set as the default browser. due to a technical error, we failed to deliver the requisite software to enable that display to pcs that came preinstalled with a version of windows 7 called windows 7 service pack 1. we did deliver the requisite software to pcs running the original version of windows 7 and earlier editions of windows. following notification by the commission of reports that some pcs were not receiving the update, we promptly fixed the error and advised the commission of what we had discovered. pcs that come preinstalled with windows 7 service pack are now receiving the browser choice screen software, as intended.\u00a0on july\u00a017, 2012, the commission announced that it had opened proceedings to investigate whether microsoft had failed to comply with this commitment. the commission stated that if a company is found to have breached a legally binding commitment, the company may be fined up to 10% of its worldwide annual revenue.  patent and intellectual property claims  motorola litigation  in october 2010, microsoft filed patent infringement complaints against motorola mobility (\u0093motorola\u0094) with the international trade commission (\u0093itc\u0094) and in u.s. district court in seattle for infringement of nine microsoft patents by motorola\u0092s android devices. since then, microsoft and motorola have filed additional claims against each other in the itc, in federal district courts in seattle, wisconsin, florida, and california, and in courts in germany and the united kingdom. in april 2012, following complaints by microsoft and apple, the european union\u0092s competition office opened two antitrust investigations against motorola to determine whether it has abused certain of its standard essential patents to distort competition in breach of european union antitrust rules. in june 2012, we received a request for information from the u.s. federal trade commission (\u0093ftc\u0094) apparently related to an ftc investigation into whether motorola\u0092s conduct violates u.s. law. the nature of the claims asserted and status of individual matters are summarized below.  international trade commission  the hearing in microsoft\u0092s itc case against motorola took place in august 2011 on seven of the nine patents originally asserted in the complaint. in december 2011, the administrative law judge (\u0093alj\u0094) issued an initial determination that motorola infringed one microsoft patent, and recommended that the itc issue a limited exclusion  \u00a0 76 "
