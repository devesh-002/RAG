to make significant investments in research, development, and marketing for existing products, services, and technologies, including the windows operating system, the microsoft office system, bing, windows phone, windows server, the windows store, the windows azure services platform, office 365, other cloud-based services offerings, and the xbox 360 entertainment platform. we will continue to invest in new software and hardware products, services, and technologies, such as the microsoft-designed and manufactured surface launched in october 2012. investments in new technology are speculative. commercial success depends on many factors, including innovativeness, developer support, and effective distribution and marketing. if customers do not perceive our latest offerings as providing significant new functionality or other value, they may reduce their purchases of new software products or upgrades, unfavorably impacting revenue. we may not achieve significant revenue from new product, service, and distribution channel investments for a number of years, if at all. moreover, new products and services may not be profitable, and even if they are profitable, operating margins for some new products and businesses will not be as high as the margins we have experienced historically.  in october 2012, we launched windows\u00a08, a major new release of our operating system, which seeks to deliver a unique user experience through well-integrated software, hardware, and services. its success depends on a number of factors including the extent to which customers embrace the new user interface and functionality, successfully coordinating with our oem partners in releasing a variety of hardware devices that take advantage of new features, pricing windows 8-based devices competitively, and attracting developers at scale to ensure a competitive array of quality applications. the marketing costs we are incurring to promote windows 8 and associated services and devices may reduce our operating margins.  acquisitions, joint ventures, and strategic alliances may have an adverse effect on our business.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0we expect to continue making acquisitions or entering into joint ventures and strategic alliances as part of our long-term business strategy. these transactions involve significant challenges and risks including that the transaction does not advance our business strategy, that we do not realize a satisfactory return on our investment, that we experience difficulty integrating new employees, business systems, and technology, or that the transaction diverts management\u0092s attention from our other businesses. our acquisition of skype, for example, provides opportunities to enhance our existing products. the success of this acquisition will depend in part on our ability to provide compelling experiences that distinguish us from our competitors in both consumer and business markets. it may take longer than expected to realize the full benefits from these transactions, such as increased revenue, enhanced efficiencies, or increased market share, or the benefits may ultimately be smaller than anticipated or may not be realized. these events could harm our operating results or financial condition.  we may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property rights.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0protecting our global intellectual property rights and combating unlicensed copying and use of our software and other intellectual property is difficult. while piracy adversely affects u.s. revenue, the impact on revenue from outside the u.s. is more significant, particularly in countries where laws are less protective of intellectual property rights. as a result, our revenue in these markets may grow slower than the underlying pc market. similarly, the absence of harmonized patent laws makes it more difficult to ensure consistent respect for patent rights. throughout the world, we actively educate consumers about the benefits of licensing genuine products and obtaining indemnification benefits for intellectual property risks, and we educate lawmakers about the advantages of a business climate where intellectual property rights are protected. however, continued educational and enforcement efforts may fail to enhance revenue. reductions in the legal protection for software intellectual property rights could adversely affect revenue.  third parties may claim we infringe their intellectual property rights.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0from time to time, we receive notices from others claiming we infringe their intellectual property rights. the number of these claims may grow because of constant technological change in the segments in which we compete, the extensive patent coverage of existing technologies, the rapid rate of issuance of new patents, and our offering of microsoft-branded services and hardware devices, such as surface. to resolve these claims we may enter into royalty and licensing agreements on terms that are less favorable than currently available, stop selling or redesign affected products or services, or pay damages to satisfy indemnification commitments with our customers. these outcomes may cause operating margins to decline. in addition to money damages, in some jurisdictions plaintiffs can seek injunctive relief that may limit or prevent importing, marketing, and selling our products or services that have infringing technologies. in some countries, such  \u00a0 16 "

ultimate tax determination is uncertain. we regularly are under audit by tax authorities. economic\u00a0and political\u00a0pressures to increase tax revenues in various jurisdictions may make resolving tax disputes more difficult. although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals. the results of an audit or litigation could have a material effect on our financial statements in the period or periods for which that determination is made.  we earn a significant amount of our operating income from outside the u.s., and any repatriation of funds currently held in foreign jurisdictions to the u.s. may result in higher effective tax rates for the company. in addition, there have been proposals from congress to change u.s. tax laws that would significantly impact how u.s. multinational corporations are taxed on foreign earnings.

effectively address such issues through design, testing, or warranty repairs. we obtain some components of our hardware devices from sole suppliers. our competitors use some of the same suppliers and their demand for hardware components can affect the amount of capacity available to us. if a component delivery from a sole-source supplier is delayed or becomes unavailable or industry shortages

certain other critical business operations are located in the seattle, washington area, and we have other business operations in the silicon valley area of california, both of which are near major earthquake faults. a catastrophic event that results in the destruction or disruption of any of our critical business or it systems could harm our ability to conduct normal business operations. our move toward providing our customers with more services and solutions in the cloud puts a premium on the resilience of our systems and strength of our business continuity management plans, and magnifies the potential impact of prolonged service outages on our operating results. abrupt political change, terrorist activity, and armed conflict pose a risk of general economic disruption in affected countries, which may increase our operating costs. these conditions also may add uncertainty to the timing and budget for technology investment decisions by our customers, and may result in supply chain disruptions for hardware manufacturers, either of which may adversely affect our revenue. the long-term effects of climate change on the global economy in general or the it industry in particular are unclear. environmental regulations or changes in the supply, demand or available sources of energy may affect the availability or cost of goods and services, including natural resources, necessary to run our business. changes in weather where we operate may increase the costs of powering and cooling computer hardware we use to develop software and provide cloud-based

and (2)\u00a0microsoft is a third-party beneficiary of those commitments. the court rejected motorola\u0092s argument that microsoft had repudiated its right to a rand license, and ruled a trial is needed to determine whether motorola is in breach of its obligation to enter into a patent license with microsoft and, if so, the amount of the rand royalty. in april 2012, the court issued a temporary restraining order preventing motorola from taking steps to enforce an injunction in germany relating to the h.264 video patents. in may 2012, the court converted that order into a preliminary injunction.\u00a0motorola appealed the court\u0092s injunction  \u00a0 79 "
