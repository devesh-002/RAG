msn internet access; msn network service; pc and online games; learning and productivity software; mobility; and embedded systems. the majority of the revenue growth from fiscal 2001 stemmed from sales of the xbox video game system released in fiscal 2002. msn internet access revenue increased as a result of both a higher subscriber base and higher average revenue per subscriber due to a reduction in promotional subscriber programs. revenue from msn network services increased despite a declining internet advertising market. revenue from embedded systems in fiscal 2002 grew nicely, however learning and productivity software revenue and pc and online games declined compared to fiscal 2001. in fiscal 2001, revenue from msn network services grew strongly despite a decline in the online advertising market. msn internet access revenue also grew solidly from fiscal 2000 as a result of an increased subscriber base, partially offset by a decline in the average revenue per subscriber due to a larger mix of subscribers contracted under rebate programs. revenue from embedded systems grew strongly from the prior year, while learning and productivity software revenue and pc and online games revenue declined, reflecting softness in the overall consumer market. in fiscal 2000, online revenue growth was very strong and reflected higher subscriber totals, offset by lower net prices for internet access subscriptions compared to the prior year. additionally, strong sales of entertainment software in fiscal 2000 produced robust revenue growth in pc and online games.  \u00a0 consumer commerce investments.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0consumer commerce investments revenue was $182 million, $299 million, and $242 million in 2000, 2001, and 2002. consumer commerce investments include expedia, inc., the homeadvisor online real estate service, and the carpoint online automotive service. the decline in revenue compared to fiscal 2001 reflects the sale of microsoft\u0092s majority ownership of expedia, inc. to usa networks, inc. on february 4, 2002. acquisitions of travelscape.com and vacationspot.com by expedia, inc., and increased product offerings from expedia led to the strong revenue growth in fiscal 2001. the increased overall reach of all properties led to the strong revenue growth in fiscal 2000.  \u00a0 other.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0other revenue, which primarily includes hardware and microsoft press, was $754 million, $630 million, and $530 million in 2000, 2001, and 2002. in fiscal 2002, continued declines in the it book and consumer market led to a decline in microsoft press and hardware sales. lower sales of gaming devices and other hardware peripherals as a result of weakness in the consumer market caused the decline in revenue in fiscal 2001. continued success of the company\u0092s new hardware device offerings led to revenue growth in fiscal 2000.  \u00a0 distribution channels  \u00a0 microsoft distributes its products primarily through the following channels: oem; volume licensing; online services and products; and distributors and retailers. oem channel revenue represents license fees from original equipment manufacturers who preinstall microsoft products, primarily on pcs. microsoft has three major geographic sales and marketing regions: the south pacific and americas region; the europe, middle east, and africa region; and the asia region. sales of volume licenses and packaged software products via these channels are primarily to distributors and resellers.  oem revenue was $7.01 billion in 2000, $7.86 billion in 2001, and $9.00 billion in 2002. in fiscal 2002, reported licenses declined compared to fiscal 2001. however, a strong increase in the mix of the higher priced windows 2000 and windows xp professional licenses, and healthy growth in direct and system builder oems licenses, led to higher average revenue per license and contributed to the overall oem revenue growth over fiscal 2001. in fiscal 2001, while total licenses were also impacted by a slowdown in pc shipments, the mix of the higher priced windows 2000 professional and windows nt workstation increased substantially resulting in higher average revenue per license. a relatively low growth rate in fiscal 2000 was due to lower business pc shipment growth combined with post mid-year availability of windows 2000 professional. average earned revenue per license also declined in fiscal 2000 compared to the prior year, due in part to a mix shift to the lower-priced windows 98 operating system reflecting the softness in demand for business pcs and lower prices on \u00a0operating systems licensed through certain oem channel sectors.  south pacific and americas region revenue was $8.33 billion, $9.52 billion, and $11.41 billion in 2000, 2001, and 2002. in fiscal 2002, the majority of the revenue growth was driven by sales of the xbox video game system released during the year, as well as strong windows xp professional licensing, msn subscription revenue, and revenue from microsoft great plains. in fiscal 2001, revenue growth was led by strong licensing of windows 2000 professional and the family of .net enterprise servers, particularly sql server 2000 and exchange 2000 server. revenue from enterprise services and msn subscription and services also grew strongly in fiscal 2001. in fiscal 2000, office 2000 integrated suites, windows 2000 server, online revenue, and sql server sales were the primary drivers of the revenue growth. strong retail sales of hardware devices and consumer software also contributed to the growth over the prior year.  europe, middle east, and africa region revenue was $5.02 billion, $4.86 billion, and $5.13 billion in 2000, 2001, and 2002. in fiscal 2002, the majority of the growth was a result of strong multi-year licensing revenue of windows xp home and professional operating systems and enterprise software, as well as the addition of xbox video game system revenue in the second half of the year. in fiscal 2001, weakening local currencies negatively impacted translated revenue compared to the prior year, while revenue from windows 2000 professional and the .net enterprise server family of products was very healthy. in fiscal 2000, retail sales of windows operating systems and    \u00a0    "

            "text": "table of contents   \u00a0part ii\u00a0  item 7  \u00a0   office licensing produced moderate growth in the region. growth from sql server licensing, new hardware device offerings, and entertainment software was especially strong.  asia region revenue was $2.60 billion in 2000, $3.06 billion in 2001, and $2.83 billion in 2002. in fiscal 2002, asia region revenue declined most notably due to lower consumer pc shipments, which hampered revenue from localized versions of microsoft office 2000 and microsoft office xp, especially the office personal edition. xbox video game system sales partially offset the decline in office revenue. in fiscal 2001, the region\u0092s growth rate reflected strong revenue from localized versions of microsoft office 2000 and microsoft office xp, especially the office personal edition. this growth was also attributable to windows 2000 professional and .net server applications licensing. in fiscal 2000, the region\u0092s growth rate reflected strong performance resulting from improved local economic conditions. revenue growth was also influenced by robust growth of localized versions of microsoft office 2000, especially the office personal edition sold in japan, windows platform and server licensing, and strong adoption of sql server.  the company\u0092s operating results are affected by foreign exchange rates. approximately 30%, 27%, and 25% of the company\u0092s revenue was collected in foreign currencies during 2000, 2001, and 2002. since a portion of local currency revenue is hedged and much of the company\u0092s international manufacturing costs and operating expenses are also incurred in local currencies, the impact of exchange rates is partially mitigated.  \u00a0 operating expenses  \u00a0 cost of revenue.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0cost of revenue as a percent of revenue was 13.1% in 2000, 13.7% in 2001, and 18.3% in 2002. cost of revenue in fiscal 2002 increased primarily due to costs related to xbox. in fiscal 2001, higher support and service costs associated with the msn internet access and msn network services were partially offset by the lower relative costs associated with organizational licensing and the drop in the mix of packaged product versus the prior year. cost of revenue in fiscal 2000 reflected lower costs associated with webtv networks\u0092 operations, partially offset by the growth in hardware peripherals costs.  \u00a0 research and development.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0the discontinuation of goodwill amortization in fiscal 2002 in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards (sfas) 142, goodwill and other intangible assets, offset the growth in headcount and development costs. in fiscal 2001, the increase in r&d expense was the result of higher headcount-related costs and investments in new product initiatives. the increase in fiscal 2000 was driven primarily by higher headcount-related costs. prospectively, increased headcount and increased spending in server platforms, home & entertainment, business solutions and ce are currently expected to be significant factors affecting future research and development expense growth.  \u00a0 sales and marketing.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0sales and marketing expense as a percentage of revenue was 18.0% in 2000, 19.3% in 2001, and 19.1% in 2002. in fiscal 2002, sales and marketing expense as a percentage of revenue decreased due to lower relative msn customer acquisition marketing and the large relative increase associated with the onset of xbox video game system revenue. in fiscal 2001, sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenue increased due to higher relative headcount-related costs, higher marketing and sales expenses associated with msn, the microsoft agility advertising campaign, and other new sales initiatives. in fiscal 2000, sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenue increased due to higher relative marketing costs associated with new product releases and online marketing. microsoft expects that it will increase spending on information worker, server platforms, and business solutions sales forces and windows client, msn and home & entertainment marketing.  \u00a0 general and administrative.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0general and administrative expenses in fiscal 2002 increased due to a charge of approximately $660 million for estimated expenses related to the company\u0092s consumer class action lawsuits and higher legal fees. in fiscal 2001, general and administrative costs decreased due to a charge related to the settlement of the lawsuit with caldera, inc. recorded in fiscal 2000. excluding this charge in fiscal 2000, general and administrative expenses in fiscal 2001 increased from the prior year due to higher headcount-related costs and legal fees. for fiscal 2000, besides the settlement of the lawsuit, general and administrative expenses also reflected increased legal fees and certain employee stock option-related expenses.  \u00a0 non-operating items, investment income/(loss), and income taxes  \u00a0 losses on equity investees and other consists of microsoft\u0092s share of income or loss from investments accounted for using the equity method, and income or loss attributable to minority interests. the decrease in losses on equity investees and other in fiscal 2002 was attributed to the divestiture of certain equity investments in fiscal 2002. the increase in losses on equity investees and other in fiscal 2001 reflects an increase in the number of such investments during the year. in fiscal 2000 losses on equity investees and other decreased reflecting smaller losses from the msnbc entities.   \u00a0    "

the financial health of and business outlook for the investee, including industry and sector performance, changes in technology, and operational and financing cash flow factors; and the company\u0092s intent and ability to hold the investment.  in connection with the definitive agreement to combine at&t broadband with comcast in a new company to be called at&t comcast corporation, microsoft has agreed to exchange its at&t 5% convertible preferred debt securities for approximately 115 million shares of at&t comcast corporation. it is expected that the transaction will close by december 31, 2002. while it is possible that microsoft could incur a loss on this exchange transaction up to the carrying value of the at&t debt securities, management believes that the ultimate loss, if any, will be significantly less. as management is unable to predict whether there will be a gain or loss on the exchange, no loss has been recorded related to this contingent exchange transaction as of june 30, 2002.  the company\u0092s effective tax rate for fiscal 2002 was 32%. the effective tax rate for fiscal 2001 and fiscal 2000 was 33% and 34%, respectively. the decrease in the effective tax rate is due primarily to lower taxes on foreign earnings.  \u00a0 accounting changes  \u00a0 effective july 1, 2001, microsoft adopted sfas 141, business combinations, and sfas 142, goodwill and other intangible assets. sfas 141 requires business combinations to be accounted for using the purchase method of accounting. it also specifies the types of acquired intangible assets that are required to be recognized and reported separate from goodwill. sfas 142 requires that goodwill and certain intangibles no longer be amortized, but instead tested for impairment at least annually. there was no impairment of goodwill upon adoption of sfas 142. goodwill amortization (on a pre-tax basis) was $234 million in fiscal 2000 and $311 million in fiscal 2001.  effective july 1, 2000, microsoft adopted sfas 133, accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities, which establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts and for hedging activities. the adoption of sfas 133 resulted in a cumulative pre-tax reduction to income of $560 million ($375 million after-tax) and a cumulative pre-tax reduction to other comprehensive income (oci) of $112 million ($75 million after-tax). the reduction to income was mostly attributable to a loss of approximately $300 million reclassified from oci for the time value of options and a loss of approximately $250 million reclassified from oci for derivatives not designated as hedging instruments. the reduction to oci was mostly attributable to losses of approximately $670 million on cash flow hedges offset by the reclassifications out of oci of the approximately $300 million loss for the time value of options and the approximately $250 million loss for derivative instruments not designated as hedging instruments.  \u00a0 financial condition  \u00a0 the company\u0092s cash and short-term investment portfolio totaled $38.65 billion at june 30, 2002. the portfolio consists primarily of fixed-income securities, diversified among industries and individual issuers. microsoft\u0092s investments are generally liquid and investment grade. the portfolio is invested predominantly in u.s. dollar denominated securities, but also includes foreign currency positions in order to diversify financial risk. the portfolio is primarily invested in short-term securities to minimize interest rate risk and facilitate rapid deployment for immediate cash needs.   \u00a0    "

fiscal 2000, an increase of $1.33 billion from the prior year, reflecting an increase in common stock repurchased versus the prior year. during fiscal 2000, the company repurchased 55.2 million shares. cash used for investing was $9.39 billion in fiscal 2000, a decrease of $808 million from the prior year.  microsoft has no material long-term debt. stockholders\u0092 equity at june 30, 2002 was $52.18 billion. microsoft will continue to invest in sales, marketing, and product support infrastructure. additionally, research and development activities will include investments in existing and advanced areas of technology, including using cash to acquire technology. additions to property and equipment will continue, including new facilities and computer systems for r&d, sales and marketing, support, and administrative staff. commitments for constructing new buildings were $111 million on june 30, 2002. the company has not engaged in any transactions or arrangements with unconsolidated entities or other persons that are reasonably likely to affect materially liquidity or the availability of or requirements for capital resources. since fiscal 1990, microsoft has repurchased 982 million common shares while 2.23 billion shares were issued under the company\u0092s employee stock option and purchase plans. the company\u0092s convertible preferred stock matured on december 15, 1999. each preferred share was converted into 1.1273 common shares.  management believes existing cash and short-term investments together with funds generated from operations should be sufficient to meet operating requirements. the company\u0092s cash and short-term investments are available for strategic investments, mergers and acquisitions, other potential large-scale needs and to fund the share repurchase program. microsoft has not paid cash dividends on its common stock.  \u00a0 subsequent event  \u00a0 on july 11, 2002, microsoft acquired navision a/s as a result of the successful close of a tender offer. microsoft purchased navision\u0092s shares for approximately $1.45 billion in stock and cash. navision is a provider of integrated business software solutions for small and medium-sized companies.  \u00a0 application of critical accounting policies  \u00a0 microsoft\u0092s financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states. preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. these estimates and assumptions are affected by management\u0092s application of accounting policies. critical accounting policies for microsoft include revenue recognition, impairment of investment securities, accounting for research and development costs, accounting for legal contingencies, and accounting for income taxes.  microsoft accounts for the licensing of software in accordance with american institute of certified public accountants (aicpa) statement of position (sop) 97-2, software revenue recognition. the application of sop 97-2 requires judgment, including whether a software arrangement includes multiple elements, and if so, whether vendor-specific objective evidence (vsoe) of fair value exists for those elements. end users receive certain elements of the company\u0092s products over a period of time. these elements include browser technologies updates and technical support, the fair value of which is recognized over the product\u0092s estimated life cycle. changes to the elements in a software arrangement, the ability to identify vsoe for those elements, the fair value of the respective elements, and changes to a product\u0092s estimated life cycle could materially impact the amount of earned and unearned revenue. judgment is also required to assess whether future releases of certain software represent new products or upgrades and enhancements to existing products.  sfas 115, accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities, and securities and exchange commission (sec) staff accounting bulletin (sab) 59, accounting for noncurrent marketable equity securities,  provide guidance on determining when an investment is other-than-temporarily impaired, which also requires judgment. in making this judgment, microsoft evaluates, among other factors, the duration and extent to which the fair value of an investment is less than its cost; the financial health of and business outlook for the investee, including factors such as industry and sector performance, changes in technology, and operational and financing cash flow; and the company\u0092s intent and ability to hold the investment.  microsoft accounts for research and development costs in accordance with several accounting pronouncements, including sfas 2, accounting for research and development costs, and sfas 86, accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold, leased, or other-   \u00a0    "

to expense when incurred as research and development until technological feasibility has been established for the product. once technological feasibility is established, all software costs should be capitalized until the product is available for general release to customers. judgment is required in determining when the technological feasibility of a product is established. microsoft has determined that technological feasibility for its products is reached shortly before the products are released to manufacturing. costs incurred after technological feasibility is established are not material, and accordingly, the company expenses all research and development costs when incurred.  microsoft is subject to various legal proceedings and claims, the outcomes of which are subject to significant uncertainty. sfas 5, accounting for contingencies, requires that an estimated loss from a loss contingency should be accrued by a charge to income if it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. disclosure of a contingency is required if there is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss has been incurred. the company evaluates, among other factors, the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss. changes in these factors could materially impact the company\u0092s financial position or its results of operations.  sfas 109, accounting for income taxes, establishes financial accounting and reporting standards for the effect of income taxes. the objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entity\u0092s financial statements or tax returns. judgment is required in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the company\u0092s financial statements or tax returns. fluctuations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could materially impact the company\u0092s financial position or its results of operations.  \u00a0 issues and uncertainties  \u00a0 the following issues and uncertainties, among others, should be considered in evaluating the company\u0092s financial outlook.  \u00a0 challenges to the company\u0092s business model.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0since its inception, the company\u0092s business model has been based upon customers agreeing to pay a fee to license software developed and distributed by microsoft. under this commercial software development (\u0093csd\u0094) model, software developers bear the costs of converting original ideas into software products through investments in research and development, offsetting these costs with the revenues received from the distribution of their products. the company believes that the csd model has had substantial benefits for users of software, allowing them to rely on the expertise of the company and other software developers that have powerful incentives to develop innovative software that is useful, reliable and compatible with other software and hardware. in recent years, there has been a growing challenge to the csd model, often referred to as the open source movement. under the open source model, software is produced by global \u0093communities\u0094 of programmers, and the resulting software and the intellectual property contained therein is licensed to end users at little or no cost. the company believes that there are significant problems with the open source model, the principal drawback being that no single entity is responsible for the open source software, and thus users have no recourse if a product does not work properly or at all. further, without the market incentives associated with the csd model, the company believes that the vigorous innovation and growth of the software industry over the last 25 years would not have occurred. nonetheless, the popularization of the open source movement continues to pose a significant challenge to the company\u0092s business model, including recent efforts by proponents of the open source model to convince governments worldwide to mandate the use of open source software in their purchase and deployment of software products. to the extent the open source model gains increasing market acceptance, sales of the company\u0092s products may decline, the company may have to reduce the prices it charges for its products, and revenues and operating margins may consequently decline.  \u00a0 new products and services.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0the company has made significant investments in research and development for new products, services and technologies, including microsoft .net, xbox, business applications, msn, mobile and wireless technologies, and television. significant revenue from these investments may not be achieved for a number of years, if at all. moreover, these products and services may never be profitable, and even if they are profitable, operating margins for these businesses are not expected to be as high as the margins historically experienced in our desktop and enterprise software and services businesses.  \u00a0 declines in demand for software.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0if overall market demand for pcs, servers and other computing devices declines significantly, and consumer and corporate spending for such products declines, microsoft\u0092s revenue growth will be adversely affected. additionally, the company\u0092s revenues would be unfavorably impacted if customers reduce their purchases of new software products or upgrades to existing products if such new offerings are not perceived to add significant new functionality or other value to prospective purchasers.  \u00a0 product development schedule.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0the development of software products is a complex and time-consuming process. new products and enhancements to existing products can require long development and testing periods. significant delays in new product releases or significant problems in creating new products could negatively impact the company\u0092s revenues.  \u00a0 international operations.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0microsoft develops and sells products throughout the world. the prices of the company\u0092s products in countries outside of the united states are generally higher than the company\u0092s prices in the united states because of the cost incurred in localizing software for non-u.s. markets. the costs of producing and selling the company\u0092s products in these countries also are higher. pressure to globalize microsoft\u0092s pricing structure might require that the company reduce the sales price of its software in other countries, even though the costs of the software continue to be higher than in the united states. unfavorable changes in trade protection laws, policies and measures, and other regulatory requirements affecting trade and investment; unexpected changes in regulatory requirements for software; social, political, labor, or economic conditions in a specific country or region, including foreign exchange rates; difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations; and potential adverse foreign tax consequences, among other factors, could also have a negative effect on the company\u0092s business and results of operations outside of the united states.   \u00a0    "
