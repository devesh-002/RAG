## Item 1A


The Company continues to monitor the situation and take appropriate actions in accordance with the recommendations and requirements of relevant authorities. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic may impact the Company’s operational and financial performance remains uncertain and will depend on many factors outside the Company’s control, including the timing, extent, trajectory and duration of the pandemic, the emergence of new variants, the development, availability, distribution and effectiveness of vaccines and treatments, the imposition of protective public safety measures, and the impact of the pandemic on the global economy and demand for consumer products and services. Additional future impacts on the Company may include material adverse effects on demand for the Company’s products and services, the Company’s supply chain and sales and distribution channels, the Company’s ability to execute its strategic plans, and the Company’s profitability and cost structure.To the extent the COVID-19 pandemic adversely affects the Company’s business, results of operations, financial condition and stock price, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in this Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K.The Company’s business can be impacted by political events, trade and other international disputes, war, terrorism, natural disasters, public health issues, industrial accidents and other business interruptions.Political events, trade and other international disputes, war, terrorism, natural disasters, public health issues, industrial accidents and other business interruptions can harm or disrupt international commerce and the global economy, and could have a material adverse effect on the Company and its customers, suppliers, contract manufacturers, logistics providers, distributors, cellular network carriers and other channel partners.The Company has a large, global business with sales outside the U.S. representing a majority of the Company’s total net sales, and the Company believes that it generally benefits from growth in international trade. Substantially all of the Company’s manufacturing is performed in whole or in part by outsourcing partners located primarily in Asia, including China mainland, India, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Vietnam. Trade policies and disputes and other international conflicts can result in tariffs, sanctions and other measures that restrict international trade, and can materially adversely affect the Company’s business, particularly if these measures occur in regions where the Company derives a significant portion of its revenues and/or has significant supply chain operations. For example, tensions between the U.S. and China have led to a series of tariffs being imposed by the U.S. on imports from China mainland, as well as other business restrictions. Tariffs increase the cost of the Company’s products and the components and raw materials that go into making them. These increased costs can adversely impact the gross margin that the Company earns on its products. Tariffs can also make the Company’s products more expensive for customers, which could make the Company’s products less competitive and reduce consumer demand. Countries may also adopt other measures, such as controls on imports or exports of goods, technology or data, that could adversely impact the Company’s operations and supply chain and limit the Company’s ability to offer its products and services as designed. These measures can require the Company to take various actions, including changing suppliers, restructuring business relationships, and ceasing to offer third-party applications on its platforms. Changing the Company’s operations in accordance with new or changed trade restrictions can be expensive, time-consuming and disruptive to the Company’s operations. Such restrictions can be announced with little or no advance notice and the Company may not be able to effectively mitigate all adverse impacts from such measures. If disputes and conflicts further escalate in the future, actions by governments in response could be significantly more severe and restrictive and could materially adversely affect the Company’s business. Political uncertainty surrounding trade and other international disputes could also have a negative effect on consumer confidence and spending, which could adversely affect the Company’s business.Many of the Company’s operations and facilities, as well as critical business operations of the Company’s suppliers and contract manufacturers, are in locations that are prone to earthquakes and other natural disasters. In addition, such operations and facilities are subject to the risk of interruption by fire, power shortages, nuclear power plant accidents and other industrial accidents, terrorist attacks and other hostile acts, ransomware and other cybersecurity attacks, labor disputes, public health issues, including pandemics such as the COVID-19 pandemic, and other events beyond the Company’s control. Global climate change is resulting in certain types of natural disasters occurring more frequently or with more intense effects. Such events can make it difficult or impossible for the Company to manufacture and deliver products to its customers, create delays and inefficiencies in the Company’s supply and manufacturing chain, and result in slowdowns and outages to the Company’s service offerings. Following an interruption to its business, the Company can require substantial recovery time, experience significant expenditures to resume operations, and lose significant sales. Because the Company relies on single or limited sources for the supply and manufacture of many critical components, a business interruption affecting such sources would exacerbate any negative consequences to the Company.Apple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 6



The Company’s operations are also subject to the risks of industrial accidents at its suppliers and contract manufacturers. While the Company’s suppliers are required to maintain safe working environments and operations, an industrial accident could occur and could result in serious injuries or loss of life, disruption to the Company’s business, and harm to the Company’s reputation. Major public health issues, including pandemics such as the COVID-19 pandemic, have adversely affected, and could in the future materially adversely affect, the Company due to their impact on the global economy and demand for consumer products; the imposition of protective public safety measures, such as stringent employee travel restrictions and limitations on freight services and the movement of products between regions; and disruptions in the Company’s supply chain and sales and distribution channels, resulting in interruptions of the supply of current products and delays in production ramps of new products.While the Company maintains insurance coverage for certain types of losses, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses that may arise.Global markets for the Company’s products and services are highly competitive and subject to rapid technological change, and the Company may be unable to compete effectively in these markets.The Company’s products and services are offered in highly competitive global markets characterized by aggressive price competition and resulting downward pressure on gross margins, frequent introduction of new products and services, short product life cycles, evolving industry standards, continual improvement in product price and performance characteristics, rapid adoption of technological advancements by competitors, and price sensitivity on the part of consumers and businesses.The Company’s ability to compete successfully depends heavily on ensuring the continuing and timely introduction of innovative new products, services and technologies to the marketplace. The Company designs and develops nearly the entire solution for its products, including the hardware, operating system, numerous software applications and related services. As a result, the Company must make significant investments in R&D. There can be no assurance these investments will achieve expected returns, and the Company may not be able to develop and market new products and services successfully.The Company currently holds a significant number of patents, trademarks and copyrights and has registered, and applied to register, additional patents, trademarks and copyrights. In contrast, many of the Company’s competitors seek to compete primarily through aggressive pricing and very low cost structures, and by imitating the Company’s products and infringing on its intellectual property. Effective intellectual property protection is not consistently available in every country in which the Company operates. If the Company is unable to continue to develop and sell innovative new products with attractive margins or if competitors infringe on the Company’s intellectual property, the Company’s ability to maintain a competitive advantage could be materially adversely affected.The Company has a minority market share in the global smartphone, personal computer and tablet markets. The Company faces substantial competition in these markets from companies that have significant technical, marketing, distribution and other resources, as well as established hardware, software and digital content supplier relationships. In addition, some of the Company’s competitors have broader product lines, lower-priced products and a larger installed base of active devices. Competition has been particularly intense as competitors have aggressively cut prices and lowered product margins. Certain competitors have the resources, experience or cost structures to provide products at little or no profit or even at a loss. Some of the markets in which the Company competes have from time to time experienced little to no growth or contracted overall.Additionally, the Company faces significant competition as competitors imitate the Company’s product features and applications within their products or collaborate to offer solutions that are more competitive than those they currently offer. The Company also expects competition to intensify as competitors imitate the Company’s approach to providing components seamlessly within their offerings or work collaboratively to offer integrated solutions.The Company’s services also face substantial competition, including from companies that have significant resources and experience and have established service offerings with large customer bases. The Company competes with business models that provide content to users for free. The Company also competes with illegitimate means to obtain third-party digital content and applications.The Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition depend substantially on the Company’s ability to continually improve its products and services to maintain their functional and design advantages. There can be no assurance the Company will be able to continue to provide products and services that compete effectively.Apple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 7



Business RisksTo remain competitive and stimulate customer demand, the Company must successfully manage frequent introductions and transitions of products and services.Due to the highly volatile and competitive nature of the markets and industries in which the Company competes, the Company must continually introduce new products, services and technologies, enhance existing products and services, effectively stimulate customer demand for new and upgraded products and services, and successfully manage the transition to these new and upgraded products and services. The success of new product and service introductions depends on a number of factors, including timely and successful development, market acceptance, the Company’s ability to manage the risks associated with production ramp-up issues, the availability of application software for the Company’s products, the effective management of purchase commitments and inventory levels in line with anticipated product demand, the availability of products in appropriate quantities and at expected costs to meet anticipated demand, and the risk that new products and services may have quality or other defects or deficiencies. There can be no assurance the Company will successfully manage future introductions and transitions of products and services.The Company depends on component and product manufacturing and logistical services provided by outsourcing partners, many of which are located outside of the U.S.Substantially all of the Company’s manufacturing is performed in whole or in part by outsourcing partners located primarily in Asia, including China mainland, India, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Vietnam, and a significant concentration of this manufacturing is currently performed by a small number of outsourcing partners, often in single locations. Changes or additions to the Company’s supply chain require considerable time and resources and involve significant risks and uncertainties. The Company has also outsourced much of its transportation and logistics management. While these arrangements can lower operating costs, they also reduce the Company’s direct control over production and distribution. Such diminished control has from time to time and may in the future have an adverse effect on the quality or quantity of products manufactured or services provided, or adversely affect the Company’s flexibility to respond to changing conditions. Although arrangements with these partners may contain provisions for product defect expense reimbursement, the Company generally remains responsible to the consumer for warranty and out-of-warranty service in the event of product defects and experiences unanticipated product defect liabilities from time to time. While the Company relies on its partners to adhere to its supplier code of conduct, violations of the supplier code of conduct occur from time to time and can materially adversely affect the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.The Company relies on single-source outsourcing partners in the U.S., Asia and Europe to supply and manufacture many components, and on outsourcing partners primarily located in Asia, for final assembly of substantially all of the Company’s hardware products. Any failure of these partners to perform can have a negative impact on the Company’s cost or supply of components or finished goods. In addition, manufacturing or logistics in these locations or transit to final destinations can be disrupted for a variety of reasons, including natural and man-made disasters, information technology system failures, commercial disputes, armed conflict, economic, business, labor, environmental, public health or political issues, or international trade disputes.The Company has invested in manufacturing process equipment, much of which is held at certain of its outsourcing partners, and has made prepayments to certain of its suppliers associated with long-term supply agreements. While these arrangements help ensure the supply of components and finished goods, if these outsourcing partners or suppliers experience severe financial problems or other disruptions in their business, such continued supply can be reduced or terminated, and the recoverability of manufacturing process equipment or prepayments can be negatively impacted.Future operating results depend upon the Company’s ability to obtain components in sufficient quantities on commercially reasonable terms.Because the Company currently obtains certain components from single or limited sources, the Company is subject to significant supply and pricing risks. Many components, including those that are available from multiple sources, are at times subject to industry-wide shortages and significant commodity pricing fluctuations that can materially adversely affect the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition. For example, the global semiconductor industry is experiencing high demand and shortages of supply, which has adversely affected, and could materially adversely affect, the Company’s ability to obtain sufficient quantities of components and products on commercially reasonable terms or at all. While the Company has entered into agreements for the supply of many components, there can be no assurance the Company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms, or at all. Component suppliers may suffer from poor financial conditions, which can lead to business failure for the supplier or consolidation within a particular industry, further limiting the Company’s ability to obtain sufficient quantities of components on commercially reasonable terms or at all. The effects of global or regional economic conditions on the Company’s suppliers, described in “The Company’s operations and performance depend significantly on global and regional economic conditions and adverse economic conditions can materially adversely affect the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition,” above, can also affect the Company’s ability to obtain components. Therefore, the Company remains subject to significant risks of supply shortages and price increases that can materially adversely affect its business, results of operations and financial condition.Apple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 8



The Company’s new products often utilize custom components available from only one source. When a component or product uses new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers’ yields have matured or their manufacturing capacities have increased. The continued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at all, can be affected for any number of reasons, including if suppliers decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the Company’s requirements. When the Company’s supply of components for a new or existing product has been delayed or constrained, or when an outsourcing partner has delayed shipments of completed products to the Company, the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition have been adversely affected and future delays or constraints could materially adversely affect the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition. The Company’s business and financial performance could also be materially adversely affected depending on the time required to obtain sufficient quantities from the source, or to identify and obtain sufficient quantities from an alternative source.The Company’s products and services may be affected from time to time by design and manufacturing defects that could materially adversely affect the Company’s business and result in harm to the Company’s reputation.The Company offers complex hardware and software products and services that can be affected by design and manufacturing defects. Sophisticated operating system software and applications, such as those offered by the Company, often have issues that can unexpectedly interfere with the intended operation of hardware or software products. Defects can also exist in components and products the Company purchases from third parties. Component defects could make the Company’s products unsafe and create a risk of environmental or property damage and personal injury. These risks may increase as the Company’s products are introduced into specialized applications, including health. In addition, the Company’s service offerings can have quality issues and from time to time experience outages, service slowdowns or errors. As a result, the Company’s services from time to time have not performed as anticipated and may not meet customer expectations. There can be no assurance the Company will be able to detect and fix all issues and defects in the hardware, software and services it offers. Failure to do so can result in widespread technical and performance issues affecting the Company’s products and services. In addition, the Company can be exposed to product liability claims, recalls, product replacements or modifications, write-offs of inventory, property, plant and equipment, and/or intangible assets, and significant warranty and other expenses, including litigation costs and regulatory fines. Quality problems can also adversely affect the experience for users of the Company’s products and services, and result in harm to the Company’s reputation, loss of competitive advantage, poor market acceptance, reduced demand for products and services, delay in new product and service introductions and lost sales.The Company is exposed to the risk of write-downs on the value of its inventory and other assets, in addition to purchase commitment cancellation risk.The Company records a write-down for product and component inventories that have become obsolete or exceed anticipated demand, or for which cost exceeds net realizable value. The Company also accrues necessary cancellation fee reserves for orders of excess products and components. The Company reviews long-lived assets, including capital assets held at its suppliers’ facilities and inventory prepayments, for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate the assets may not be recoverable. If the Company determines that an impairment has occurred, it records a write-down equal to the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value. Although the Company believes its inventory, capital assets, inventory prepayments and other assets and purchase commitments are currently recoverable, there can be no assurance the Company will not incur write-downs, fees, impairments and other charges given the rapid and unpredictable pace of product obsolescence in the industries in which the Company competes.The Company orders components for its products and builds inventory in advance of product announcements and shipments. Manufacturing purchase obligations cover the Company’s forecasted component and manufacturing requirements, typically for periods up to 150 days. Because the Company’s markets are volatile, competitive and subject to rapid technology and price changes, there is a risk the Company will forecast incorrectly and order or produce excess or insufficient amounts of components or products, or not fully utilize firm purchase commitments.The Company relies on access to third-party intellectual property, which may not be available to the Company on commercially reasonable terms or at all.The Company’s products and services are designed to include intellectual property owned by third parties, which requires licenses from those third parties. In addition, because of technological changes in the industries in which the Company currently competes or in the future may compete, current extensive patent coverage and the rapid rate of issuance of new patents, the Company’s products and services can unknowingly infringe existing patents or intellectual property rights of others. From time to time, the Company has been notified that it may be infringing certain patents or other intellectual property rights of third parties. Based on experience and industry practice, the Company believes licenses to such third-party intellectual property can generally be obtained on commercially reasonable terms. However, there can be no assurance the necessary licenses can be obtained on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Failure to obtain the right to use third-party intellectual property, or to use such intellectual property on commercially reasonable terms, can preclude the Company from selling certain products or services, or otherwise have a material adverse impact on the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition.Apple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 9



The Company’s future performance depends in part on support from third-party software developers.The Company believes decisions by customers to purchase its hardware products depend in part on the availability of third-party software applications and services. There can be no assurance third-party developers will continue to develop and maintain software applications and services for the Company’s products. If third-party software applications and services cease to be developed and maintained for the Company’s products, customers may choose not to buy the Company’s products.The Company believes the availability of third-party software applications and services for its products depends in part on the developers’ perception and analysis of the relative benefits of developing, maintaining and upgrading such software and services for the Company’s products compared to competitors’ platforms, such as Android for smartphones and tablets, Windows for personal computers and tablets, and PlayStation, Nintendo and Xbox for gaming platforms. This analysis may be based on factors such as the market position of the Company and its products, the anticipated revenue that may be generated, expected future growth of product sales, and the costs of developing such applications and services.The Company’s minority market share in the global smartphone, personal computer and tablet markets can make developers less inclined to develop or upgrade software for the Company’s products and more inclined to devote their resources to developing and upgrading software for competitors’ products with larger market share. When developers focus their efforts on these competing platforms, the availability and quality of applications for the Company’s devices can suffer.The Company relies on the continued availability and development of compelling and innovative software applications for its products. The Company’s products and operating systems are subject to rapid technological change, and when third-party developers are unable to or choose not to keep up with this pace of change, their applications can fail to take advantage of these changes to deliver improved customer experiences and can operate incorrectly and can result in dissatisfied customers.The Company distributes third-party applications for its products through the App Store. For the vast majority of applications, developers keep all of the revenue they generate on the App Store. The Company only retains a commission from sales of applications and sales of digital services or goods within an application. From time to time, the Company has made changes to its App Store, including actions taken in response to competition, market and legal conditions. The Company may make further business changes in the future. New legislative initiatives, such as the European Union (“EU”) Digital Markets Act, could require further changes. The Company is also subject to litigation and investigations relating to the App Store, which have resulted in changes to the Company’s business practices, and may in the future result in further changes. These changes could include how and to what extent the Company charges developers for access to its platforms and manages distribution of apps outside of the App Store. This could reduce the volume of sales, and the commission that the Company earns on those sales, would decrease. If the rate of the commission that the Company retains on such sales is reduced, or if it is otherwise narrowed in scope or eliminated, the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.Failure to obtain or create digital content that appeals to the Company’s customers, or to make such content available on commercially reasonable terms, could have a material adverse impact on the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition.The Company contracts with numerous third parties to offer their digital content to customers. This includes the right to sell, or offer subscriptions to, third-party content, as well as the right to incorporate specific content into the Company’s own services. The licensing or other distribution arrangements for this content can be for relatively short time periods and do not guarantee the continuation or renewal of these arrangements on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Some third-party content providers and distributors currently or in the future may offer competing products and services, and can take actions to make it difficult or impossible for the Company to license or otherwise distribute their content. Other content owners, providers or distributors may seek to limit the Company’s access to, or increase the cost of, such content. The Company may be unable to continue to offer a wide variety of content at commercially reasonable prices with acceptable usage rules.The Company also produces its own digital content, which can be costly to produce due to intense and increasing competition for talent, content and subscribers, and may fail to appeal to the Company’s customers. The COVID-19 pandemic has also caused additional restrictions on production and increased costs for digital content.Some third-party digital content providers require the Company to provide digital rights management and other security solutions. If requirements change, the Company may have to develop or license new technology to provide these solutions. There can be no assurance the Company will be able to develop or license such solutions at a reasonable cost and in a timely manner.Apple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 10



The Company’s success depends largely on the talents and efforts of its team members, the continued service and availability of highly skilled employees, including key personnel, and the Company’s ability to nurture its distinctive and inclusive culture.Much of the Company’s future success depends on the talents and efforts of its team members, the continued availability and service of key personnel, including its Chief Executive Officer, executive team and other highly skilled employees. Experienced personnel in the technology industry are in high demand and competition for their talents is intense, especially in Silicon Valley, where most of the Company’s key personnel are located. In addition to intense competition for talent, workforce dynamics are constantly evolving. If the Company does not manage changing workforce dynamics effectively, it could materially adversely affect the Company’s culture, reputation and operational flexibility.The Company believes that its distinctive and inclusive culture is a significant driver of its success. If the Company is unable to nurture its culture, it could materially adversely affect the Company’s ability to recruit and retain the highly skilled employees who are critical to its success, and could otherwise materially adversely affect the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.The Company depends on the performance of carriers, wholesalers, retailers and other resellers.The Company distributes its products and certain of its services through cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers and resellers, many of which distribute products and services from competitors. The Company also sells its products and services and resells third-party products in most of its major markets directly to consumers, small and mid-sized businesses, and education, enterprise and government customers through its retail and online stores and its direct sales force.Some carriers providing cellular network service for the Company’s products offer financing, installment payment plans or subsidies for users’ purchases of the device. There can be no assurance such offers will be continued at all or in the same amounts.The Company has invested and will continue to invest in programs to enhance reseller sales, including staffing selected resellers’ stores with Company employees and contractors, and improving product placement displays. These programs can require a substantial investment while not assuring return or incremental sales. The financial condition of these resellers could weaken, these resellers could stop distributing the Company’s products, or uncertainty regarding demand for some or all of the Company’s products could cause resellers to reduce their ordering and marketing of the Company’s products.The Company’s business and reputation are impacted by information technology system failures and network disruptions.The Company and its global supply chain are exposed to information technology system failures or network disruptions caused by natural disasters, accidents, power disruptions, telecommunications failures, acts of terrorism or war, computer viruses, physical or electronic break-ins, ransomware or other cybersecurity incidents, or other events or disruptions. System redundancy and other continuity measures may be ineffective or inadequate, and the Company’s or its vendors’ business continuity and disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities. Such failures or disruptions can adversely impact the Company’s business by, among other things, preventing access to the Company’s online services, interfering with customer transactions or impeding the manufacturing and shipping of the Company’s products. These events could materially adversely affect the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.Losses or unauthorized access to or releases of confidential information, including personal information, could subject the Company to significant reputational, financial, legal and operational consequences.The Company’s business requires it to use and store confidential information, including personal information, with respect to the Company’s customers and employees. The Company devotes significant resources to network and data security, including through the use of encryption and other security measures intended to protect its systems and data. But these measures cannot provide absolute security, and losses or unauthorized access to or releases of confidential information occur and could materially adversely affect the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.The Company’s business also requires it to share confidential information with suppliers and other third parties. The Company relies on global suppliers that are also exposed to ransomware and other malicious attacks that can disrupt business operations. Although the Company takes steps to secure confidential information that is provided to or accessible by third parties working on the Company’s behalf, such measures are not always effective and losses or unauthorized access to or releases of confidential information occur. Such incidents and other malicious attacks could materially adversely affect the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.Apple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 11



The Company experiences malicious attacks and other attempts to gain unauthorized access to its systems on a regular basis. These attacks seek to compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of confidential information or disrupt normal business operations, and could, among other things, impair the Company’s ability to attract and retain customers for its products and services, impact the Company’s stock price, materially damage commercial relationships, and expose the Company to litigation or government investigations, which could result in penalties, fines or judgments against the Company. Globally, attacks are expected to continue accelerating in both frequency and sophistication with increasing use by actors of tools and techniques that are designed to circumvent controls, avoid detection, and remove or obfuscate forensic evidence, all of which hinders the Company’s ability to identify, investigate and recover from incidents. In addition, attacks against the Company and its customers can escalate during periods of severe diplomatic or armed conflict.Although malicious attacks perpetrated to gain access to confidential information, including personal information, affect many companies across various industries, the Company is at a relatively greater risk of being targeted because of its high profile and the value of the confidential information it creates, owns, manages, stores and processes.The Company has implemented systems and processes intended to secure its information technology systems and prevent unauthorized access to or loss of sensitive data, and mitigate the impact of unauthorized access, including through the use of encryption and authentication technologies. As with all companies, these security measures may not be sufficient for all eventualities and may be vulnerable to hacking, ransomware attacks, employee error, malfeasance, system error, faulty password management or other irregularities. For example, third parties can fraudulently induce the Company’s or its vendors’ employees or customers into disclosing user names, passwords or other sensitive information, which can, in turn, be used for unauthorized access to the Company’s or its vendors’ systems and services. To help protect customers and the Company, the Company deploys and makes available technologies like multifactor authentication, monitors its services and systems for unusual activity and may freeze accounts under suspicious circumstances, which, among other things, can result in the delay or loss of customer orders or impede customer access to the Company’s products and services.While the Company maintains insurance coverage that is intended to address certain aspects of data security risks, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise.Investment in new business strategies and acquisitions could disrupt the Company’s ongoing business, present risks not originally contemplated and materially adversely affect the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.The Company has invested, and in the future may invest, in new business strategies or acquisitions. Such endeavors may involve significant risks and uncertainties, including distraction of management from current operations, greater-than-expected liabilities and expenses, economic, political, legal and regulatory challenges associated with operating in new businesses, regions or countries, inadequate return on capital, potential impairment of tangible and intangible assets, and significant write-offs. Investment and acquisition transactions are exposed to additional risks, including failing to obtain required regulatory approvals on a timely basis or at all, or the imposition of onerous conditions that could delay or prevent the Company from completing a transaction or otherwise limit the Company’s ability to fully realize the anticipated benefits of a transaction. These new ventures are inherently risky and may not be successful. The failure of any significant investment could materially adversely affect the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.The Company’s retail stores have required and will continue to require a substantial investment and commitment of resources and are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties.The Company’s retail stores have required substantial investment in equipment and leasehold improvements, information systems, inventory and personnel. The Company also has entered into substantial lease commitments for retail space. Certain stores have been designed and built to serve as high-profile venues to promote brand awareness. Because of their unique design elements, locations and size, these stores require substantially more investment than the Company’s more typical retail stores. Due to the high cost structure associated with the Company’s retail stores, a decline in sales or the closure or poor performance of an individual store or multiple stores, including as a result of protective public safety measures in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, could result in significant lease termination costs, write-offs of equipment and leasehold improvements and severance costs.The Company’s retail operations are subject to many factors that pose risks and uncertainties and could adversely impact the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition, including macro-economic factors that could have an adverse effect on general retail activity. Other factors include the Company’s ability to: manage costs associated with retail store construction and operation; manage relationships with existing retail partners; manage costs associated with fluctuations in the value of retail inventory; and obtain and renew leases in quality retail locations at a reasonable cost.Apple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 12



Legal and Regulatory Compliance RisksThe Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely impacted by unfavorable results of legal proceedings or government investigations.The Company is subject to various claims, legal proceedings and government investigations that have arisen in the ordinary course of business and have not yet been fully resolved, and new matters may arise in the future. In addition, agreements entered into by the Company sometimes include indemnification provisions which can subject the Company to costs and damages in the event of a claim against an indemnified third party. The number of claims, legal proceedings and government investigations involving the Company, and the alleged magnitude of such claims, proceedings and government investigations, has generally increased over time and may continue to increase.The Company has faced and continues to face a significant number of patent claims relating to its cellular-enabled products, and new claims may arise in the future. For example, technology and other patent-holding companies frequently assert their patents and seek royalties and often enter into litigation based on allegations of patent infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. The Company is vigorously defending infringement actions in courts in several U.S. jurisdictions, as well as internationally in various countries. The plaintiffs in these actions frequently seek injunctions and substantial damages.Regardless of the merit of particular claims, defending against litigation or responding to government investigations can be expensive, time-consuming and disruptive to the Company’s operations. In recognition of these considerations, the Company may enter into agreements or other arrangements to settle litigation and resolve such challenges. There can be no assurance such agreements can be obtained on acceptable terms or that litigation will not occur. These agreements can also significantly increase the Company’s cost of sales and operating expenses and require the Company to change its business practices and limit the Company’s ability to offer certain products and services.Except as described in Part I, Item 3 of this Form 10-K under the heading “Legal Proceedings” and in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Note 10, “Commitments and Contingencies” under the heading “Contingencies,” in the opinion of management, there was not at least a reasonable possibility the Company may have incurred a material loss, or a material loss greater than a recorded accrual, concerning loss contingencies for asserted legal and other claims.The outcome of litigation or government investigations is inherently uncertain. If one or more legal matters were resolved against the Company or an indemnified third party in a reporting period for amounts above management’s expectations, the Company’s results of operations and financial condition for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected. Further, such an outcome can result in significant compensatory, punitive or trebled monetary damages, disgorgement of revenue or profits, remedial corporate measures or injunctive relief against the Company, and can require the Company to change its business practices and limit the Company’s ability to offer certain products and services, all of which could materially adversely affect the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.While the Company maintains insurance coverage for certain types of claims, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise.The Company is subject to complex and changing laws and regulations worldwide, which exposes the Company to potential liabilities, increased costs and other adverse effects on the Company’s business.The Company’s global operations are subject to complex and changing laws and regulations on subjects, including antitrust; privacy, data security and data localization; consumer protection; advertising, sales, billing and e-commerce; financial services and technology; product liability; intellectual property ownership and infringement; digital platforms; internet, telecommunications, and mobile communications; media, television, film and digital content; availability of third-party software applications and services; labor and employment; anticorruption; import, export and trade; foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions; anti–money laundering; foreign ownership and investment; tax; and environmental, health and safety, including electronic waste, recycling, and climate change.Apple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 13



Compliance with these laws and regulations is onerous and expensive. New and changing laws and regulations can adversely affect the Company’s business by increasing the Company’s costs, limiting the Company’s ability to offer a product, service or feature to customers, impacting customer demand for the Company’s products and services, and requiring changes to the Company’s supply chain and its business. New and changing laws and regulations can also create uncertainty about how such laws and regulations will be interpreted and applied. These risks and costs may increase as the Company’s products and services are introduced into specialized applications, including health and financial services. The Company has implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations, but there can be no assurance the Company’s employees, contractors or agents will not violate such laws and regulations or the Company’s policies and procedures. If the Company is found to have violated laws and regulations, it could materially adversely affect the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition. Regulatory changes and other actions that materially adversely affect the Company’s business may be announced with little or no advance notice and the Company may not be able to effectively mitigate all adverse impacts from such measures. For example, the Company is subject to changing regulations relating to the export and import of its products. Although the Company has programs, policies and procedures in place that are designed to satisfy regulatory requirements, there can be no assurance that such policies and procedures will be effective in preventing a violation or a claim of a violation. As a result, the Company’s products could be delayed or prohibited from importation, either of which could materially adversely affect the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.Expectations relating to environmental, social and governance considerations expose the Company to potential liabilities, increased costs, reputational harm, and other adverse effects on the Company’s business. Many governments, regulators, investors, employees, customers and other stakeholders are increasingly focused on environmental, social and governance considerations relating to businesses, including climate change and greenhouse gas emissions, human and civil rights, and diversity, equity and inclusion. In addition, the Company makes statements about its environmental, social and governance goals and initiatives through its environmental, social and governance report, its other non-financial reports, information provided on its website, press statements and other communications. Responding to these environmental, social and governance considerations and implementation of these goals and initiatives involves risks and uncertainties, requires investments, and depends in part on third-party performance or data that is outside the Company’s control. The Company cannot guarantee that it will achieve its announced environmental, social and governance goals and initiatives. In addition, some stakeholders may disagree with the Company’s goals and initiatives. Any failure, or perceived failure, by the Company to achieve its goals, further its initiatives, adhere to its public statements, comply with federal, state or international environmental, social and governance laws and regulations, or meet evolving and varied stakeholder expectations and standards could result in legal and regulatory proceedings against the Company and materially adversely affect the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and stock price.The technology industry, including, in some instances, the Company, is subject to intense media, political and regulatory scrutiny, which exposes the Company to increasing regulation, government investigations, legal actions and penalties. From time to time, the Company has made changes to its App Store, including actions taken in response to competition, market and legal conditions. The Company may make further business changes in the future. New legislative initiatives, such as the EU Digital Markets Act, or similar laws in other jurisdictions, could require further changes. These changes could include how and to what extent the Company charges developers for access to its platforms and manages distribution of apps outside of the App Store.The Company is also currently subject to antitrust investigations in various jurisdictions around the world, which can result in legal proceedings and claims against the Company that could, individually or in the aggregate, have a materially adverse impact on the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition. For example, the Company is the subject of investigations in Europe and other jurisdictions relating to App Store terms and conditions. If such investigations result in adverse findings against the Company, the Company could be exposed to significant fines and may be required to make changes to its App Store business, all of which could materially adversely affect the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition. The Company is also subject to litigation relating to the App Store, which has resulted in changes to the Company’s business practices, and may in the future result in further changes.Further, the Company has commercial relationships with other companies in the technology industry that are or may become subject to investigations and litigation that, if resolved against those other companies, could materially adversely affect the Company’s commercial relationships with those business partners and materially adversely affect the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition. For example, the Company earns revenue from licensing arrangements with other companies to offer their search services on the Company’s platforms and apps, and certain of these arrangements are currently subject to government investigations and legal proceedings.Apple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 14



There can be no assurance the Company’s business will not be materially adversely affected, individually or in the aggregate, by the outcomes of such investigations, litigation or changes to laws and regulations in the future. Changes to the Company’s business practices to comply with new laws and regulations or in connection with other legal proceedings could negatively impact the reputation of the Company’s products for privacy and security and otherwise adversely affect the experience for users of the Company’s products and services, and result in harm to the Company’s reputation, loss of competitive advantage, poor market acceptance, reduced demand for products and services, and lost sales.The Company’s business is subject to a variety of U.S. and international laws, rules, policies and other obligations regarding data protection.The Company is subject to federal, state and international laws relating to the collection, use, retention, security and transfer of various types of personal information. In many cases, these laws apply not only to third-party transactions, but also restrict transfers of personal information among the Company and its international subsidiaries. Several jurisdictions have passed laws in this area, and additional jurisdictions are considering imposing additional restrictions or have laws that are pending. These laws continue to develop and may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Complying with emerging and changing requirements causes the Company to incur substantial costs and has required and may in the future require the Company to change its business practices. Noncompliance could result in significant penalties or legal liability.The Company makes statements about its use and disclosure of personal information through its privacy policy, information provided on its website, press statements and other privacy notices provided to customers. Any failure by the Company to comply with these public statements or with other federal, state or international privacy or data protection laws and regulations could result in inquiries or proceedings against the Company by governmental entities or others. In addition to reputational impacts, penalties could include ongoing audit requirements and significant legal liability.In addition to the risks generally relating to the collection, use, retention, security and transfer of personal information, the Company is also subject to specific obligations relating to information considered sensitive under applicable laws, such as health data, financial data and biometric data. Health data and financial data are subject to additional privacy, security and breach notification requirements, and the Company is subject to audit by governmental authorities regarding the Company’s compliance with these obligations. If the Company fails to adequately comply with these rules and requirements, or if health data or financial data is handled in a manner not permitted by law or under the Company’s agreements with healthcare or financial institutions, the Company can be subject to litigation or government investigations, and can be liable for associated investigatory expenses, and can also incur significant fees or fines.Payment card data is also subject to additional requirements. Under payment card rules and obligations, if cardholder information is potentially compromised, the Company can be liable for associated investigatory expenses and can also incur significant fees or fines if the Company fails to follow payment card industry data security standards. The Company could also experience a significant increase in payment card transaction costs or lose the ability to process payment cards if it fails to follow payment card industry data security standards, which could materially adversely affect the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.Financial RisksThe Company expects its quarterly net sales and results of operations to fluctuate.The Company’s profit margins vary across its products, services, geographic segments and distribution channels. For example, the gross margins on the Company’s products and services vary significantly and can change over time. The Company’s gross margins are subject to volatility and downward pressure due to a variety of factors, including: continued industry-wide global product pricing pressures and product pricing actions that the Company may take in response to such pressures; increased competition; the Company’s ability to effectively stimulate demand for certain of its products and services; compressed product life cycles; supply shortages; potential increases in the cost of components, outside manufacturing services, and developing, acquiring and delivering content for the Company’s services; the Company’s ability to manage product quality and warranty costs effectively; shifts in the mix of products and services, or in the geographic, currency or channel mix, including to the extent that regulatory changes require the Company to modify its product and service offerings; fluctuations in foreign exchange rates; inflation and other macroeconomic pressures; and the introduction of new products or services, including new products or services with higher cost structures. These and other factors could have a materially adverse impact on the Company’s results of operations and financial condition.The Company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its fiscal year due in part to seasonal holiday demand. Additionally, new product and service introductions can significantly impact net sales, cost of sales and operating expenses. Further, the Company generates a significant portion of its net sales from a single product and a decline in demand for that product could significantly impact quarterly net sales. The Company could also be subject to unexpected developments, such as lower-than-anticipated demand for the Company’s products or services, issues with new product or service introductions, information technology system failures or network disruptions, or failure of one of the Company’s logistics, components supply, or manufacturing partners.Apple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 15



The Company’s financial performance is subject to risks associated with changes in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to local currencies.The Company’s primary exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates relates to non–U.S. dollar–denominated sales, cost of sales and operating expenses worldwide. Gross margins on the Company’s products in foreign countries and on products that include components obtained from foreign suppliers could be materially adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.The weakening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar adversely affects the U.S. dollar value of the Company’s foreign currency–denominated sales and earnings, and generally leads the Company to raise international pricing, potentially reducing demand for the Company’s products. In some circumstances, for competitive or other reasons, the Company may decide not to raise international pricing to offset the U.S. dollar’s strengthening, which would adversely affect the U.S. dollar value of the gross margins the Company earns on foreign currency–denominated sales.Conversely, a strengthening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, while generally beneficial to the Company’s foreign currency–denominated sales and earnings, could cause the Company to reduce international pricing and incur losses on its foreign currency derivative instruments, thereby limiting the benefit. Additionally, strengthening of foreign currencies may increase the Company’s cost of product components denominated in those currencies, thus adversely affecting gross margins.The Company uses derivative instruments, such as foreign currency forward and option contracts, to hedge certain exposures to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. The use of such hedging activities may not be effective to offset any, or more than a portion, of the adverse financial effects of unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates over the limited time the hedges are in place.The Company is exposed to credit risk and fluctuations in the values of its investment portfolio.The Company’s investments can be negatively affected by changes in liquidity, credit deterioration, financial results, market and economic conditions, political risk, sovereign risk, interest rate fluctuations or other factors. As a result, the value and liquidity of the Company’s cash, cash equivalents, and marketable and non-marketable securities may fluctuate substantially. Therefore, although the Company has not realized any significant losses on its cash, cash equivalents, and marketable and non-marketable securities, future fluctuations in their value could result in significant losses and could have a material adverse impact on the Company’s results of operations and financial condition.The Company is exposed to credit risk on its trade accounts receivable, vendor non-trade receivables and prepayments related to long-term supply agreements, and this risk is heightened during periods when economic conditions worsen.The Company distributes its products and certain of its services through third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers and resellers. The Company also sells its products and services directly to small and mid-sized businesses and education, enterprise and government customers. A substantial majority of the Company’s outstanding trade receivables are not covered by collateral, third-party bank support or financing arrangements, or credit insurance, and a significant portion of the Company’s trade receivables can be concentrated within cellular network carriers or other resellers. The Company’s exposure to credit and collectibility risk on its trade receivables is higher in certain international markets and its ability to mitigate such risks may be limited. The Company also has unsecured vendor non-trade receivables resulting from purchases of components by outsourcing partners and other vendors that manufacture subassemblies or assemble final products for the Company. In addition, the Company has made prepayments associated with long-term supply agreements to secure supply of inventory components. As of September 24, 2022, the Company’s vendor non-trade receivables and prepayments related to long-term supply agreements were concentrated among a few individual vendors located primarily in Asia. While the Company has procedures to monitor and limit exposure to credit risk on its trade and vendor non-trade receivables, as well as long-term prepayments, there can be no assurance such procedures will effectively limit its credit risk and avoid losses.The Company is subject to changes in tax rates, the adoption of new U.S. or international tax legislation and exposure to additional tax liabilities.The Company is subject to taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions, including Ireland, where a number of the Company’s subsidiaries are organized. Due to economic and political conditions, tax laws and tax rates for income taxes and other non-income taxes in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change. The Company’s effective tax rates are affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, the introduction of new taxes, or changes in tax laws or their interpretation, including in the U.S. and Ireland. The application of tax laws may be uncertain, require significant judgment and be subject to differing interpretations.Apple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 16

The Company’s reportable segments consist of the Americas, Europe, Greater China, Japan and Rest of Asia Pacific. Americas includes both North and South America. Europe includes European countries, as well as India, the Middle East and Africa. Greater China includes China mainland, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Rest of Asia Pacific includes Australia and those Asian countries not included in the Company’s other reportable segments. Although the reportable segments provide similar hardware and software products and similar services, each one is managed separately to better align with the location of the Company’s customers and distribution partners and the unique market dynamics of each geographic region. Further information regarding the Company’s reportable segments can be found in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Note 11, “Segment Information and Geographic Data.”The following table shows net sales by reportable segment for 2022, 2021 and 2020 (dollars in millions):AmericasAmericas net sales increased during 2022 compared to 2021 due primarily to higher net sales of iPhone, Services and Mac.EuropeEurope net sales increased during 2022 compared to 2021 due primarily to higher net sales of iPhone and Services.

The Company’s effective tax rate for 2021 was lower than the statutory federal income tax rate due primarily to a lower effective tax rate on foreign earnings, tax benefits from share-based compensation and foreign-derived intangible income deductions.The Company’s effective tax rate for 2022 was higher compared to 2021 due primarily to a higher effective tax rate on foreign earnings, including the impact to U.S. foreign tax credits as a result of regulatory guidance issued by the U.S. Department of the Treasury in 2022, and lower tax benefits from foreign-derived intangible income deductions and share-based compensation.Liquidity and Capital ResourcesThe Company believes its balances of cash, cash equivalents and unrestricted marketable securities, which totaled $156.4 billion as of September 24, 2022, along with cash generated by ongoing operations and continued access to debt markets, will be sufficient to satisfy its cash requirements and capital return program over the next 12 months and beyond.The Company’s material cash requirements include the following contractual obligations.DebtAs of September 24, 2022, the Company had outstanding fixed-rate notes with varying maturities for an aggregate principal amount of $111.8 billion (collectively the “Notes”), with $11.1 billion payable within 12 months. Future interest payments associated with the Notes total $41.3 billion, with $2.9 billion payable within 12 months.The Company also issues unsecured short-term promissory notes (“Commercial Paper”) pursuant to a commercial paper program. As of September 24, 2022, the Company had $10.0 billion of Commercial Paper outstanding, all of which was payable within 12 months.LeasesThe Company has lease arrangements for certain equipment and facilities, including corporate, data center, manufacturing and retail space. As of September 24, 2022, the Company had fixed lease payment obligations of $15.3 billion, with $2.0 billion payable within 12 months.Apple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 24



Manufacturing Purchase ObligationsThe Company utilizes several outsourcing partners to manufacture subassemblies for the Company’s products and to perform final assembly and testing of finished products. The Company also obtains individual components for its products from a wide variety of individual suppliers. Outsourcing partners acquire components and build product based on demand information supplied by the Company, which typically covers periods up to 150 days. As of September 24, 2022, the Company had manufacturing purchase obligations of $71.1 billion, with $68.4 billion payable within 12 months. The Company’s manufacturing purchase obligations are primarily noncancelable.Other Purchase ObligationsThe Company’s other purchase obligations primarily consist of noncancelable obligations to acquire capital assets, including assets related to product manufacturing, and noncancelable obligations related to internet services and content creation. As of September 24, 2022, the Company had other purchase obligations of $17.8 billion, with $6.8 billion payable within 12 months.Deemed Repatriation Tax PayableAs of September 24, 2022, the balance of the deemed repatriation tax payable imposed by the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the “Act”) was $22.0 billion, with $5.3 billion expected to be paid within 12 months.In addition to its contractual cash requirements, the Company has a capital return program authorized by the Board of Directors. The Program does not obligate the Company to acquire a minimum amount of shares. As of September 24, 2022, the Company’s quarterly cash dividend was $0.23 per share. The Company intends to increase its dividend on an annual basis, subject to declaration by the Board of Directors.Critical Accounting EstimatesThe preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) and the Company’s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and operating results require the Company’s management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported. Note 1, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Company’s consolidated financial statements. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities.Uncertain Tax PositionsThe Company is subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. The evaluation of the Company’s uncertain tax positions involves significant judgment in the interpretation and application of GAAP and complex domestic and international tax laws, including the Act and matters related to the allocation of international taxation rights between countries. Although management believes the Company’s reserves are reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final outcome of these uncertainties will not be different from that which is reflected in the Company’s reserves. Reserves are adjusted considering changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax examination. Resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with management’s expectations could have a material impact on the Company’s financial condition and operating results.Legal and Other ContingenciesThe Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business, the outcomes of which are inherently uncertain. The Company records a liability when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable, the determination of which requires significant judgment. Resolution of legal matters in a manner inconsistent with management’s expectations could have a material impact on the Company’s financial condition and operating results.Apple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 25


## Item 7A


To provide an assessment of the foreign currency risk associated with certain of the Company’s foreign currency derivative positions, the Company performed a sensitivity analysis using a value-at-risk (“VAR”) model to assess the potential impact of fluctuations in exchange rates. The VAR model consisted of using a Monte Carlo simulation to generate thousands of random market price paths assuming normal market conditions. The VAR is the maximum expected loss in fair value, for a given confidence interval, to the Company’s foreign currency derivative positions due to adverse movements in rates. The VAR model is not intended to represent actual losses but is used as a risk estimation and management tool. Forecasted transactions, firm commitments and assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies were excluded from the model. Based on the results of the model, the Company estimates with 95% confidence, a maximum one-day loss in fair value of $1.0 billion as of September 24, 2022, compared to a maximum one-day loss in fair value of $550 million as of September 25, 2021. Because the Company uses foreign currency instruments for hedging purposes, the losses in fair value incurred on those instruments are generally offset by increases in the fair value of the underlying exposures.Actual future gains and losses associated with the Company’s investment portfolio, debt and derivative positions may differ materially from the sensitivity analyses performed as of September 24, 2022 due to the inherent limitations associated with predicting the timing and amount of changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and the Company’s actual exposures and positions.Apple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 27

Apple Inc.CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS(In millions)See accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.Apple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 33



Apple Inc.Notes to Consolidated Financial StatementsNote 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting PoliciesBasis of Presentation and PreparationThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Apple Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries (collectively “Apple” or the “Company”). Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates. Certain prior period amounts in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been reclassified to conform to the current period’s presentation.The Company’s fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week period that ends on the last Saturday of September. An additional week is included in the first fiscal quarter every five or six years to realign the Company’s fiscal quarters with calendar quarters, which will occur in the first quarter of the Company’s fiscal year ending September 30, 2023. The Company’s fiscal years 2022, 2021 and 2020 spanned 52 weeks each. Unless otherwise stated, references to particular years, quarters, months and periods refer to the Company’s fiscal years ended in September and the associated quarters, months and periods of those fiscal years.Revenue RecognitionNet sales consist of revenue from the sale of iPhone, Mac, iPad, Services and other products. The Company recognizes revenue at the amount to which it expects to be entitled when control of the products or services is transferred to its customers. Control is generally transferred when the Company has a present right to payment and title and the significant risks and rewards of ownership of products or services are transferred to its customers. For most of the Company’s Products net sales, control transfers when products are shipped. For the Company’s Services net sales, control transfers over time as services are delivered. Payment for Products and Services net sales is collected within a short period following transfer of control or commencement of delivery of services, as applicable.The Company records reductions to Products net sales related to future product returns, price protection and other customer incentive programs based on the Company’s expectations and historical experience.For arrangements with multiple performance obligations, which represent promises within an arrangement that are distinct, the Company allocates revenue to all distinct performance obligations based on their relative stand-alone selling prices (“SSPs”). When available, the Company uses observable prices to determine SSPs. When observable prices are not available, SSPs are established that reflect the Company’s best estimates of what the selling prices of the performance obligations would be if they were sold regularly on a stand-alone basis. The Company’s process for estimating SSPs without observable prices considers multiple factors that may vary depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each performance obligation including, where applicable, prices charged by the Company for similar offerings, market trends in the pricing for similar offerings, product-specific business objectives and the estimated cost to provide the performance obligation.The Company has identified up to three performance obligations regularly included in arrangements involving the sale of iPhone, Mac, iPad and certain other products. The first performance obligation, which represents the substantial portion of the allocated sales price, is the hardware and bundled software delivered at the time of sale. The second performance obligation is the right to receive certain product-related bundled services, which include iCloud®, Siri® and Maps. The third performance obligation is the right to receive, on a when-and-if-available basis, future unspecified software upgrades relating to the software bundled with each device. The Company allocates revenue and any related discounts to these performance obligations based on their relative SSPs. Because the Company lacks observable prices for the undelivered performance obligations, the allocation of revenue is based on the Company’s estimated SSPs. Revenue allocated to the delivered hardware and bundled software is recognized when control has transferred to the customer, which generally occurs when the product is shipped. Revenue allocated to the product-related bundled services and unspecified software upgrade rights is deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis over the estimated period they are expected to be provided. Cost of sales related to delivered hardware and bundled software, including estimated warranty costs, are recognized at the time of sale. Costs incurred to provide product-related bundled services and unspecified software upgrade rights are recognized as cost of sales as incurred.For certain long-term service arrangements, the Company has performance obligations for services it has not yet delivered. For these arrangements, the Company does not have a right to bill for the undelivered services. The Company has determined that any unbilled consideration relates entirely to the value of the undelivered services. Accordingly, the Company has not recognized revenue, and does not disclose amounts, related to these undelivered services.Apple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 34

For the sale of third-party products where the Company obtains control of the product before transferring it to the customer, the Company recognizes revenue based on the gross amount billed to customers. The Company considers multiple factors when determining whether it obtains control of third-party products, including evaluating if it can establish the price of the product, retains inventory risk for tangible products or has the responsibility for ensuring acceptability of the product. For third-party applications sold through the App Store and certain digital content sold through the Company’s other digital content stores, the Company does not obtain control of the product before transferring it to the customer. Therefore, the Company accounts for such sales on a net basis by recognizing in Services net sales only the commission it retains.The Company records revenue net of taxes collected from customers that are remitted to governmental authorities, with the collected taxes recorded within other current liabilities until remitted to the relevant government authority.Share-Based CompensationThe Company generally measures share-based compensation based on the closing price of the Company’s common stock on the date of grant, and recognizes expense on a straight-line basis for its estimate of equity awards that will ultimately vest. Further information regarding share-based compensation can be found in Note 9, “Benefit Plans.”Earnings Per ShareThe following table shows the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share for 2022, 2021 and 2020 (net income in millions and shares in thousands):The Company applies the treasury stock method to determine the dilutive effect of potentially dilutive securities.Cash Equivalents and Marketable SecuritiesAll highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase are classified as cash equivalents.The Company’s investments in marketable debt securities have been classified and accounted for as available-for-sale. The Company classifies its marketable debt securities as either short-term or long-term based on each instrument’s underlying contractual maturity date.The Company’s investments in marketable equity securities are classified based on the nature of the securities and their availability for use in current operations.The cost of securities sold is determined using the specific identification method.InventoriesInventories are measured using the first-in, first-out method.Apple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 35



Restricted Marketable SecuritiesThe Company considers marketable securities to be restricted when withdrawal or general use is legally restricted. The Company reports restricted marketable securities as current or non-current marketable securities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets based on the classification of the underlying securities.Property, Plant and EquipmentDepreciation on property, plant and equipment is recognized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which for buildings is the shorter of 40 years or the remaining life of the building; between one and five years for machinery and equipment, including manufacturing equipment; and the shorter of the lease term or useful life for leasehold improvements. Capitalized costs related to internal-use software are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which range from five to seven years. Depreciation and amortization expense on property, plant and equipment was $8.7 billion, $9.5 billion and $9.7 billion during 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.Derivative Instruments and HedgingAll derivative instruments are recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value. The accounting treatment for derivative gains and losses is based on intended use and hedge designation.Gains and losses arising from amounts that are included in the assessment of cash flow hedge effectiveness are initially deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss) (“AOCI”) and subsequently reclassified into earnings when the hedged transaction affects earnings, and in the same line item in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. For options designated as cash flow hedges, the Company excludes time value from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and recognizes it on a straight-line basis over the life of the hedge in the Consolidated Statements of Operations line item to which the hedge relates. Changes in the fair value of amounts excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness are recognized in other comprehensive income/(loss) (“OCI”).Gains and losses arising from amounts that are included in the assessment of fair value hedge effectiveness are recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Operations line item to which the hedge relates along with offsetting losses and gains related to the change in value of the hedged item. For foreign exchange forward contracts designated as fair value hedges, the Company excludes the forward carry component from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and recognizes it in other income/(expense), net (“OI&E”) on a straight-line basis over the life of the hedge. Changes in the fair value of amounts excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness are recognized in OCI.Gains and losses arising from changes in the fair values of derivative instruments that are not designated as accounting hedges are recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Operations line items to which the derivative instruments relate.The Company presents derivative assets and liabilities at their gross fair values in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company classifies cash flows related to derivative instruments as operating activities in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.Fair Value MeasurementsThe fair values of the Company’s money market funds and certain marketable equity securities are based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets. The valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of the Company’s debt instruments and all other financial instruments, which generally have counterparties with high credit ratings, are based on quoted market prices or model-driven valuations using significant inputs derived from or corroborated by observable market data.Income TaxesThe Company records certain deferred tax assets and liabilities in connection with the minimum tax on certain foreign earnings created by the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the “Act”).LeasesThe Company combines and accounts for lease and nonlease components as a single lease component for leases of corporate, data center and retail facilities. The discount rates related to the Company’s lease liabilities are generally based on estimates of the Company’s incremental borrowing rate, as the discount rates implicit in the Company’s leases cannot be readily determined.Apple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 36

Segment ReportingThe Company reports segment information based on the “management” approach. The management approach designates the internal reporting used by management for making decisions and assessing performance as the source of the Company’s reportable segments.The Company manages its business primarily on a geographic basis. The Company’s reportable segments consist of the Americas, Europe, Greater China, Japan and Rest of Asia Pacific. Americas includes both North and South America. Europe includes European countries, as well as India, the Middle East and Africa. Greater China includes China mainland, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Rest of Asia Pacific includes Australia and those Asian countries not included in the Company’s other reportable segments. Although the reportable segments provide similar hardware and software products and similar services, each one is managed separately to better align with the location of the Company’s customers and distribution partners and the unique market dynamics of each geographic region. The accounting policies of the various segments are the same as those described elsewhere in this Note 1, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.”The Company evaluates the performance of its reportable segments based on net sales and operating income. Net sales for geographic segments are generally based on the location of customers and sales through the Company’s retail stores located in those geographic locations. Operating income for each segment includes net sales to third parties, related cost of sales and operating expenses directly attributable to the segment. Advertising expenses are generally included in the geographic segment in which the expenditures are incurred. Operating income for each segment excludes other income and expense and certain expenses managed outside the reportable segments. Costs excluded from segment operating income include various corporate expenses such as research and development (“R&D”), corporate marketing expenses, certain share-based compensation expenses, income taxes, various nonrecurring charges and other separately managed general and administrative costs. The Company does not include intercompany transfers between segments for management reporting purposes.Note 2 – RevenueNet sales disaggregated by significant products and services for 2022, 2021 and 2020 were as follows (in millions):(1)Products net sales include amortization of the deferred value of unspecified software upgrade rights, which are bundled in the sales price of the respective product.(2)Wearables, Home and Accessories net sales include sales of AirPods, Apple TV, Apple Watch, Beats products, HomePod mini and accessories.(3)Services net sales include sales from the Company’s advertising, AppleCare, cloud, digital content, payment and other services. Services net sales also include amortization of the deferred value of services bundled in the sales price of certain products.(4)Includes $7.5 billion of revenue recognized in 2022 that was included in deferred revenue as of September 25, 2021, $6.7 billion of revenue recognized in 2021 that was included in deferred revenue as of September 26, 2020, and $5.0 billion of revenue recognized in 2020 that was included in deferred revenue as of September 28, 2019.The Company’s proportion of net sales by disaggregated revenue source was generally consistent for each reportable segment in Note 11, “Segment Information and Geographic Data” for 2022, 2021 and 2020, except in Greater China, where iPhone revenue represented a moderately higher proportion of net sales in 2022 and 2021.As of September 24, 2022 and September 25, 2021, the Company had total deferred revenue of $12.4 billion and $11.9 billion, respectively. As of September 24, 2022, the Company expects 64% of total deferred revenue to be realized in less than a year, 27% within one-to-two years, 7% within two-to-three years and 2% in greater than three years.Apple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 37

The following table shows the fair value of the Company’s non-current marketable debt securities, by contractual maturity, as of September 24, 2022 (in millions):Derivative Instruments and HedgingThe Company may use derivative instruments to partially offset its business exposure to foreign exchange and interest rate risk. However, the Company may choose not to hedge certain exposures for a variety of reasons including accounting considerations or the prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures. There can be no assurance the hedges will offset more than a portion of the financial impact resulting from movements in foreign exchange or interest rates.Foreign Exchange RiskTo protect gross margins from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, the Company may enter into forward contracts, option contracts or other instruments, and may designate these instruments as cash flow hedges. The Company generally hedges portions of its forecasted foreign currency exposure associated with revenue and inventory purchases, typically for up to 12 months.To protect the Company’s foreign currency–denominated term debt or marketable securities from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, the Company may enter into forward contracts, cross-currency swaps or other instruments. The Company designates these instruments as either cash flow or fair value hedges. As of September 24, 2022, the maximum length of time over which the Company is hedging its exposure to the variability in future cash flows for term debt–related foreign currency transactions is 20 years.The Company may also enter into derivative instruments that are not designated as accounting hedges to protect gross margins from certain fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, as well as to offset a portion of the foreign currency exchange gains and losses generated by the remeasurement of certain assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies.Interest Rate RiskTo protect the Company’s term debt or marketable securities from fluctuations in interest rates, the Company may enter into interest rate swaps, options or other instruments. The Company designates these instruments as either cash flow or fair value hedges.The notional amounts of the Company’s outstanding derivative instruments as of September 24, 2022 and September 25, 2021 were as follows (in millions):Apple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 39

The gross fair values of the Company’s derivative assets and liabilities as of September 24, 2022 were as follows (in millions):(1)Derivative assets are measured using Level 2 fair value inputs and are included in other current assets and other non-current assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.(2)Derivative liabilities are measured using Level 2 fair value inputs and are included in other current liabilities and other non-current liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.The derivative assets above represent the Company’s gross credit exposure if all counterparties failed to perform. To mitigate credit risk, the Company generally enters into collateral security arrangements that provide for collateral to be received or posted when the net fair values of certain derivatives fluctuate from contractually established thresholds. To further limit credit risk, the Company generally enters into master netting arrangements with the respective counterparties to the Company’s derivative contracts, under which the Company is allowed to settle transactions with a single net amount payable by one party to the other. As of September 24, 2022, the potential effects of these rights of set-off associated with the Company’s derivative contracts, including the effects of collateral, would be a reduction to both derivative assets and derivative liabilities of $7.8 billion, resulting in a net derivative asset of $412 million.The carrying amounts of the Company’s hedged items in fair value hedges as of September 24, 2022 and September 25, 2021 were as follows (in millions):Accounts ReceivableTrade ReceivablesThe Company has considerable trade receivables outstanding with its third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers, resellers, small and mid-sized businesses and education, enterprise and government customers. The Company generally does not require collateral from its customers; however, the Company will require collateral or third-party credit support in certain instances to limit credit risk. In addition, when possible, the Company attempts to limit credit risk on trade receivables with credit insurance for certain customers or by requiring third-party financing, loans or leases to support credit exposure. These credit-financing arrangements are directly between the third-party financing company and the end customer. As such, the Company generally does not assume any recourse or credit risk sharing related to any of these arrangements.As of September 24, 2022, the Company had one customer that represented 10% or more of total trade receivables, which accounted for 10%. The Company’s cellular network carriers accounted for 44% and 42% of total trade receivables as of September 24, 2022 and September 25, 2021, respectively.Vendor Non-Trade ReceivablesThe Company has non-trade receivables from certain of its manufacturing vendors resulting from the sale of components to these vendors who manufacture subassemblies or assemble final products for the Company. The Company purchases these components directly from suppliers. As of September 24, 2022, the Company had two vendors that individually represented 10% or more of total vendor non-trade receivables, which accounted for 54% and 13%. As of September 25, 2021, the Company had three vendors that individually represented 10% or more of total vendor non-trade receivables, which accounted for 52%, 11% and 11%.Apple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 40

Uncertain Tax PositionsAs of September 24, 2022, the total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits was $16.8 billion, of which $8.0 billion, if recognized, would impact the Company’s effective tax rate. As of September 25, 2021, the total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits was $15.5 billion, of which $6.6 billion, if recognized, would have impacted the Company’s effective tax rate.The aggregate change in the balance of gross unrecognized tax benefits, which excludes interest and penalties, for 2022, 2021 and 2020, is as follows (in millions):The Company is subject to taxation and files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and many state and foreign jurisdictions. Tax years after 2017 for the U.S. federal jurisdiction, and after 2014 in certain major foreign jurisdictions, remain subject to examination. Although the timing of resolution and/or closure of examinations is not certain, the Company believes it is reasonably possible that its gross unrecognized tax benefits could decrease in the next 12 months by as much as $4.8 billion.European Commission State Aid DecisionOn August 30, 2016, the European Commission announced its decision that Ireland granted state aid to the Company by providing tax opinions in 1991 and 2007 concerning the tax allocation of profits of the Irish branches of two subsidiaries of the Company (the “State Aid Decision”). The State Aid Decision ordered Ireland to calculate and recover additional taxes from the Company for the period June 2003 through December 2014. Irish legislative changes, effective as of January 2015, eliminated the application of the tax opinions from that date forward. The recovery amount was calculated to be €13.1 billion, plus interest of €1.2 billion. The Company and Ireland appealed the State Aid Decision to the General Court of the Court of Justice of the European Union (the “General Court”). On July 15, 2020, the General Court annulled the State Aid Decision. On September 25, 2020, the European Commission appealed the General Court’s decision to the European Court of Justice. The Company believes that any incremental Irish corporate income taxes potentially due related to the State Aid Decision would be creditable against U.S. taxes, subject to any foreign tax credit limitations in the Act.On an annual basis, the Company may request approval from the Irish Minister for Finance to reduce the recovery amount for certain taxes paid to other countries. As of September 24, 2022, the adjusted recovery amount was €12.7 billion, excluding interest. The adjusted recovery amount plus interest is funded into escrow, where it will remain restricted from general use pending the conclusion of all legal proceedings. Refer to the Cash, Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities section of Note 3, “Financial Instruments” for more information.Note 6 – LeasesThe Company has lease arrangements for certain equipment and facilities, including corporate, data center, manufacturing and retail space. These leases typically have original terms not exceeding 10 years and generally contain multiyear renewal options, some of which are reasonably certain of exercise.Payments under the Company’s lease arrangements may be fixed or variable, and variable lease payments are primarily based on purchases of output of the underlying leased assets. Lease costs associated with fixed payments on the Company’s operating leases were $1.9 billion, $1.7 billion and $1.5 billion for 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Lease costs associated with variable payments on the Company’s leases were $14.9 billion, $12.9 billion and $9.3 billion for 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.The Company made $1.8 billion, $1.4 billion and $1.5 billion of fixed cash payments related to operating leases in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Noncash activities involving right-of-use (“ROU”) assets obtained in exchange for lease liabilities were $2.8 billion for 2022, $3.3 billion for 2021 and $10.5 billion for 2020, including the impact of adopting the Financial Accounting Standards Board’s Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) in the first quarter of 2020.Apple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 43

RSUs granted under the 2022 Plan generally vest over four years, based on continued employment, and are settled upon vesting in shares of the Company’s common stock on a one-for-one basis. RSUs granted under the 2022 Plan reduce the number of shares available for grant under the plan by a factor of two times the number of RSUs granted. RSUs canceled and shares withheld to satisfy tax withholding obligations increase the number of shares available for grant under the 2022 Plan utilizing a factor of two times the number of RSUs canceled or shares withheld. All RSUs granted under the 2022 Plan have dividend equivalent rights (“DERs”), which entitle holders of RSUs to the same dividend value per share as holders of common stock. DERs are subject to the same vesting and other terms and conditions as the underlying RSUs. A maximum of approximately 1.3 billion shares were authorized for issuance pursuant to 2022 Plan awards at the time the plan was approved on March 4, 2022.2014 Employee Stock PlanThe Apple Inc. 2014 Employee Stock Plan (the “2014 Plan”) is a shareholder-approved plan that provided for broad-based equity grants to employees, including executive officers. The 2014 Plan permitted the granting of substantially the same types of equity awards with substantially the same terms as the 2022 Plan. The 2014 Plan also permitted the granting of cash bonus awards. In the third quarter of 2022, the Company terminated the authority to grant new awards under the 2014 Plan.Apple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 46

Apple Inc. Non-Employee Director Stock PlanThe Apple Inc. Non-Employee Director Stock Plan (the “Director Plan”) is a shareholder-approved plan that (i) permits the Company to grant awards of RSUs or stock options to the Company’s non-employee directors, (ii) provides for automatic initial grants of RSUs upon a non-employee director joining the Board of Directors and automatic annual grants of RSUs at each annual meeting of shareholders, and (iii) permits the Board of Directors to prospectively change the value and relative mixture of stock options and RSUs for the initial and annual award grants and the methodology for determining the number of shares of the Company’s common stock subject to these grants, in each case within the limits set forth in the Director Plan and without further shareholder approval. RSUs granted under the Director Plan reduce the number of shares available for grant under the plan by a factor of two times the number of RSUs granted. The Director Plan expires on November 12, 2027. All RSUs granted under the Director Plan are entitled to DERs, which are subject to the same vesting and other terms and conditions as the underlying RSUs. A maximum of approximately 45 million shares (split-adjusted) were authorized for issuance pursuant to Director Plan awards at the time the plan was last amended on November 9, 2021.Employee Stock Purchase PlanThe Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the “Purchase Plan”) is a shareholder-approved plan under which substantially all employees may voluntarily enroll to purchase the Company’s common stock through payroll deductions at a price equal to 85% of the lower of the fair market values of the stock as of the beginning or the end of six-month offering periods. An employee’s payroll deductions under the Purchase Plan are limited to 10% of the employee’s eligible compensation and employees may not purchase more than $25,000 of stock during any calendar year. A maximum of approximately 230 million shares (split-adjusted) were authorized for issuance under the Purchase Plan at the time the plan was last amended and restated on March 10, 2015.401(k) PlanThe Company’s 401(k) Plan is a tax-qualified deferred compensation arrangement under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code. Under the 401(k) Plan, participating U.S. employees may contribute a portion of their eligible earnings, subject to applicable U.S. Internal Revenue Service and plan limits. The Company matches 50% to 100% of each employee’s contributions, depending on length of service, up to a maximum of 6% of the employee’s eligible earnings.Restricted Stock UnitsA summary of the Company’s RSU activity and related information for 2022, 2021 and 2020, is as follows:The fair value as of the respective vesting dates of RSUs was $18.2 billion, $19.0 billion and $10.8 billion for 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The majority of RSUs that vested in 2022, 2021 and 2020 were net share settled such that the Company withheld shares with a value equivalent to the employees’ obligation for the applicable income and other employment taxes, and remitted the cash to the appropriate taxing authorities. The total shares withheld were approximately 41 million, 53 million and 56 million for 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively, and were based on the value of the RSUs on their respective vesting dates as determined by the Company’s closing stock price. Total payments to taxing authorities for employees’ tax obligations were $6.4 billion, $6.8 billion and $3.9 billion in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.Apple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 47

Share-Based CompensationThe following table shows share-based compensation expense and the related income tax benefit included in the Consolidated Statements of Operations for 2022, 2021 and 2020 (in millions):As of September 24, 2022, the total unrecognized compensation cost related to outstanding RSUs and stock options was $16.7 billion, which the Company expects to recognize over a weighted-average period of 2.6 years.Note 10 – Commitments and ContingenciesConcentrations in the Available Sources of Supply of Materials and ProductAlthough most components essential to the Company’s business are generally available from multiple sources, certain components are currently obtained from single or limited sources. The Company also competes for various components with other participants in the markets for smartphones, personal computers, tablets, wearables and accessories. Therefore, many components used by the Company, including those that are available from multiple sources, are at times subject to industry-wide shortage and significant commodity pricing fluctuations.The Company uses some custom components that are not commonly used by its competitors, and new products introduced by the Company often utilize custom components available from only one source. When a component or product uses new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers’ yields have matured or their manufacturing capacities have increased. The continued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at all, may be affected if suppliers decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the Company’s requirements.Substantially all of the Company’s hardware products are manufactured by outsourcing partners that are located primarily in Asia, with some Mac computers manufactured in the U.S. and Ireland.Unconditional Purchase ObligationsThe Company has entered into certain off–balance sheet commitments that require the future purchase of goods or services (“unconditional purchase obligations”). The Company’s unconditional purchase obligations primarily consist of payments for supplier arrangements, internet services and content creation. Future payments under noncancelable unconditional purchase obligations with a remaining term in excess of one year as of September 24, 2022, are as follows (in millions):ContingenciesThe Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that have arisen in the ordinary course of business and that have not been fully resolved. The outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain. In the opinion of management, there was not at least a reasonable possibility the Company may have incurred a material loss, or a material loss greater than a recorded accrual, concerning loss contingencies for asserted legal and other claims.Apple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 48

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting FirmTo the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of Apple Inc.Opinion on Internal Control Over Financial ReportingWe have audited Apple Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of September 24, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the “COSO criteria”). In our opinion, Apple Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of September 24, 2022, based on the COSO criteria.We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (the “PCAOB”), the consolidated balance sheets of Apple Inc. as of September 24, 2022 and September 25, 2021, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, shareholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 24, 2022, and the related notes and our report dated October 27, 2022 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.Basis for OpinionApple Inc.’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on Apple Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to Apple Inc. in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial ReportingA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate./s/ Ernst & Young LLPSan Jose, CaliforniaOctober 27, 2022Apple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 52



Item 9.    Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial DisclosureNone.Item 9A.    Controls and ProceduresEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and ProceduresBased on an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of the Company’s management, the Company’s principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act were effective as of September 24, 2022 to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC rules and forms and (ii) accumulated and communicated to the Company’s management, including its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.Inherent Limitations over Internal ControlsThe Company’s internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). The Company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: (i)pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the Company’s assets;(ii)provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and that the Company’s receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of the Company’s management and directors; and(iii)provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the Company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.Management, including the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that the Company’s internal controls will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of internal controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. Also, any evaluation of the effectiveness of controls in future periods are subject to the risk that those internal controls may become inadequate because of changes in business conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial ReportingThe Company’s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act). Management conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria set forth in Internal Control – Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework). Based on the Company’s assessment, management has concluded that its internal control over financial reporting was effective as of September 24, 2022 to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP. The Company’s independent registered public accounting firm, Ernst & Young LLP, has issued an audit report on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting, which appears in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K.Changes in Internal Control over Financial ReportingThere were no changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting during the fourth quarter of 2022, which were identified in connection with management’s evaluation required by paragraph (d) of Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.Apple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 53


# 2023 AAPL

## Item 1A


The Company has a large, global business with sales outside the U.S. representing a majority of the Company’s total net sales, and the Company believes that it generally benefits from growth in international trade. Substantially all of the Company’s manufacturing is performed in whole or in part by outsourcing partners located primarily in China mainland, India, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Vietnam. Restrictions on international trade, such as tariffs and other controls on imports or exports of goods, technology or data, can materially adversely affect the Company’s operations and supply chain and limit the Company’s ability to offer and distribute its products and services to customers. The impact can be particularly significant if these restrictive measures apply to countries and regions where the Company derives a significant portion of its revenues and/or has significant supply chain operations. Restrictive measures can require the Company to take various actions, including changing suppliers, restructuring business relationships, and ceasing to offer third-party applications on its platforms. Changing the Company’s operations in accordance with new or changed restrictions on international trade can be expensive, time-consuming and disruptive to the Company’s operations. Such restrictions can be announced with little or no advance notice and the Company may not be able to effectively mitigate all adverse impacts from such measures. For example, tensions between governments, including the U.S. and China, have in the past led to tariffs and other restrictions being imposed on the Company’s business. If disputes and conflicts further escalate in the future, actions by governments in response could be significantly more severe and restrictive and could materially adversely affect the Company’s business. Political uncertainty surrounding trade and other international disputes could also have a negative effect on consumer confidence and spending, which could adversely affect the Company’s business.Many of the Company’s operations and facilities, as well as critical business operations of the Company’s suppliers and contract manufacturers, are in locations that are prone to earthquakes and other natural disasters. In addition, such operations and facilities are subject to the risk of interruption by fire, power shortages, nuclear power plant accidents and other industrial accidents, terrorist attacks and other hostile acts, ransomware and other cybersecurity attacks, labor disputes, public health issues, including pandemics such as the COVID-19 pandemic, and other events beyond the Company’s control. Global climate change is resulting in certain types of natural disasters, such as droughts, floods, hurricanes and wildfires, occurring more frequently or with more intense effects. Such events can make it difficult or impossible for the Company to manufacture and deliver products to its customers, create delays and inefficiencies in the Company’s supply and manufacturing chain, and result in slowdowns and outages to the Company’s service offerings, and negatively impact consumer spending and demand in affected areas. Following an interruption to its business, the Company can require substantial recovery time, experience significant expenditures to resume operations, and lose significant sales. Because the Company relies on single or limited sources for the supply and manufacture of many critical components, a business interruption affecting such sources would exacerbate any negative consequences to the Company.The Company’s operations are also subject to the risks of industrial accidents at its suppliers and contract manufacturers. While the Company’s suppliers are required to maintain safe working environments and operations, an industrial accident could occur and could result in serious injuries or loss of life, disruption to the Company’s business, and harm to the Company’s reputation. Major public health issues, including pandemics such as the COVID-19 pandemic, have adversely affected, and could in the future materially adversely affect, the Company due to their impact on the global economy and demand for consumer products; the imposition of protective public safety measures, such as stringent employee travel restrictions and limitations on freight services and the movement of products between regions; and disruptions in the Company’s operations, supply chain and sales and distribution channels, resulting in interruptions to the supply of current products and offering of existing services, and delays in production ramps of new products and development of new services.While the Company maintains insurance coverage for certain types of losses, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses that may arise.Global markets for the Company’s products and services are highly competitive and subject to rapid technological change, and the Company may be unable to compete effectively in these markets.The Company’s products and services are offered in highly competitive global markets characterized by aggressive price competition and resulting downward pressure on gross margins, frequent introduction of new products and services, short product life cycles, evolving industry standards, continual improvement in product price and performance characteristics, rapid adoption of technological advancements by competitors, and price sensitivity on the part of consumers and businesses.The Company’s ability to compete successfully depends heavily on ensuring the continuing and timely introduction of innovative new products, services and technologies to the marketplace. The Company designs and develops nearly the entire solution for its products, including the hardware, operating system, numerous software applications and related services. As a result, the Company must make significant investments in R&D. There can be no assurance these investments will achieve expected returns, and the Company may not be able to develop and market new products and services successfully.Apple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 6



The Company currently holds a significant number of patents, trademarks and copyrights and has registered, and applied to register, additional patents, trademarks and copyrights. In contrast, many of the Company’s competitors seek to compete primarily through aggressive pricing and very low cost structures, and by imitating the Company’s products and infringing on its intellectual property. Effective intellectual property protection is not consistently available in every country in which the Company operates. If the Company is unable to continue to develop and sell innovative new products with attractive margins or if competitors infringe on the Company’s intellectual property, the Company’s ability to maintain a competitive advantage could be materially adversely affected.The Company has a minority market share in the global smartphone, personal computer and tablet markets. The Company faces substantial competition in these markets from companies that have significant technical, marketing, distribution and other resources, as well as established hardware, software and digital content supplier relationships. In addition, some of the Company’s competitors have broader product lines, lower-priced products and a larger installed base of active devices. Competition has been particularly intense as competitors have aggressively cut prices and lowered product margins. Certain competitors have the resources, experience or cost structures to provide products at little or no profit or even at a loss. Some of the markets in which the Company competes have from time to time experienced little to no growth or contracted overall.Additionally, the Company faces significant competition as competitors imitate the Company’s product features and applications within their products or collaborate to offer solutions that are more competitive than those they currently offer. The Company also expects competition to intensify as competitors imitate the Company’s approach to providing components seamlessly within their offerings or work collaboratively to offer integrated solutions.The Company’s services also face substantial competition, including from companies that have significant resources and experience and have established service offerings with large customer bases. The Company competes with business models that provide content to users for free. The Company also competes with illegitimate means to obtain third-party digital content and applications.The Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition depend substantially on the Company’s ability to continually improve its products and services to maintain their functional and design advantages. There can be no assurance the Company will be able to continue to provide products and services that compete effectively.Business RisksTo remain competitive and stimulate customer demand, the Company must successfully manage frequent introductions and transitions of products and services.Due to the highly volatile and competitive nature of the markets and industries in which the Company competes, the Company must continually introduce new products, services and technologies, enhance existing products and services, effectively stimulate customer demand for new and upgraded products and services, and successfully manage the transition to these new and upgraded products and services. The success of new product and service introductions depends on a number of factors, including timely and successful development, market acceptance, the Company’s ability to manage the risks associated with new technologies and production ramp-up issues, the availability of application software for the Company’s products, the effective management of purchase commitments and inventory levels in line with anticipated product demand, the availability of products in appropriate quantities and at expected costs to meet anticipated demand, and the risk that new products and services may have quality or other defects or deficiencies. There can be no assurance the Company will successfully manage future introductions and transitions of products and services.The Company depends on component and product manufacturing and logistical services provided by outsourcing partners, many of which are located outside of the U.S.Substantially all of the Company’s manufacturing is performed in whole or in part by outsourcing partners located primarily in China mainland, India, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Vietnam, and a significant concentration of this manufacturing is currently performed by a small number of outsourcing partners, often in single locations. Changes or additions to the Company’s supply chain require considerable time and resources and involve significant risks and uncertainties. The Company has also outsourced much of its transportation and logistics management. While these arrangements can lower operating costs, they also reduce the Company’s direct control over production and distribution. Such diminished control has from time to time and may in the future have an adverse effect on the quality or quantity of products manufactured or services provided, or adversely affect the Company’s flexibility to respond to changing conditions. Although arrangements with these partners may contain provisions for product defect expense reimbursement, the Company generally remains responsible to the consumer for warranty and out-of-warranty service in the event of product defects and experiences unanticipated product defect liabilities from time to time. While the Company relies on its partners to adhere to its supplier code of conduct, violations of the supplier code of conduct occur from time to time and can materially adversely affect the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.Apple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 7



The Company relies on single-source outsourcing partners in the U.S., Asia and Europe to supply and manufacture many components, and on outsourcing partners primarily located in Asia, for final assembly of substantially all of the Company’s hardware products. Any failure of these partners to perform can have a negative impact on the Company’s cost or supply of components or finished goods. In addition, manufacturing or logistics in these locations or transit to final destinations can be disrupted for a variety of reasons, including natural and man-made disasters, information technology system failures, commercial disputes, armed conflict, economic, business, labor, environmental, public health or political issues, or international trade disputes.The Company has invested in manufacturing process equipment, much of which is held at certain of its outsourcing partners, and has made prepayments to certain of its suppliers associated with long-term supply agreements. While these arrangements help ensure the supply of components and finished goods, if these outsourcing partners or suppliers experience severe financial problems or other disruptions in their business, such continued supply can be reduced or terminated, and the recoverability of manufacturing process equipment or prepayments can be negatively impacted.Future operating results depend upon the Company’s ability to obtain components in sufficient quantities on commercially reasonable terms.Because the Company currently obtains certain components from single or limited sources, the Company is subject to significant supply and pricing risks. Many components, including those that are available from multiple sources, are at times subject to industry-wide shortages and significant commodity pricing fluctuations that can materially adversely affect the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition. For example, the global semiconductor industry has in the past experienced high demand and shortages of supply, which adversely affected the Company’s ability to obtain sufficient quantities of components and products on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Such disruptions could occur in the future. While the Company has entered into agreements for the supply of many components, there can be no assurance the Company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms, or at all. Component suppliers may suffer from poor financial conditions, which can lead to business failure for the supplier or consolidation within a particular industry, further limiting the Company’s ability to obtain sufficient quantities of components on commercially reasonable terms or at all. The effects of global or regional economic conditions on the Company’s suppliers, described in “The Company’s operations and performance depend significantly on global and regional economic conditions and adverse economic conditions can materially adversely affect the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition,” above, can also affect the Company’s ability to obtain components. Therefore, the Company remains subject to significant risks of supply shortages and price increases that can materially adversely affect its business, results of operations and financial condition.The Company’s new products often utilize custom components available from only one source. When a component or product uses new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers’ yields have matured or their manufacturing capacities have increased. The continued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at all, can be affected for any number of reasons, including if suppliers decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the Company’s requirements. When the Company’s supply of components for a new or existing product has been delayed or constrained, or when an outsourcing partner has delayed shipments of completed products to the Company, the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition have been adversely affected and future delays or constraints could materially adversely affect the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition. The Company’s business and financial performance could also be materially adversely affected depending on the time required to obtain sufficient quantities from the source, or to identify and obtain sufficient quantities from an alternative source.The Company’s products and services may be affected from time to time by design and manufacturing defects that could materially adversely affect the Company’s business and result in harm to the Company’s reputation.The Company offers complex hardware and software products and services that can be affected by design and manufacturing defects. Sophisticated operating system software and applications, such as those offered by the Company, often have issues that can unexpectedly interfere with the intended operation of hardware or software products and services. Defects can also exist in components and products the Company purchases from third parties. Component defects could make the Company’s products unsafe and create a risk of environmental or property damage and personal injury. These risks may increase as the Company’s products are introduced into specialized applications, including health. In addition, the Company’s service offerings can have quality issues and from time to time experience outages, service slowdowns or errors. As a result, from time to time the Company’s services have not performed as anticipated and may not meet customer expectations. There can be no assurance the Company will be able to detect and fix all issues and defects in the hardware, software and services it offers. Failure to do so can result in widespread technical and performance issues affecting the Company’s products and services. In addition, the Company can be exposed to product liability claims, recalls, product replacements or modifications, write-offs of inventory, property, plant and equipment or intangible assets, and significant warranty and other expenses, including litigation costs and regulatory fines. Quality problems can also adversely affect the experience for users of the Company’s products and services, and result in harm to the Company’s reputation, loss of competitive advantage, poor market acceptance, reduced demand for products and services, delay in new product and service introductions and lost sales.Apple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 8



The Company is exposed to the risk of write-downs on the value of its inventory and other assets, in addition to purchase commitment cancellation risk.The Company records a write-down for product and component inventories that have become obsolete or exceed anticipated demand, or for which cost exceeds net realizable value. The Company also accrues necessary cancellation fee reserves for orders of excess products and components. The Company reviews long-lived assets, including capital assets held at its suppliers’ facilities and inventory prepayments, for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate the assets may not be recoverable. If the Company determines that an impairment has occurred, it records a write-down equal to the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value. Although the Company believes its inventory, capital assets, inventory prepayments and other assets and purchase commitments are currently recoverable, there can be no assurance the Company will not incur write-downs, fees, impairments and other charges given the rapid and unpredictable pace of product obsolescence in the industries in which the Company competes.The Company orders components for its products and builds inventory in advance of product announcements and shipments. Manufacturing purchase obligations cover the Company’s forecasted component and manufacturing requirements, typically for periods up to 150 days. Because the Company’s markets are volatile, competitive and subject to rapid technology and price changes, there is a risk the Company will forecast incorrectly and order or produce excess or insufficient amounts of components or products, or not fully utilize firm purchase commitments.The Company relies on access to third-party intellectual property, which may not be available to the Company on commercially reasonable terms or at all.The Company’s products and services are designed to include intellectual property owned by third parties, which requires licenses from those third parties. In addition, because of technological changes in the industries in which the Company currently competes or in the future may compete, current extensive patent coverage and the rapid rate of issuance of new patents, the Company’s products and services can unknowingly infringe existing patents or intellectual property rights of others. From time to time, the Company has been notified that it may be infringing certain patents or other intellectual property rights of third parties. Based on experience and industry practice, the Company believes licenses to such third-party intellectual property can generally be obtained on commercially reasonable terms. However, there can be no assurance the necessary licenses can be obtained on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Failure to obtain the right to use third-party intellectual property, or to use such intellectual property on commercially reasonable terms, can preclude the Company from selling certain products or services, or otherwise have a material adverse impact on the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition.The Company’s future performance depends in part on support from third-party software developers.The Company believes decisions by customers to purchase its hardware products depend in part on the availability of third-party software applications and services. There can be no assurance third-party developers will continue to develop and maintain software applications and services for the Company’s products. If third-party software applications and services cease to be developed and maintained for the Company’s products, customers may choose not to buy the Company’s products.The Company believes the availability of third-party software applications and services for its products depends in part on the developers’ perception and analysis of the relative benefits of developing, maintaining and upgrading such software and services for the Company’s products compared to competitors’ platforms, such as Android for smartphones and tablets, Windows for personal computers and tablets, and PlayStation, Nintendo and Xbox for gaming platforms. This analysis may be based on factors such as the market position of the Company and its products, the anticipated revenue that may be generated, expected future growth of product sales, and the costs of developing such applications and services.The Company’s minority market share in the global smartphone, personal computer and tablet markets can make developers less inclined to develop or upgrade software for the Company’s products and more inclined to devote their resources to developing and upgrading software for competitors’ products with larger market share. When developers focus their efforts on these competing platforms, the availability and quality of applications for the Company’s devices can suffer.The Company relies on the continued availability and development of compelling and innovative software applications for its products. The Company’s products and operating systems are subject to rapid technological change, and when third-party developers are unable to or choose not to keep up with this pace of change, their applications can fail to take advantage of these changes to deliver improved customer experiences, can operate incorrectly, and can result in dissatisfied customers and lower customer demand for the Company’s products.Apple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 9



The Company distributes third-party applications for its products through the App Store. For the vast majority of applications, developers keep all of the revenue they generate on the App Store. The Company retains a commission from sales of applications and sales of digital services or goods initiated within an application. From time to time, the Company has made changes to its App Store, including actions taken in response to competition, market conditions and legal and regulatory requirements. The Company expects to make further business changes in the future, including as a result of legislative initiatives impacting the App Store, such as the European Union (“EU”) Digital Markets Act, which the Company is required to comply with by March 2024. The Company is also subject to litigation and investigations relating to the App Store, which have resulted in changes to the Company’s business practices, and may in the future result in further changes. Changes have included how developers communicate with consumers outside the App Store regarding alternative purchasing mechanisms. Future changes could also affect what the Company charges developers for access to its platforms, how it manages distribution of apps outside of the App Store, and how and to what extent it allows developers to communicate with consumers inside the App Store regarding alternative purchasing mechanisms. This could reduce the volume of sales, and the commission that the Company earns on those sales, would decrease. If the rate of the commission that the Company retains on such sales is reduced, or if it is otherwise narrowed in scope or eliminated, the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.Failure to obtain or create digital content that appeals to the Company’s customers, or to make such content available on commercially reasonable terms, could have a material adverse impact on the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition.The Company contracts with numerous third parties to offer their digital content to customers. This includes the right to sell, or offer subscriptions to, third-party content, as well as the right to incorporate specific content into the Company’s own services. The licensing or other distribution arrangements for this content can be for relatively short time periods and do not guarantee the continuation or renewal of these arrangements on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Some third-party content providers and distributors currently or in the future may offer competing products and services, and can take actions to make it difficult or impossible for the Company to license or otherwise distribute their content. Other content owners, providers or distributors may seek to limit the Company’s access to, or increase the cost of, such content. The Company may be unable to continue to offer a wide variety of content at commercially reasonable prices with acceptable usage rules.The Company also produces its own digital content, which can be costly to produce due to intense and increasing competition for talent, content and subscribers, and may fail to appeal to the Company’s customers.Some third-party digital content providers require the Company to provide digital rights management and other security solutions. If requirements change, the Company may have to develop or license new technology to provide these solutions. There can be no assurance the Company will be able to develop or license such solutions at a reasonable cost and in a timely manner.The Company’s success depends largely on the talents and efforts of its team members, the continued service and availability of highly skilled employees, including key personnel, and the Company’s ability to nurture its distinctive and inclusive culture.Much of the Company’s future success depends on the talents and efforts of its team members and the continued availability and service of key personnel, including its Chief Executive Officer, executive team and other highly skilled employees. Experienced personnel in the technology industry are in high demand and competition for their talents is intense, especially in Silicon Valley, where most of the Company’s key personnel are located. In addition to intense competition for talent, workforce dynamics are constantly evolving. If the Company does not manage changing workforce dynamics effectively, it could materially adversely affect the Company’s culture, reputation and operational flexibility.The Company believes that its distinctive and inclusive culture is a significant driver of its success. If the Company is unable to nurture its culture, it could materially adversely affect the Company’s ability to recruit and retain the highly skilled employees who are critical to its success, and could otherwise materially adversely affect the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.The Company depends on the performance of carriers, wholesalers, retailers and other resellers.The Company distributes its products and certain of its services through cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers and resellers, many of which distribute products and services from competitors. The Company also sells its products and services and resells third-party products in most of its major markets directly to consumers, small and mid-sized businesses, and education, enterprise and government customers through its retail and online stores and its direct sales force.Some carriers providing cellular network service for the Company’s products offer financing, installment payment plans or subsidies for users’ purchases of the device. There can be no assurance such offers will be continued at all or in the same amounts.Apple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 10



The Company has invested and will continue to invest in programs to enhance reseller sales, including staffing selected resellers’ stores with Company employees and contractors, and improving product placement displays. These programs can require a substantial investment while not assuring return or incremental sales. The financial condition of these resellers could weaken, these resellers could stop distributing the Company’s products, or uncertainty regarding demand for some or all of the Company’s products could cause resellers to reduce their ordering and marketing of the Company’s products.The Company’s business and reputation are impacted by information technology system failures and network disruptions.The Company and its global supply chain are dependent on complex information technology systems and are exposed to information technology system failures or network disruptions caused by natural disasters, accidents, power disruptions, telecommunications failures, acts of terrorism or war, computer viruses, physical or electronic break-ins, ransomware or other cybersecurity incidents, or other events or disruptions. System upgrades, redundancy and other continuity measures may be ineffective or inadequate, and the Company’s or its vendors’ business continuity and disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities. Such failures or disruptions can adversely impact the Company’s business by, among other things, preventing access to the Company’s online services, interfering with customer transactions or impeding the manufacturing and shipping of the Company’s products. These events could materially adversely affect the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.Losses or unauthorized access to or releases of confidential information, including personal information, could subject the Company to significant reputational, financial, legal and operational consequences.The Company’s business requires it to use and store confidential information, including personal information, with respect to the Company’s customers and employees. The Company devotes significant resources to network and data security, including through the use of encryption and other security measures intended to protect its systems and data. But these measures cannot provide absolute security, and losses or unauthorized access to or releases of confidential information occur and could materially adversely affect the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.The Company’s business also requires it to share confidential information with suppliers and other third parties. The Company relies on global suppliers that are also exposed to ransomware and other malicious attacks that can disrupt business operations. Although the Company takes steps to secure confidential information that is provided to or accessible by third parties working on the Company’s behalf, such measures are not always effective and losses or unauthorized access to, or releases of, confidential information occur. Such incidents and other malicious attacks could materially adversely affect the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.The Company experiences malicious attacks and other attempts to gain unauthorized access to its systems on a regular basis. These attacks seek to compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of confidential information or disrupt normal business operations, and can, among other things, impair the Company’s ability to attract and retain customers for its products and services, impact the Company’s stock price, materially damage commercial relationships, and expose the Company to litigation or government investigations, which could result in penalties, fines or judgments against the Company. Globally, attacks are expected to continue accelerating in both frequency and sophistication with increasing use by actors of tools and techniques that are designed to circumvent controls, avoid detection, and remove or obfuscate forensic evidence, all of which hinders the Company’s ability to identify, investigate and recover from incidents. In addition, attacks against the Company and its customers can escalate during periods of severe diplomatic or armed conflict.Although malicious attacks perpetrated to gain access to confidential information, including personal information, affect many companies across various industries, the Company is at a relatively greater risk of being targeted because of its high profile and the value of the confidential information it creates, owns, manages, stores and processes.The Company has implemented systems and processes intended to secure its information technology systems and prevent unauthorized access to or loss of sensitive data, and mitigate the impact of unauthorized access, including through the use of encryption and authentication technologies. As with all companies, these security measures may not be sufficient for all eventualities and may be vulnerable to hacking, ransomware attacks, employee error, malfeasance, system error, faulty password management or other irregularities. For example, third parties can fraudulently induce the Company’s or its vendors’ employees or customers into disclosing usernames, passwords or other sensitive information, which can, in turn, be used for unauthorized access to the Company’s or its vendors’ systems and services. To help protect customers and the Company, the Company deploys and makes available technologies like multifactor authentication, monitors its services and systems for unusual activity and may freeze accounts under suspicious circumstances, which, among other things, can result in the delay or loss of customer orders or impede customer access to the Company’s products and services.While the Company maintains insurance coverage that is intended to address certain aspects of data security risks, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise.Apple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 11



Investment in new business strategies and acquisitions could disrupt the Company’s ongoing business, present risks not originally contemplated and materially adversely affect the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.The Company has invested, and in the future may invest, in new business strategies or acquisitions. Such endeavors may involve significant risks and uncertainties, including distraction of management from current operations, greater-than-expected liabilities and expenses, economic, political, legal and regulatory challenges associated with operating in new businesses, regions or countries, inadequate return on capital, potential impairment of tangible and intangible assets, and significant write-offs. Investment and acquisition transactions are exposed to additional risks, including failing to obtain required regulatory approvals on a timely basis or at all, or the imposition of onerous conditions that could delay or prevent the Company from completing a transaction or otherwise limit the Company’s ability to fully realize the anticipated benefits of a transaction. These new ventures are inherently risky and may not be successful. The failure of any significant investment could materially adversely affect the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.The Company’s retail stores are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties.The Company’s retail operations are subject to many factors that pose risks and uncertainties and could adversely impact the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition, including macroeconomic factors that could have an adverse effect on general retail activity. Other factors include the Company’s ability to: manage costs associated with retail store construction and operation; manage relationships with existing retail partners; manage costs associated with fluctuations in the value of retail inventory; and obtain and renew leases in quality retail locations at a reasonable cost.Legal and Regulatory Compliance RisksThe Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely impacted by unfavorable results of legal proceedings or government investigations.The Company is subject to various claims, legal proceedings and government investigations that have arisen in the ordinary course of business and have not yet been fully resolved, and new matters may arise in the future. In addition, agreements entered into by the Company sometimes include indemnification provisions which can subject the Company to costs and damages in the event of a claim against an indemnified third party. The number of claims, legal proceedings and government investigations involving the Company, and the alleged magnitude of such claims, proceedings and government investigations, has generally increased over time and may continue to increase.The Company has faced and continues to face a significant number of patent claims relating to its cellular-enabled products, and new claims may arise in the future, including as a result of new legal or regulatory frameworks. For example, technology and other patent-holding companies frequently assert their patents and seek royalties and often enter into litigation based on allegations of patent infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. The Company is vigorously defending infringement actions in courts in several U.S. jurisdictions, as well as internationally in various countries. The plaintiffs in these actions frequently seek injunctions and substantial damages.Regardless of the merit of particular claims, defending against litigation or responding to government investigations can be expensive, time-consuming and disruptive to the Company’s operations. In recognition of these considerations, the Company may enter into agreements or other arrangements to settle litigation and resolve such challenges. There can be no assurance such agreements can be obtained on acceptable terms or that litigation will not occur. These agreements can also significantly increase the Company’s cost of sales and operating expenses and require the Company to change its business practices and limit the Company’s ability to offer certain products and services.Except as described in Part I, Item 3 of this Form 10-K under the heading “Legal Proceedings” and in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Note 12, “Commitments, Contingencies and Supply Concentrations” under the heading “Contingencies,” in the opinion of management, there was not at least a reasonable possibility the Company may have incurred a material loss, or a material loss greater than a recorded accrual, concerning loss contingencies for asserted legal and other claims.The outcome of litigation or government investigations is inherently uncertain. If one or more legal matters were resolved against the Company or an indemnified third party in a reporting period for amounts above management’s expectations, the Company’s results of operations and financial condition for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected. Further, such an outcome can result in significant compensatory, punitive or trebled monetary damages, disgorgement of revenue or profits, remedial corporate measures or injunctive relief against the Company, and has from time to time required, and can in the future require, the Company to change its business practices and limit the Company’s ability to offer certain products and services, all of which could materially adversely affect the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.While the Company maintains insurance coverage for certain types of claims, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise.Apple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 12



The Company is subject to complex and changing laws and regulations worldwide, which exposes the Company to potential liabilities, increased costs and other adverse effects on the Company’s business.The Company’s global operations are subject to complex and changing laws and regulations on subjects, including antitrust; privacy, data security and data localization; consumer protection; advertising, sales, billing and e-commerce; financial services and technology; product liability; intellectual property ownership and infringement; digital platforms; machine learning and artificial intelligence; internet, telecommunications and mobile communications; media, television, film and digital content; availability of third-party software applications and services; labor and employment; anticorruption; import, export and trade; foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions; anti–money laundering; foreign ownership and investment; tax; and environmental, health and safety, including electronic waste, recycling, product design and climate change.Compliance with these laws and regulations is onerous and expensive. New and changing laws and regulations can adversely affect the Company’s business by increasing the Company’s costs, limiting the Company’s ability to offer a product, service or feature to customers, imposing changes to the design of the Company’s products and services, impacting customer demand for the Company’s products and services, and requiring changes to the Company’s supply chain and its business. New and changing laws and regulations can also create uncertainty about how such laws and regulations will be interpreted and applied. These risks and costs may increase as the Company’s products and services are introduced into specialized applications, including health and financial services. The Company has implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations, but there can be no assurance the Company’s employees, contractors or agents will not violate such laws and regulations or the Company’s policies and procedures. If the Company is found to have violated laws and regulations, it could materially adversely affect the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition. Regulatory changes and other actions that materially adversely affect the Company’s business may be announced with little or no advance notice and the Company may not be able to effectively mitigate all adverse impacts from such measures. For example, the Company is subject to changing regulations relating to the export and import of its products. Although the Company has programs, policies and procedures in place that are designed to satisfy regulatory requirements, there can be no assurance that such policies and procedures will be effective in preventing a violation or a claim of a violation. As a result, the Company’s products could be banned, delayed or prohibited from importation, which could materially adversely affect the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.Expectations relating to environmental, social and governance considerations and related reporting obligations expose the Company to potential liabilities, increased costs, reputational harm, and other adverse effects on the Company’s business.Many governments, regulators, investors, employees, customers and other stakeholders are increasingly focused on environmental, social and governance considerations relating to businesses, including climate change and greenhouse gas emissions, human and civil rights, and diversity, equity and inclusion. In addition, the Company makes statements about its goals and initiatives through its various non-financial reports, information provided on its website, press statements and other communications. Responding to these environmental, social and governance considerations and implementation of these goals and initiatives involves risks and uncertainties, requires investments, and depends in part on third-party performance or data that is outside the Company’s control. The Company cannot guarantee that it will achieve its announced environmental, social and governance goals and initiatives. In addition, some stakeholders may disagree with the Company’s goals and initiatives. Any failure, or perceived failure, by the Company to achieve its goals, further its initiatives, adhere to its public statements, comply with federal, state or international environmental, social and governance laws and regulations, or meet evolving and varied stakeholder expectations and standards could result in legal and regulatory proceedings against the Company and materially adversely affect the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and stock price.The technology industry, including, in some instances, the Company, is subject to intense media, political and regulatory scrutiny, which exposes the Company to increasing regulation, government investigations, legal actions and penalties.From time to time, the Company has made changes to its App Store, including actions taken in response to litigation, competition, market conditions and legal and regulatory requirements. The Company expects to make further business changes in the future, including as a result of legislative initiatives impacting the App Store, such as the EU Digital Markets Act, which the Company is required to comply with by March 2024, or similar laws in other jurisdictions. Changes have included how developers communicate with consumers outside the App Store regarding alternative purchasing mechanisms. Future changes could also affect what the Company charges developers for access to its platforms, how it manages distribution of apps outside of the App Store, and how and to what extent it allows developers to communicate with consumers inside the App Store regarding alternative purchasing mechanisms.Apple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 13



The Company is also currently subject to antitrust investigations in various jurisdictions around the world, which can result in legal proceedings and claims against the Company that could, individually or in the aggregate, have a materially adverse impact on the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition. For example, the Company is the subject of investigations in Europe and other jurisdictions relating to App Store terms and conditions. If such investigations result in adverse findings against the Company, the Company could be exposed to significant fines and may be required to make changes to its App Store business, all of which could materially adversely affect the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition. The Company is also subject to litigation relating to the App Store, which has resulted in changes to the Company’s business practices, and may in the future result in further changes.Further, the Company has commercial relationships with other companies in the technology industry that are or may become subject to investigations and litigation that, if resolved against those other companies, could materially adversely affect the Company’s commercial relationships with those business partners and materially adversely affect the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition. For example, the Company earns revenue from licensing arrangements with other companies to offer their search services on the Company’s platforms and applications, and certain of these arrangements are currently subject to government investigations and legal proceedings.There can be no assurance the Company’s business will not be materially adversely affected, individually or in the aggregate, by the outcomes of such investigations, litigation or changes to laws and regulations in the future. Changes to the Company’s business practices to comply with new laws and regulations or in connection with other legal proceedings could negatively impact the reputation of the Company’s products for privacy and security and otherwise adversely affect the experience for users of the Company’s products and services, and result in harm to the Company’s reputation, loss of competitive advantage, poor market acceptance, reduced demand for products and services, and lost sales.The Company’s business is subject to a variety of U.S. and international laws, rules, policies and other obligations regarding data protection.The Company is subject to an increasing number of federal, state and international laws relating to the collection, use, retention, security and transfer of various types of personal information. In many cases, these laws apply not only to third-party transactions, but also restrict transfers of personal information among the Company and its international subsidiaries. Several jurisdictions have passed laws in this area, and additional jurisdictions are considering imposing additional restrictions or have laws that are pending. These laws continue to develop and may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Complying with emerging and changing requirements causes the Company to incur substantial costs and has required and may in the future require the Company to change its business practices. Noncompliance could result in significant penalties or legal liability.The Company makes statements about its use and disclosure of personal information through its privacy policy, information provided on its website, press statements and other privacy notices provided to customers. Any failure by the Company to comply with these public statements or with other federal, state or international privacy or data protection laws and regulations could result in inquiries or proceedings against the Company by governmental entities or others. In addition to reputational impacts, penalties could include ongoing audit requirements and significant legal liability.In addition to the risks generally relating to the collection, use, retention, security and transfer of personal information, the Company is also subject to specific obligations relating to information considered sensitive under applicable laws, such as health data, financial data and biometric data. Health data and financial data are subject to additional privacy, security and breach notification requirements, and the Company is subject to audit by governmental authorities regarding the Company’s compliance with these obligations. If the Company fails to adequately comply with these rules and requirements, or if health data or financial data is handled in a manner not permitted by law or under the Company’s agreements with healthcare or financial institutions, the Company can be subject to litigation or government investigations, and can be liable for associated investigatory expenses, and can also incur significant fees or fines.Payment card data is also subject to additional requirements. Under payment card rules and obligations, if cardholder information is potentially compromised, the Company can be liable for associated investigatory expenses and can also incur significant fees or fines if the Company fails to follow payment card industry data security standards. The Company could also experience a significant increase in payment card transaction costs or lose the ability to process payment cards if it fails to follow payment card industry data security standards, which could materially adversely affect the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.Apple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 14



Financial RisksThe Company expects its quarterly net sales and results of operations to fluctuate.The Company’s profit margins vary across its products, services, geographic segments and distribution channels. For example, the gross margins on the Company’s products and services vary significantly and can change over time. The Company’s gross margins are subject to volatility and downward pressure due to a variety of factors, including: continued industry-wide global product pricing pressures and product pricing actions that the Company may take in response to such pressures; increased competition; the Company’s ability to effectively stimulate demand for certain of its products and services; compressed product life cycles; supply shortages; potential increases in the cost of components, outside manufacturing services, and developing, acquiring and delivering content for the Company’s services; the Company’s ability to manage product quality and warranty costs effectively; shifts in the mix of products and services, or in the geographic, currency or channel mix, including to the extent that regulatory changes require the Company to modify its product and service offerings; fluctuations in foreign exchange rates; inflation and other macroeconomic pressures; and the introduction of new products or services, including new products or services with higher cost structures. These and other factors could have a materially adverse impact on the Company’s results of operations and financial condition.The Company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its fiscal year due in part to seasonal holiday demand. Additionally, new product and service introductions can significantly impact net sales, cost of sales and operating expenses. Further, the Company generates a significant portion of its net sales from a single product and a decline in demand for that product could significantly impact quarterly net sales. The Company could also be subject to unexpected developments, such as lower-than-anticipated demand for the Company’s products or services, issues with new product or service introductions, information technology system failures or network disruptions, or failure of one of the Company’s logistics, components supply, or manufacturing partners.The Company’s financial performance is subject to risks associated with changes in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to local currencies.The Company’s primary exposure to movements in foreign exchange rates relates to non–U.S. dollar–denominated sales, cost of sales and operating expenses worldwide. Gross margins on the Company’s products in foreign countries and on products that include components obtained from foreign suppliers have in the past been adversely affected and could in the future be materially adversely affected by foreign exchange rate fluctuations.The weakening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar adversely affects the U.S. dollar value of the Company’s foreign currency–denominated sales and earnings, and generally leads the Company to raise international pricing, potentially reducing demand for the Company’s products. In some circumstances, for competitive or other reasons, the Company may decide not to raise international pricing to offset the U.S. dollar’s strengthening, which would adversely affect the U.S. dollar value of the gross margins the Company earns on foreign currency–denominated sales.Conversely, a strengthening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, while generally beneficial to the Company’s foreign currency–denominated sales and earnings, could cause the Company to reduce international pricing or incur losses on its foreign currency derivative instruments, thereby limiting the benefit. Additionally, strengthening of foreign currencies may increase the Company’s cost of product components denominated in those currencies, thus adversely affecting gross margins.The Company uses derivative instruments, such as foreign currency forward and option contracts, to hedge certain exposures to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. The use of such hedging activities may not be effective to offset any, or more than a portion, of the adverse financial effects of unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates over the limited time the hedges are in place.The Company is exposed to credit risk and fluctuations in the values of its investment portfolio.The Company’s investments can be negatively affected by changes in liquidity, credit deterioration, financial results, market and economic conditions, political risk, sovereign risk, interest rate fluctuations or other factors. As a result, the value and liquidity of the Company’s cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities may fluctuate substantially. Therefore, although the Company has not realized any significant losses on its cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, future fluctuations in their value could result in significant losses and could have a material adverse impact on the Company’s results of operations and financial condition.Apple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 15



The Company is exposed to credit risk on its trade accounts receivable, vendor non-trade receivables and prepayments related to long-term supply agreements, and this risk is heightened during periods when economic conditions worsen.The Company distributes its products and certain of its services through third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers and resellers. The Company also sells its products and services directly to small and mid-sized businesses and education, enterprise and government customers. A substantial majority of the Company’s outstanding trade receivables are not covered by collateral, third-party bank support or financing arrangements, or credit insurance, and a significant portion of the Company’s trade receivables can be concentrated within cellular network carriers or other resellers. The Company’s exposure to credit and collectibility risk on its trade receivables is higher in certain international markets and its ability to mitigate such risks may be limited. The Company also has unsecured vendor non-trade receivables resulting from purchases of components by outsourcing partners and other vendors that manufacture subassemblies or assemble final products for the Company. In addition, the Company has made prepayments associated with long-term supply agreements to secure supply of inventory components. As of September 30, 2023, the Company’s vendor non-trade receivables and prepayments related to long-term supply agreements were concentrated among a few individual vendors located primarily in Asia. While the Company has procedures to monitor and limit exposure to credit risk on its trade and vendor non-trade receivables, as well as long-term prepayments, there can be no assurance such procedures will effectively limit its credit risk and avoid losses.The Company is subject to changes in tax rates, the adoption of new U.S. or international tax legislation and exposure to additional tax liabilities.The Company is subject to taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions, including Ireland and Singapore, where a number of the Company’s subsidiaries are organized. Due to economic and political conditions, tax laws and tax rates for income taxes and other non-income taxes in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change. For example, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development continues to advance proposals for modernizing international tax rules, including the introduction of global minimum tax standards. The Company’s effective tax rates are affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, the introduction of new taxes, and changes in tax laws or their interpretation. The application of tax laws may be uncertain, require significant judgment and be subject to differing interpretations.The Company is also subject to the examination of its tax returns and other tax matters by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities and governmental bodies. The Company regularly assesses the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of its provision for taxes. There can be no assurance as to the outcome of these examinations. If the Company’s effective tax rates were to increase, or if the ultimate determination of the Company’s taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued, the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.General RisksThe price of the Company’s stock is subject to volatility.The Company’s stock has experienced substantial price volatility in the past and may continue to do so in the future. Additionally, the Company, the technology industry and the stock market as a whole have, from time to time, experienced extreme stock price and volume fluctuations that have affected stock prices in ways that may have been unrelated to these companies’ operating performance. Price volatility may cause the average price at which the Company repurchases its stock in a given period to exceed the stock’s price at a given point in time. The Company believes the price of its stock should reflect expectations of future growth and profitability. The Company also believes the price of its stock should reflect expectations that its cash dividend will continue at current levels or grow, and that its current share repurchase program will be fully consummated. Future dividends are subject to declaration by the Company’s Board of Directors, and the Company’s share repurchase program does not obligate it to acquire any specific number of shares. If the Company fails to meet expectations related to future growth, profitability, dividends, share repurchases or other market expectations, the price of the Company’s stock may decline significantly, which could have a material adverse impact on investor confidence and employee retention.Item 1B.    Unresolved Staff CommentsNone.Item 1C.    CybersecurityNot applicable.Apple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 16

Gross MarginProducts and Services gross margin and gross margin percentage for 2023, 2022 and 2021 were as follows (dollars in millions):Products Gross MarginProducts gross margin decreased during 2023 compared to 2022 due to the weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar and lower Products volume, partially offset by cost savings and a different Products mix.Products gross margin percentage increased during 2023 compared to 2022 due to cost savings and a different Products mix, partially offset by the weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar and decreased leverage.Services Gross MarginServices gross margin increased during 2023 compared to 2022 due primarily to higher Services net sales, partially offset by the weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar and higher Services costs.Services gross margin percentage decreased during 2023 compared to 2022 due to higher Services costs and the weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, partially offset by a different Services mix.The Company’s future gross margins can be impacted by a variety of factors, as discussed in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K under the heading “Risk Factors.” As a result, the Company believes, in general, gross margins will be subject to volatility and downward pressure.Operating ExpensesOperating expenses for 2023, 2022 and 2021 were as follows (dollars in millions):Research and DevelopmentThe year-over-year growth in R&D expense in 2023 was driven primarily by increases in headcount-related expenses.Selling, General and AdministrativeSelling, general and administrative expense was relatively flat in 2023 compared to 2022.Apple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 23

Provision for Income TaxesProvision for income taxes, effective tax rate and statutory federal income tax rate for 2023, 2022 and 2021 were as follows (dollars in millions):The Company’s effective tax rate for 2023 and 2022 was lower than the statutory federal income tax rate due primarily to a lower effective tax rate on foreign earnings, the impact of the U.S. federal R&D credit, and tax benefits from share-based compensation, partially offset by state income taxes.The Company’s effective tax rate for 2023 was lower compared to 2022 due primarily to a lower effective tax rate on foreign earnings and the impact of U.S. foreign tax credit regulations issued by the U.S. Department of the Treasury in 2022, partially offset by lower tax benefits from share-based compensation.Liquidity and Capital ResourcesThe Company believes its balances of cash, cash equivalents and unrestricted marketable securities, which totaled $148.3 billion as of September 30, 2023, along with cash generated by ongoing operations and continued access to debt markets, will be sufficient to satisfy its cash requirements and capital return program over the next 12 months and beyond.The Company’s material cash requirements include the following contractual obligations:DebtAs of September 30, 2023, the Company had outstanding fixed-rate notes with varying maturities for an aggregate principal amount of $106.6 billion (collectively the “Notes”), with $9.9 billion payable within 12 months. Future interest payments associated with the Notes total $41.1 billion, with $2.9 billion payable within 12 months.The Company also issues unsecured short-term promissory notes pursuant to a commercial paper program. As of September 30, 2023, the Company had $6.0 billion of commercial paper outstanding, all of which was payable within 12 months.LeasesThe Company has lease arrangements for certain equipment and facilities, including corporate, data center, manufacturing and retail space. As of September 30, 2023, the Company had fixed lease payment obligations of $15.8 billion, with $2.0 billion payable within 12 months.Manufacturing Purchase ObligationsThe Company utilizes several outsourcing partners to manufacture subassemblies for the Company’s products and to perform final assembly and testing of finished products. The Company also obtains individual components for its products from a wide variety of individual suppliers. As of September 30, 2023, the Company had manufacturing purchase obligations of $53.1 billion, with $52.9 billion payable within 12 months. The Company’s manufacturing purchase obligations are primarily noncancelable.Other Purchase ObligationsThe Company’s other purchase obligations primarily consist of noncancelable obligations to acquire capital assets, including assets related to product manufacturing, and noncancelable obligations related to supplier arrangements, licensed intellectual property and content, and distribution rights. As of September 30, 2023, the Company had other purchase obligations of $21.9 billion, with $5.6 billion payable within 12 months.Deemed Repatriation Tax PayableAs of September 30, 2023, the balance of the deemed repatriation tax payable imposed by the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the “Act”) was $22.0 billion, with $6.5 billion expected to be paid within 12 months.Apple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 24



Capital Return ProgramIn addition to its contractual cash requirements, the Company has an authorized share repurchase program. The program does not obligate the Company to acquire a minimum amount of shares. As of September 30, 2023, the Company’s quarterly cash dividend was $0.24 per share. The Company intends to increase its dividend on an annual basis, subject to declaration by the Board of Directors.Critical Accounting EstimatesThe preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) and the Company’s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and operating results require the Company’s management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported. Note 1, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Company’s consolidated financial statements. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities.Uncertain Tax PositionsThe Company is subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. The evaluation of the Company’s uncertain tax positions involves significant judgment in the interpretation and application of GAAP and complex domestic and international tax laws, including the Act and matters related to the allocation of international taxation rights between countries. Although management believes the Company’s reserves are reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final outcome of these uncertainties will not be different from that which is reflected in the Company’s reserves. Reserves are adjusted considering changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax examination. Resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with management’s expectations could have a material impact on the Company’s financial condition and operating results.Legal and Other ContingenciesThe Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business, the outcomes of which are inherently uncertain. The Company records a liability when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable, the determination of which requires significant judgment. Resolution of legal matters in a manner inconsistent with management’s expectations could have a material impact on the Company’s financial condition and operating results.Apple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 25

Note 2 – RevenueThe Company recognizes revenue at the amount to which it expects to be entitled when control of the products or services is transferred to its customers. Control is generally transferred when the Company has a present right to payment and title and the significant risks and rewards of ownership of products or services are transferred to its customers. For most of the Company’s Products net sales, control transfers when products are shipped. For the Company’s Services net sales, control transfers over time as services are delivered. Payment for Products and Services net sales is collected within a short period following transfer of control or commencement of delivery of services, as applicable.The Company records reductions to Products net sales related to future product returns, price protection and other customer incentive programs based on the Company’s expectations and historical experience.For arrangements with multiple performance obligations, which represent promises within an arrangement that are distinct, the Company allocates revenue to all distinct performance obligations based on their relative stand-alone selling prices (“SSPs”). When available, the Company uses observable prices to determine SSPs. When observable prices are not available, SSPs are established that reflect the Company’s best estimates of what the selling prices of the performance obligations would be if they were sold regularly on a stand-alone basis. The Company’s process for estimating SSPs without observable prices considers multiple factors that may vary depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each performance obligation including, where applicable, prices charged by the Company for similar offerings, market trends in the pricing for similar offerings, product-specific business objectives and the estimated cost to provide the performance obligation.The Company has identified up to three performance obligations regularly included in arrangements involving the sale of iPhone, Mac, iPad and certain other products. The first performance obligation, which represents the substantial portion of the allocated sales price, is the hardware and bundled software delivered at the time of sale. The second performance obligation is the right to receive certain product-related bundled services, which include iCloud®, Siri® and Maps. The third performance obligation is the right to receive, on a when-and-if-available basis, future unspecified software upgrades relating to the software bundled with each device. The Company allocates revenue and any related discounts to these performance obligations based on their relative SSPs. Because the Company lacks observable prices for the undelivered performance obligations, the allocation of revenue is based on the Company’s estimated SSPs. Revenue allocated to the delivered hardware and bundled software is recognized when control has transferred to the customer, which generally occurs when the product is shipped. Revenue allocated to the product-related bundled services and unspecified software upgrade rights is deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis over the estimated period they are expected to be provided.For certain long-term service arrangements, the Company has performance obligations for services it has not yet delivered. For these arrangements, the Company does not have a right to bill for the undelivered services. The Company has determined that any unbilled consideration relates entirely to the value of the undelivered services. Accordingly, the Company has not recognized revenue, and does not disclose amounts, related to these undelivered services.For the sale of third-party products where the Company obtains control of the product before transferring it to the customer, the Company recognizes revenue based on the gross amount billed to customers. The Company considers multiple factors when determining whether it obtains control of third-party products, including evaluating if it can establish the price of the product, retains inventory risk for tangible products or has the responsibility for ensuring acceptability of the product. For third-party applications sold through the App Store, the Company does not obtain control of the product before transferring it to the customer. Therefore, the Company accounts for all third-party application–related sales on a net basis by recognizing in Services net sales only the commission it retains.Apple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 34

The following table shows the fair value of the Company’s non-current marketable debt securities, by contractual maturity, as of September 30, 2023 (in millions):The Company’s investments in marketable debt securities have been classified and accounted for as available-for-sale. The Company classifies marketable debt securities as either current or non-current based solely on each instrument’s underlying contractual maturity date.Derivative Instruments and HedgingThe Company may use derivative instruments to partially offset its business exposure to foreign exchange and interest rate risk. However, the Company may choose not to hedge certain exposures for a variety of reasons including accounting considerations or the prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures. There can be no assurance the hedges will offset more than a portion of the financial impact resulting from movements in foreign exchange or interest rates.The Company classifies cash flows related to derivative instruments in the same section of the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows as the items being hedged, which are generally classified as operating activities.Foreign Exchange Rate RiskTo protect gross margins from fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, the Company may use forwards, options or other instruments, and may designate these instruments as cash flow hedges. The Company generally hedges portions of its forecasted foreign currency exposure associated with revenue and inventory purchases, typically for up to 12 months.To protect the Company’s foreign currency–denominated term debt or marketable securities from fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, the Company may use forwards, cross-currency swaps or other instruments. The Company designates these instruments as either cash flow or fair value hedges. As of September 30, 2023, the maximum length of time over which the Company is hedging its exposure to the variability in future cash flows for term debt–related foreign currency transactions is 19 years.The Company may also use derivative instruments that are not designated as accounting hedges to protect gross margins from certain fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, as well as to offset a portion of the foreign currency gains and losses generated by the remeasurement of certain assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies.Interest Rate RiskTo protect the Company’s term debt or marketable securities from fluctuations in interest rates, the Company may use interest rate swaps, options or other instruments. The Company designates these instruments as either cash flow or fair value hedges.The notional amounts of the Company’s outstanding derivative instruments as of September 30, 2023 and September 24, 2022 were as follows (in millions):Apple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 37

The gross fair values of the Company’s derivative assets and liabilities as of September 24, 2022 were as follows (in millions):(1)Derivative assets are measured using Level 2 fair value inputs and are included in other current assets and other non-current assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.(2)Derivative liabilities are measured using Level 2 fair value inputs and are included in other current liabilities and other non-current liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.The derivative assets above represent the Company’s gross credit exposure if all counterparties failed to perform. To mitigate credit risk, the Company generally uses collateral security arrangements that provide for collateral to be received or posted when the net fair values of certain derivatives fluctuate from contractually established thresholds. To further limit credit risk, the Company generally uses master netting arrangements with the respective counterparties to the Company’s derivative contracts, under which the Company is allowed to settle transactions with a single net amount payable by one party to the other. As of September 24, 2022, the potential effects of these rights of set-off associated with the Company’s derivative contracts, including the effects of collateral, would be a reduction to both derivative assets and derivative liabilities of $7.8 billion, resulting in a net derivative asset of $412 million.The carrying amounts of the Company’s hedged items in fair value hedges as of September 30, 2023 and September 24, 2022 were as follows (in millions):Accounts ReceivableTrade ReceivablesAs of September 24, 2022, the Company had one customer that represented 10% or more of total trade receivables, which accounted for 10%. The Company’s third-party cellular network carriers accounted for 41% and 44% of total trade receivables as of September 30, 2023 and September 24, 2022, respectively. The Company requires third-party credit support or collateral from certain customers to limit credit risk.Vendor Non-Trade ReceivablesThe Company has non-trade receivables from certain of its manufacturing vendors resulting from the sale of components to these vendors who manufacture subassemblies or assemble final products for the Company. The Company purchases these components directly from suppliers. The Company does not reflect the sale of these components in products net sales. Rather, the Company recognizes any gain on these sales as a reduction of products cost of sales when the related final products are sold by the Company. As of September 30, 2023, the Company had two vendors that individually represented 10% or more of total vendor non-trade receivables, which accounted for 48% and 23%. As of September 24, 2022, the Company had two vendors that individually represented 10% or more of total vendor non-trade receivables, which accounted for 54% and 13%.Apple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 38

Deferred Tax Assets and LiabilitiesAs of September 30, 2023 and September 24, 2022, the significant components of the Company’s deferred tax assets and liabilities were (in millions):As of September 30, 2023, the Company had $5.2 billion in foreign tax credit carryforwards in Ireland and $3.0 billion in California R&D credit carryforwards, both of which can be carried forward indefinitely. A valuation allowance has been recorded for the credit carryforwards and a portion of other temporary differences.Uncertain Tax PositionsAs of September 30, 2023, the total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits was $19.5 billion, of which $9.5 billion, if recognized, would impact the Company’s effective tax rate. As of September 24, 2022, the total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits was $16.8 billion, of which $8.0 billion, if recognized, would have impacted the Company’s effective tax rate.The aggregate change in the balance of gross unrecognized tax benefits, which excludes interest and penalties, for 2023, 2022 and 2021, is as follows (in millions):The Company is subject to taxation and files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and many state and foreign jurisdictions. Tax years after 2017 for the U.S. federal jurisdiction, and after 2014 in certain major foreign jurisdictions, remain subject to examination. Although the timing of resolution or closure of examinations is not certain, the Company believes it is reasonably possible that its gross unrecognized tax benefits could decrease in the next 12 months by as much as $4.5 billion.Apple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 41

European Commission State Aid DecisionOn August 30, 2016, the European Commission announced its decision that Ireland granted state aid to the Company by providing tax opinions in 1991 and 2007 concerning the tax allocation of profits of the Irish branches of two subsidiaries of the Company (the “State Aid Decision”). The State Aid Decision ordered Ireland to calculate and recover additional taxes from the Company for the period June 2003 through December 2014. Irish legislative changes, effective as of January 2015, eliminated the application of the tax opinions from that date forward. The recovery amount was calculated to be €13.1 billion, plus interest of €1.2 billion. The Company and Ireland appealed the State Aid Decision to the General Court of the Court of Justice of the European Union (the “General Court”). On July 15, 2020, the General Court annulled the State Aid Decision. On September 25, 2020, the European Commission appealed the General Court’s decision to the European Court of Justice (the “ECJ”) and a hearing was held on May 23, 2023. A decision from the ECJ is expected in calendar year 2024. The Company believes it would be eligible to claim a U.S. foreign tax credit for a portion of any incremental Irish corporate income taxes potentially due related to the State Aid Decision.On an annual basis, the Company may request approval from the Irish Minister for Finance to reduce the recovery amount for certain taxes paid to other countries.

Additionally, to manage foreign exchange rate risk on certain of its foreign currency–denominated notes, the Company uses cross-currency swaps to effectively convert these notes to U.S. dollar–denominated notes.The effective interest rates for the Notes include the interest on the Notes, amortization of the discount or premium and, if applicable, adjustments related to hedging. The Company recognized $3.7 billion, $2.8 billion and $2.6 billion of interest expense on its term debt for 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.The future principal payments for the Company’s Notes as of September 30, 2023, are as follows (in millions):As of September 30, 2023 and September 24, 2022, the fair value of the Company’s Notes, based on Level 2 inputs, was $90.8 billion and $98.8 billion, respectively.Note 10 – Shareholders’ EquityShare Repurchase ProgramDuring 2023, the Company repurchased 471 million shares of its common stock for $76.6 billion, excluding excise tax due under the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022.

Shares of Common StockThe following table shows the changes in shares of common stock for 2023, 2022 and 2021 (in thousands):Note 11 – Share-Based Compensation2022 Employee Stock PlanThe Apple Inc. 2022 Employee Stock Plan (the “2022 Plan”) is a shareholder-approved plan that provides for broad-based equity grants to employees, including executive officers, and permits the granting of RSUs, stock grants, performance-based awards, stock options and stock appreciation rights. RSUs granted under the 2022 Plan generally vest over four years, based on continued employment, and are settled upon vesting in shares of the Company’s common stock on a one-for-one basis. All RSUs granted under the 2022 Plan have dividend equivalent rights, which entitle holders of RSUs to the same dividend value per share as holders of common stock. A maximum of approximately 1.3 billion shares were authorized for issuance pursuant to 2022 Plan awards at the time the plan was approved on March 4, 2022.2014 Employee Stock PlanThe Apple Inc. 2014 Employee Stock Plan (the “2014 Plan”) is a shareholder-approved plan that provided for broad-based equity grants to employees, including executive officers. The 2014 Plan permitted the granting of substantially the same types of equity awards with substantially the same terms as the 2022 Plan. The 2014 Plan also permitted the granting of cash bonus awards. In the third quarter of 2022, the Company terminated the authority to grant new awards under the 2014 Plan.Restricted Stock UnitsA summary of the Company’s RSU activity and related information for 2023, 2022 and 2021, is as follows:The fair value as of the respective vesting dates of RSUs was $15.9 billion, $18.2 billion and $19.0 billion for 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The majority of RSUs that vested in 2023, 2022 and 2021 were net share settled such that the Company withheld shares with a value equivalent to the employees’ obligation for the applicable income and other employment taxes, and remitted the cash to the appropriate taxing authorities. The total shares withheld were approximately 37 million, 41 million and 53 million for 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and were based on the value of the RSUs on their respective vesting dates as determined by the Company’s closing stock price. Total payments to taxing authorities for employees’ tax obligations were $5.6 billion, $6.4 billion and $6.8 billion in 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.Apple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 45

The Company’s unconditional purchase obligations primarily consist of supplier arrangements, licensed intellectual property and content, and distribution rights. Future payments under noncancelable unconditional purchase obligations with a remaining term in excess of one year as of September 30, 2023, are as follows (in millions):ContingenciesThe Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that have arisen in the ordinary course of business and that have not been fully resolved. The outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain. In the opinion of management, there was not at least a reasonable possibility the Company may have incurred a material loss, or a material loss greater than a recorded accrual, concerning loss contingencies for asserted legal and other claims.Concentrations in the Available Sources of Supply of Materials and ProductAlthough most components essential to the Company’s business are generally available from multiple sources, certain components are currently obtained from single or limited sources. The Company also competes for various components with other participants in the markets for smartphones, personal computers, tablets, wearables and accessories. Therefore, many components used by the Company, including those that are available from multiple sources, are at times subject to industry-wide shortage and significant commodity pricing fluctuations.The Company uses some custom components that are not commonly used by its competitors, and new products introduced by the Company often utilize custom components available from only one source. When a component or product uses new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers’ yields have matured or their manufacturing capacities have increased. The continued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at all, may be affected if suppliers decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the Company’s requirements.Substantially all of the Company’s hardware products are manufactured by outsourcing partners that are located primarily in China mainland, India, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Vietnam.Apple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 46

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting FirmTo the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of Apple Inc.Opinion on Internal Control Over Financial ReportingWe have audited Apple Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the “COSO criteria”).

Our responsibility is to express an opinion on Apple Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to Apple Inc. in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial ReportingA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate./s/ Ernst & Young LLPSan Jose, CaliforniaNovember 2, 2023Apple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 51



Item 9.    Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial DisclosureNone.Item 9A.    Controls and ProceduresEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and ProceduresBased on an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of the Company’s management, the Company’s principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act were effective as of September 30, 2023 to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC rules and forms and (ii) accumulated and communicated to the Company’s management, including its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.Inherent Limitations over Internal ControlsThe Company’s internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP. The Company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: (i)pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the Company’s assets;(ii)provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and that the Company’s receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of the Company’s management and directors; and(iii)provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the Company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.Management, including the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that the Company’s internal controls will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of internal controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. Also, any evaluation of the effectiveness of controls in future periods are subject to the risk that those internal controls may become inadequate because of changes in business conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial ReportingThe Company’s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act). Management conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria set forth in Internal Control – Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework). Based on the Company’s assessment, management has concluded that its internal control over financial reporting was effective as of September 30, 2023 to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP. The Company’s independent registered public accounting firm, Ernst & Young LLP, has issued an audit report on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting, which appears in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K.Changes in Internal Control over Financial ReportingThere were no changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting during the fourth quarter of 2023, which were identified in connection with management’s evaluation required by paragraph (d) of Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.Apple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 52

recorded additional non-cash stock-based compensation expense, and related tax
effects, with regard to certain past stock option grants, and the company has restated
certain previously filed financial statements included in this form 10-k.the internal review, the independent investigation,
and related activities have required the company to incur substantial expenses
for legal, accounting, tax and other professional services, have diverted
managements attention from the companys business, and could in the future harm
its business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.while the company believes it has made appropriate
judgments in determining the correct measurement dates for its stock option
grants, the sec may disagree with the manner in which the company has accounted
for and reported, or not reported, the financial impact. accordingly, there is
a risk the company may have to further restate its prior financial statements,
amend prior filings with the sec, or take other actions not currently
contemplated.the companys past stock option granting practices and
the restatement of prior financial statements have exposed the company to
greater risks associated with litigation, regulatory proceedings and government
enforcement actions. as described in part i, item 3, legal proceedings,
several derivative complaints and a class action complaint have been filed in
state and federal courts against the companys directors and certain of its
executive officers pertaining to allegations relating to stock option grants.
the company has provided the results of its internal review and independent
investigation to the sec and the united states attorneys office for the
northern district of california, and in that regard the company has responded
to informal requests for documents and additional information. the company
intends to continue full cooperation. no assurance can be given regarding the
outcomes from litigation, regulatory proceedings or government enforcement
actions relating to the companys past stock option practices. the resolution
of these matters will be time consuming, expensive, and will distract
management from the conduct of the companys business. furthermore, if the
company is subject to adverse findings in litigation, regulatory proceedings or
government enforcement actions, the company could be required to pay damages or
penalties or have other remedies imposed, which could harm its business,
financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.in august 2006, the
company received a nasdaq staff determination letter stating that, as a result
of the delayed filing of the companys form 10-q for the quarter
ended july 1, 2006 (the third quarter form 10-q), the company
was not in compliance with the filing requirements for continued listing as set
forth in marketplace rule 4310(c)(14) and was therefore subject to
delisting from the nasdaq stock market. on october 24, 2006, the
nasdaq listing qualifications panel granted the companys request for continued
listing, subject to the company filing the third quarter form 10-q,
and any required restatements, with the sec by december 29, 2006. on december 29,
2006, the company filed the third quarter form 10-q with the sec. with
the filing of this form 10-k, the company believes that it has
remedied its non-compliance with marketplace rule 4310(c)(14), subject to
nasdaqs affirmative completion of its compliance protocols and its
notification of the company accordingly. however, if the sec disagrees with the
manner in which the company has accounted for and reported, or not reported,
the financial impact of past stock option grants, there could be further delays
in filing subsequent sec reports that might result in delisting of the companys
common stock from the nasdaq global select market.unfavorable results
of legal proceedings could adversely affect the companys results of
operations.the company is subject to
various legal proceedings and claims that are discussed in part i, item 3
of this form 10-k. the company is also subject to certain other
legal proceedings and claims that have arisen in the ordinary course of
business and which have not been fully adjudicated. results of legal
proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty. in addition, litigation may be
disruptive to the companys normal21

the company fail to prevail in certain legal matters, the companys financial
condition, liquidity, or results of operations could be adversely affected.economic conditions and political events could
adversely affect the demand for the companys products and the financial health
of its suppliers, distributors, and resellers.the companys operating
performance depends significantly on economic conditions in the u.s. and
abroad. at times in the past, demand for the companys products has been
negatively impacted by difficult global economic conditions. uncertainty about
future economic conditions makes it difficult to forecast future demand for the
companys products and related operating results. should global and/or regional
economic conditions deteriorate, demand for the companys products could be
adversely affected, as could the financial health of its suppliers,
distributors, and resellers.war, terrorism, public health issues, and other
circumstances could disrupt supply, delivery, or demand of products, which
could negatively affect the companys operations and performance.war, terrorism, public health issues, and other
business interruptions, whether in the u.s. or abroad, have caused and could
cause damage or disruption to international commerce
and global economy, and thus may have a strong negative impact on the global
economy, the company, and the companys suppliers or customers. the
companys major business operations are subject to interruption by earthquake,
other natural disasters, fire, power shortages, terrorist attacks and other
hostile acts, labor disputes, public health issues, and other events beyond its
control. the majority of the companys research and development activities, its
corporate headquarters, information technology systems, and other critical
business operations, including certain component suppliers and manufacturing
vendors, are located near major seismic faults. because the company does not
carry earthquake insurance for direct quake-related losses, the companys
operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely
affected in the event of a major earthquake or other natural or man-made
disaster.although it is impossible
to predict the occurrences or consequences of any such events, such events
could result in a decrease in demand for the companys products, make it
difficult or impossible for the company to deliver products to its customers or
to receive components from its suppliers, and create delays and inefficiencies
in the companys supply chain. in addition, should major public health issues
including pandemics arise, the company could be negatively affected by more
stringent employee travel restrictions, additional limitations in the
availability of freight services, governmental actions limiting the movement of
products between various regions, delays in production ramps of new products,
and disruptions in the operations of the companys manufacturing vendors and
component suppliers. the companys operating results and financial condition
have been, and in the future may be, adversely affected by such events.the market for personal computers and related
peripherals and services, as well as digital music devices and related
services, is highly competitive. if the company is unable to effectively
compete in these markets, its results of operations could be adversely affected.the personal computer industry is highly competitive
and is characterized by aggressive pricing practices, downward pressure on
gross margins, frequent introduction of new products, short product life
cycles, evolving industry standards, continual improvement in product
price/performance characteristics, rapid adoption of technological and product
advancements by competitors, price sensitivity on the part of consumers, and a
large number of competitors. price competition in the market for personal computers
and related peripherals has been particularly intense as competitors who sell
windows and linux based personal computers have aggressively cut prices and
lowered their product margins for personal computing products. the companys
results of operations and financial condition have been, and in the future may
continue to be, adversely affected by these and other industry-wide pricing
pressures and downward pressures on gross margins.22



seq.=1,folio='22',file='c:\jms\skumar\06-25759-2\task1586490\25759-2-de.htm',user='105032',cd='dec 29 04:51 2006'the personal computer industry has also been
characterized by rapid technological advances in software functionality,
hardware performance, and features based on existing or emerging industry
standards. further, as the personal computer industry and its customers place
more reliance on the internet, an increasing number of internet devices that
are smaller and simpler than traditional personal computers may compete for
market share with the companys existing products. several competitors of the
company have targeted certain of the companys key market segments, including
consumer, education, professional and consumer digital video editing, and
design and publishing. several of the companys competitors have introduced
digital music products and/or online stores offering digital music distribution
that mimic many of the unique design, technical features, and solutions of the
companys products. the company has a significant number of competitors, many
of whom have broader product lines and larger installed customer bases than
those of the company. additionally, there has been a trend towards
consolidation in the personal computer industry that has resulted in larger and
potentially stronger competitors in the companys markets.the company is currently the only maker of hardware
using the mac os. the mac os has a minority market share in the personal
computer market, which is dominated by makers of computers utilizing competing
operating systems, including windows and linux. the companys future operating
results and financial condition are substantially dependent on its ability to
continue to develop improvements to the macintosh platform to maintain
perceived design and functional advantages over competing platforms. additionally,
if unauthorized copies of the mac os are used on other companies hardware
products and result in decreased demand for the companys hardware products,
the companys results of operations may be adversely affected.the company is currently focused on market
opportunities related to digital music distribution and related consumer
electronic devices, including ipods. the company faces significant competition
from other companies promoting their own digital music products including mp3
players, music enabled cell phones, free peer-to-peer music and video services,
and free streaming of digital content via the internet. these competitors
include both new entrants with different market approaches, such as
subscription services models, and also larger companies that may have
significant technical, marketing, distribution, and other resources, as well as
established hardware, software, and digital content supplier relationships.
failure to effectively compete could negatively affect the companys operating
results and financial position. the company expects competition in this space
to intensify as competitors attempt to imitate the companys approach to
tightly integrating these components within their individual offerings or work
more collaboratively with each other to offer solutions that are more
integrated than those they offer currently. some of these current and potential
competitors have substantial resources and may be able to provide such products
and services at little or no profit or even at a loss to compete with the
companys offerings. there can be no assurance the company will be able to
continue to provide products and services that effectively compete in these
markets. the company may also have to respond to price competition by lowering
prices and/or increasing features which could adversely affect the companys
music product gross margins as well as overall company gross margins.the company also faces
significant competition in the u.s. education market. u.s. elementary and
secondary schools, as well as college and university customers, remain a core
market for the company. in an effort to gain market share and remain
competitive, the company will continue to pursue one-to-one (1:1) learning
solutions in education. 1:1 learning
solutions typically consist of a
portable computer for every student and teacher along with the installation of
a wireless network. these 1:1
learning solutions and other strategic sales are generally priced more
aggressively and could result in significantly less profitability or financial
losses, particularly for larger deals. although the company believes it has
taken certain steps to strengthen its position in the education market, there
can be no assurance that the company will be able to increase or maintain its
share of the education market or execute profitably on large strategic23



seq.=1,folio='23',file='c:\jms\skumar\06-25759-2\task1586490\25759-2-de.htm',user='105032',cd='dec 29 04:51 2006'arrangements. failure to
do so may have an adverse impact on the companys operating results and
financial condition.future operating results are dependent upon the
companys ability to obtain a sufficient supply of components, including
microprocessors, some of which are in short supply or available only from
limited sources.although most components
essential to the companys business are generally available from multiple
sources, certain key components including microprocessors and asics are
currently obtained by the company from single or limited sources. some key
components (including without limitation dram, nand flash-memory, and tft-lcd
flat-panel displays), while currently available to the company from multiple
sources, are at times subject to industry-wide availability and pricing pressures.
in addition, new products introduced by the company often initially utilize
custom components obtained from only one source until the company has evaluated
whether there is a need for, and subsequently qualifies, additional suppliers.
in situations where a component or product utilizes new technologies, initial
capacity constraints may exist until such time as the suppliers yields have
matured. the company and other producers in the personal computer and consumer
electronics industries also compete for various components with other
industries that have experienced increased demand for their products. the
company uses some components that are not common to the rest of the personal
computer or consumer electronics industries. continued availability of these
components may be affected if producers decided to concentrate on the
production of components other than those customized to meet the companys
requirements. if the supply of a key component were delayed or constrained on a
new or existing product, the companys results of operations and financial
condition could be adversely affected.the company must successfully manage frequent product
introductions and transitions to remain competitive and effectively stimulate
customer demand.due to the highly volatile and competitive nature of
the personal computer and consumer electronics industries, which are
characterized by dynamic customer demand patterns and rapid technological
advances, the company must continually introduce new products and technologies,
enhance existing products to remain competitive, and effectively stimulate
customer demand for new products and upgraded versions of the companys
existing products. the success of new product introductions is dependent on a
number of factors, including market acceptance; the companys ability to manage
the risks associated with product transitions, including the transition to
intel-based macintosh computers, and production ramp issues; the availability
of application software for new products; the effective management of purchase
commitments and inventory levels in line with anticipated product demand; the
availability of products in appropriate quantities and costs to meet
anticipated demand; and the risk that new products may have quality or other
defects in the early stages of introduction. accordingly, the company cannot
determine in advance the ultimate effect new products will have on its sales or
results of operations.in june 2005, the
company announced its plan to begin using intel microprocessors in its
computers. during 2006, the company introduced new intel-based models of the
macbook pro, macbook, mac pro, imac, and mac mini computers. the companys
transition to intel microprocessors for macintosh systems was completed in august 2006,
and its transition for xserve was completed in november 2006. this
transition has been and will continue to be subject to numerous risks and
uncertainties including the timely innovation and delivery of related hardware
and software products to support intel microprocessors, market acceptance of
intel-based macintosh computers, and the development and availability on
acceptable terms of components and services essential to enable the company to
timely deliver intel-based macintosh computers. in addition, the company is
dependent on third-party software developers such as microsoft and adobe to
timely develop current and future applications that run on intel-based
macintosh computers. universal versions of microsoft office and adobes
creative suite applications are not currently available. additionally,
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to maintain its24



seq.=1,folio='24',file='c:\jms\skumar\06-25759-2\task1586490\25759-2-de.htm',user='105032',cd='dec 29 04:51 2006'historical gross margin
percentages on its products, including intel-based macintosh computers, which
may adversely impact the companys results of operations.the companys products from time to time experience
quality problems that can result in decreased net sales and operating profits.the company sells highly
complex hardware and software products that can contain defects in design and
manufacture. sophisticated operating system software and applications, such as
those sold by the company, often contain bugs that can unexpectedly interfere
with the operation of the software. defects may also occur in components and
products the company purchases from third-parties. there can be no assurance
that the company will be able to detect and fix all defects in the hardware and
software it sells. failure to do so could result in lost revenue, loss of
reputation, and significant warranty and other expense to remedy.because orders for components, and in some cases
commitments to purchase components, must be placed in advance of customer
orders, the company faces substantial inventory risk.the company records a write-down for inventories of
components and products that have become obsolete or are in excess of
anticipated demand or net realizable value and accrues necessary reserves for
cancellation fees for orders of products and components that have been
cancelled. although the company believes its inventory and related provisions
are currently adequate, given the rapid and unpredictable pace of product
obsolescence in the computer and consumer electronics industries and the
transition to intel-based macintosh computers, no assurance can be given that
the company will not incur additional inventory and related charges. in
addition, such charges have had, and may have, a material effect on the companys
financial position and results of operations.the company must order
components for its products and build inventory in advance of product
shipments. because the companys markets are volatile and subject to rapid
technology and price changes, and because of the transition to intel-based
macintosh computers, there is a risk the company will forecast incorrectly and
produce or order from third parties excess or insufficient inventories of
particular products. consistent with industry practice, components are normally
acquired through a combination of purchase orders, supplier contracts, and open
orders based on projected demand information. such purchase commitments
typically cover the companys forecasted component and manufacturing
requirements for periods ranging from 30 to 150 days. the companys operating
results and financial condition have been in the past and may in the future be
materially adversely affected by the companys ability to manage its inventory
levels and respond to short-term shifts in customer demand patterns.the company is dependent on manufacturing and
logistics services provided by third parties, many of whom are located outside
of the u.s.most of the companys products are manufactured in
whole or in part by third-party manufacturers. in addition, the company has
outsourced much of its transportation and logistics management. while outsourcing
arrangements may lower the cost of operations, they also reduce the companys
direct control over production and distribution. it is uncertain what effect
such diminished control will have on the quality or quantity of the products
manufactured or services rendered, or the flexibility of the company to respond
to changing market conditions. in addition, the company is reliant on
third-party manufacturers to adhere to the companys supplier code of conduct. moreover,
although arrangements with such manufacturers may contain provisions for
warranty expense reimbursement, the company may remain at least initially
responsible to the consumer for warranty service in the event of product
defects. any unanticipated product defect or warranty liability, whether
pursuant to arrangements with contract manufacturers or otherwise, could
adversely affect the companys future operating results and financial
condition.25



seq.=1,folio='25',file='c:\jms\skumar\06-25759-2\task1586490\25759-2-de.htm',user='105032',cd='dec 29 04:51 2006'final assembly of products
sold by the company is currently performed in the companys manufacturing
facility in cork, ireland, and by external vendors in fremont, california;
fullerton, california; taiwan; the republic of korea; the peoples republic of
china; and the czech republic. currently, manufacturing of many of the
components used in the companys products is performed by third-party vendors
in taiwan, china, japan, korea, and singapore. final assembly of substantially
all of the companys portable products, including macbook pros, macbooks, and
ipods, is performed by third-party vendors in china. if for any reason
manufacturing or logistics in any of these locations is disrupted by regional
economic, business, labor, environmental, public health, or political issues,
or due to information technology system failures or military actions, the companys
results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.the companys future operating performance is
dependent on the performance of distributors and other resellers of the companys
products.the company distributes its products through
wholesalers, resellers, national and regional retailers, and cataloguers, many
of whom distribute products from competing manufacturers. in addition, the
company sells many of its products and resells certain third-party products in
most of its major markets directly to end-users, certain education customers,
and certain resellers through its online stores around the world and its retail
stores. many of the companys resellers operate on narrow product margins and
have been negatively impacted in the past by weak economic conditions.
considerable trade receivables that are not covered by collateral or credit
insurance are outstanding with the companys distribution and retail channel
partners. the companys business and financial results could be adversely
affected if the financial condition of these resellers weakens, if resellers
within consumer channels were to cease distribution of the companys products,
or if uncertainty regarding demand for the companys products caused resellers
to reduce their ordering and marketing of the companys products. the company
has invested and will continue to invest in various programs to enhance
reseller sales, including staffing selected resellers stores with company
employees and contractors. these programs could require a substantial
investment from the company, while providing no assurance of return or
incremental revenue to offset this investment.over the past several
years, an increasing proportion of the companys net sales have been made by
the company directly to end-users through its online stores around the world
and through its retail stores in the u.s., canada, japan, and the u.k. some of
the companys resellers have perceived this expansion of the companys direct
sales as conflicting with their own businesses and economic interests as
distributors and resellers of the companys products. perception of such a
conflict could discourage the companys resellers from investing additional
resources in the distribution and sale of the companys products or lead them
to limit or cease distribution of the companys products. the companys
business and financial results could be adversely affected if expansion of its
direct sales to end-users causes some or all of its resellers to cease or limit
distribution of the companys products.the company relies
on third-party digital content, which may not be available to the company on
commercially reasonable terms or at all.the company contracts with third parties to offer
their digital content to customers through the companys itunes store. the
company pays substantial fees to obtain the rights to offer to its customers
this third-party digital content. the companys licensing arrangements with
these third-party content providers are short-term in nature and do not guarantee
the future renewal of these arrangements at commercially reasonable terms, if
at all. certain parties in the music industry have consolidated and formed
alliances, which could limit the availability and increase the fees required to
offer digital content to customers through the itunes store. some third-party
content providers currently or may in the future offer music products and
services that compete with the companys music products and services, and could
take action to make it more difficult or impossible for the company to license
their digital content in the future. further, other distributors of third-party
content or third-party content owners may seek to limit26



seq.=1,folio='26',file='c:\jms\skumar\06-25759-2\task1586490\25759-2-de.htm',user='105032',cd='dec 29 04:51 2006'the companys access to or increase the total cost of
such content. if the company is unable to continue to offer a wide variety of
digital content at reasonable prices with acceptable usage rules, or continue
to expand its geographic reach outside the u.s., then sales and gross margins
of the companys itunes store, as well as related hardware and peripherals,
including ipods, may be adversely affected.third-party content
providers and artists require that the company provide certain digital rights
management (drm) solutions and other security mechanisms. if the requirements
from content providers or artists change, then the company may be required to
further develop or license technology to address such new rights and
requirements. in addition, certain countries have passed legislation or may
propose legislation that would force the company to license its drm solutions
so that content would be interoperable with competitor devices, which could
lessen the protection of content subjecting it to piracy and could affect
arrangements with the companys content suppliers. there is no assurance the
company will be able to develop or license such solutions at a reasonable cost
and in a timely manner, if at all, which could have a materially adverse effect
on the companys operating results and financial position.the companys future performance is dependent upon
support from third-party software developers. if third-party software
applications cease to be developed or available for the companys hardware
products, then customers may choose not to buy the companys products.the company believes decisions by customers to
purchase the companys personal computers, as opposed to windows-based
systems, are often based on the availability of third-party software
applications such as microsoft office. the company also believes the
availability of third-party application software for the companys
hardware products depends in part on third-party developers perception
and analysis of the relative benefits of developing, maintaining, and upgrading
such software for the companys products versus software for the larger windows
market or growing linux market. this analysis may be based on factors such as
the perceived strength of the company and its products, the anticipated
potential revenue that may be generated, continued acceptance by customers of mac
os x, and the costs of developing such software products. to the extent the
minority market share held by the company in the personal computer market has
caused software developers to question the companys prospects in the personal
computer market, developers could be less inclined to develop new application
software or upgrade existing software for the companys products and more
inclined to devote their resources to developing and upgrading software for the
larger windows market or growing linux market. the companys recent
announcement that it plans to add a feature to the next version of mac os x
that will enable intel-based macintosh systems to run windows xp may deter
developers from creating software applications for mac os x if such
applications are available for the windows platform. moreover, there can be no
assurance software developers will continue to develop software for mac os x on
a timely basis or at all.in june 2005, the company announced its plan to
begin using intel microprocessors in its computers. during 2006, the company
introduced new intel-based models of the macbook pro, macbook, mac pro, imac,
and mac mini computers. the companys transition to intel microprocessors for
macintosh systems was completed in august 2006, and its transition for
xserve was completed in november 2006. the company depends on third-party
software developers to timely develop current and future applications that run
on intel microprocessors. universal versions of microsoft office and adobes
creative suite applications are not currently available. the lack of
applications that run on intel-based macintosh systems, including microsoft
office and adobe creative suite, could have a materially adverse effect on the
companys operating results and financial position.in addition, past and
future development by the company of its own software applications and
solutions may negatively impact the decision of software developers, such as
microsoft and adobe, to develop, maintain, and upgrade similar or competitive software
for the companys products. the company currently markets and sells a variety
of software applications for use by professionals, consumers, and education
customers that could influence the decisions of third-party software developers
to develop or27



seq.=1,folio='27',file='c:\jms\skumar\06-25759-2\task1586490\25759-2-de.htm',user='105032',cd='dec 29 04:51 2006'upgrade
macintosh-compatible software products. software applications currently
marketed by the company include software for professional film and video
editing, professional compositing and visual effects for large format film and
video productions, professional music production and music post production,
professional and consumer dvd encoding and authoring, professional digital
photo editing and workflow management, consumer digital video and digital photo
editing and management, digital music management, desktop-based database
management, word processing, and high-quality presentations. discontinuance of
third-party software products for the macintosh platform could have an adverse
effect on the companys net sales and results of operations.the companys business relies on access to patents and
intellectual property obtained from third parties, and the companys future
results could be adversely affected if it is alleged or found to have infringed
on the intellectual property rights of others.many of the companys products are designed to include
intellectual property obtained from third parties. while it may be necessary in
the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of its
products and business methods, the company believes that based upon past
experience and industry practice, such licenses generally could be obtained on
commercially reasonable terms. however, there can be no assurance that the
necessary licenses would be available or available on acceptable terms.because of technological
changes in the computer and consumer electronics industries, current extensive
patent coverage, and the rapid rate of issuance of new patents, it is possible
certain components of the companys products and business methods may
unknowingly infringe existing patents of others. the company has from time to
time been notified that it may be infringing certain patents or other
intellectual property rights of others. responding to such claims, regardless
of their merit, can be time-consuming, result in significant expenses, and
cause the diversion of management and technical personnel. several pending
claims are in various stages of evaluation. the company may consider the
desirability of entering into licensing agreements in certain of these cases.
however, no assurance can be given that such licenses can be obtained on
acceptable terms or that litigation will not occur. in the event there is a
temporary or permanent injunction entered prohibiting the company from
marketing or selling certain of its products or a successful claim of
infringement against the company requiring it to pay royalties to a
third-party, the companys future operating results and financial condition
could be adversely affected. information regarding certain claims and
litigation involving the company related to alleged patent infringement and
other matters is set forth in part i, item 3 of this form 10-k.
in the opinion of management, the company does not have a potential liability
for damages or royalties from any current legal proceedings or claims related
to the infringement of patent or other intellectual property rights of others
that would individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on
its results of operations or financial condition. however, the results of such
legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty. should the company fail
to prevail in any of the matters related to infringement of patent or other
intellectual property rights of others described in part i, item 3 of this
form 10-k or should several of these matters be resolved against the
company in the same reporting period, the operating results of a particular
reporting period could be materially adversely affected.the companys retail initiative has required and will
continue to require a substantial investment and commitment of resources and is
subject to numerous risks and uncertainties.through september 30, 2006, the company had
opened 165 retail stores. the companys retail initiative has required
substantial investment in equipment and leasehold improvements, information
systems, inventory, and personnel. the company has also entered into
substantial operating lease commitments for retail space with lease terms
ranging from 5 to 20 years, the majority of which are for 10 years. the company
could incur substantial costs should it choose to terminate these commitments
or close individual stores. such costs could adversely affect the companys
results of operations and financial condition. additionally, a relatively high
proportion of the retail segments costs are fixed because of personnel costs,28



seq.=1,folio='28',file='c:\jms\skumar\06-25759-2\task1586490\25759-2-de.htm',user='105032',cd='dec 29 04:51 2006'depreciation of store construction costs, and lease
expense. as a result, significant losses would result should the retail segment
experience a significant decline in sales for any reason.certain of the companys stores
have been designed and built to serve as high-profile venues that function
as vehicles for general corporate marketing, corporate events, and brand
awareness. because of their unique design elements, locations and size, these
stores require substantially more investment in equipment and leasehold improvements than the companys more typical
retail stores. the company has opened eight such stores through september 2006.
because of their location and size, these high-profile stores also require the
company to enter into substantially larger operating lease commitments compared
to those required for its more typical stores. current leases on such locations
have terms ranging from 10 to 14 years with total remaining commitments per location
ranging from $4 million to $33 million. closure or poor performance of one of
these high-profile stores could have a significant negative impact on the
companys results of operations and financial condition.many of the general risks
and uncertainties the company faces could also have an adverse impact on its
retail segment. also, many factors unique to retail operations present risks and uncertainties, some of which
are beyond the companys control, that could adversely affect the retail
segments future results, cause its actual results to differ from those
currently expected, and/or have an adverse effect on the companys consolidated
results of operations. potential risks and uncertainties unique to retail
operations that could have an adverse impact on the retail segment include,
among other things, macro-economic factors that have a negative impact on
general retail activity; inability to manage costs associated with store
construction and operation; inability to sell third-party hardware and software
products at adequate margins; failure to manage relationships with existing
retail channel partners; lack of experience in managing retail operations
outside the u.s.; costs associated with unanticipated fluctuations in the value
of apple-branded and third-party retail inventory; and inability to obtain and
renew leases in quality retail locations at a reasonable cost.investment in new business strategies and initiatives
could disrupt the companys ongoing business and may present risks not originally
contemplated.the company has and may in
the future invest in new business strategies or engage in acquisitions that
complement the companys strategic direction and product roadmap. such
endeavors may involve significant risks and uncertainties, including
distraction of managements attention away from current business operations;
insufficient revenue generation to offset liabilities assumed and expenses
associated with the strategy; and unidentified issues not discovered in the
companys due diligence process. because these new ventures are inherently
risky, no assurance can be given that such strategies and initiatives will be
successful and will not materially adversely affect the companys business,
operating results or financial condition.declines in the sales of the companys professional
products, software, accessories, or service and support contracts, or increases
in sales of consumer products, including ipods, may negatively impact the
companys gross margin and operating margin percentages.the companys professional products, including macbook
pro and mac pro systems, software, accessories, and service and support
contracts, generally have higher gross margins than the companys consumer
products, including the imac, mac mini, macbook, ipod, and content from the
itunes store. a shift in sales mix away from higher margin professional
products towards lower margin consumer products could adversely affect the
companys future gross margin and operating margin percentages. the companys
traditional professional customers may choose to buy consumer products,
specifically the imac and macbook, instead of professional products.
professional users may choose to buy the imac due to its relative price
performance and unique design featuring a flat panel screen. professional users
may also choose to purchase macbooks instead of the companys
professional-oriented portable products due to their price performance and
screen size. additionally, significant future growth in ipod sales without29

could also reduce gross margin and operating margin percentages.the company expects
its quarterly revenue and operating results to fluctuate for a variety of
reasons.the companys profit
margins vary among its products and its distribution channels. the companys
direct sales, primarily through its retail and online stores, generally have
higher associated profitability than its indirect sales. as a result, the
companys gross margin and operating margin percentages, as well as overall
profitability may be adversely impacted as a result of a shift in product,
geographic or channel mix, or new product announcements, including the
transition to intel-based macintosh computers. in addition, the company
generally sells more product during the third month of each quarter than it
does during either of the first two months, a pattern typical in the personal
computer and consumer electronics industries. this sales pattern can produce
pressure on the companys internal infrastructure during the third month of a
quarter and may adversely impact the companys ability to predict its financial
results accurately. furthermore, the company has typically experienced greater
net sales in the first and fourth fiscal quarters compared to other quarters in
the fiscal year due to seasonal demand related to the holiday season and the
beginning of the school year. developments late in a quarter, such as
lower-than-anticipated demand for the companys products, an internal systems
failure, or failure of one of the companys key logistics, components
suppliers, or manufacturing partners, could have significant adverse impacts on
the company and its results of operations and financial condition.the company has higher research and development and
selling, general and administrative costs, as a percentage of revenue, than
many of its competitors.the companys ability to
compete successfully and maintain attractive gross margins and revenue growth
is heavily dependent upon its ability to ensure a continuing and timely flow of
innovative and competitive products and technologies to the marketplace. as a
result, the company generally incurs higher research and development costs as a
percentage of revenue than its competitors who sell personal computers based on
other operating systems. many of these competitors seek to compete aggressively
on price and maintain very low cost structures. further, as a result of the
expansion of the companys retail segment and costs associated with marketing
the companys brand including its unique operating system, the company incurs
higher selling costs as a percentage of revenue than many of its competitors.
if the company is unable to continue to develop and sell innovative new
products with attractive gross margins, its results of operations may be
materially adversely affected by its operating cost structure.the company is exposed to credit risk on its accounts
receivable and prepayments related to long-term supply agreements. this risk is
heightened during periods when economic conditions worsen.the company distributes
its products through third-party computer resellers and retailers and directly
to certain educational institutions and commercial customers. a substantial
majority of the companys outstanding trade receivables are not covered by
collateral or credit insurance. the company also has unsecured non-trade
receivables from certain of its manufacturing vendors resulting from the sale
by the company of raw material components to these manufacturing vendors who manufacture
sub-assemblies or assemble final products for the company. in addition, the
company has entered into long-term supply agreements to secure supply of nand
flash-memory and has prepaid a total of $1.25 billion under these agreements.
while the company has procedures in place to monitor and limit exposure to
credit risk on its trade and non-trade receivables as well as long-term
prepayments, there can be no assurance such procedures will be effective in
limiting its credit risk and avoiding losses. additionally, if the global
economy or regional economies deteriorate, the company would be more likely to
incur a material loss or losses as a result of the weakening financial
condition of one or more of its customers or manufacturing vendors.30

success depends largely on its ability to attract and retain key personnel.much of the future success
of the company depends on the continued service and availability of skilled
personnel, including its chief executive officer, members of its executive
team, and those in technical, marketing and staff positions. experienced
personnel in the information technology industry are in high demand and
competition for their talents is intense, especially in the silicon valley,
where the majority of the companys key employees are located. the company has
relied on its ability to grant stock options as one mechanism for recruiting
and retaining this highly skilled talent. recent accounting regulations
requiring the expensing of stock options have resulted in increased stock-based
compensation expense, which may cause the company to reduce the amount of
stock-based awards issued to employees. there can be no assurance that the
company will continue to successfully attract and retain key personnel.the company is subject
to risks associated with the availability and coverage of insurance.for certain risks, the
company does not maintain insurance coverage because of cost and/or
availability. because the company retains some portion of its insurable risks,
and in some cases self insures completely, unforeseen or catastrophic losses in
excess of insured limits may have a material adverse effect on the companys
results of operations and financial position.failure of information technology systems and breaches
in the security of data upon which the company relies could adversely affect the
companys future operating results.information technology
system failures and breaches of data security could disrupt the companys
ability to function in the normal course of business by potentially causing
delays or cancellation of customer orders, impeding the manufacture or shipment
of products, or resulting in the unintentional disclosure of customer or
company information. management has taken steps to address these concerns for its
own systems by implementing sophisticated network security and internal control
measures. however, there can be no assurance that a system failure or data
security breach of the company or a third-party vendor will not have a material
adverse effect on the companys results of operations.the companys
business is subject to the risks of international operations.a large portion of the companys revenue is derived
from its international operations. as a result, the companys operating results
and financial condition could be significantly affected by risks associated
with international activities, including economic and labor conditions,
political instability, tax laws (including u.s. taxes on foreign subsidiaries),
and changes in the value of the u.s. dollar versus the local currency in which
the products are sold and goods and services are purchased. the companys
primary exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates relate to
non-u.s. dollar denominated sales in europe, japan, australia, canada, and
certain parts of asia and non-dollar denominated operating expenses incurred
throughout the world. weaknesses in foreign currencies, particularly the
japanese yen and the euro, can adversely impact consumer demand for the
companys products and the u.s. dollar value of the companys foreign currency
denominated sales. conversely, a strengthening in these and other foreign
currencies can cause the company to modify international pricing and affect the
value of the companys foreign denominated sales, and in some cases, may also
increase the cost to the company of some product components.margins on sales of the companys products in foreign
countries, and on sales of products that include components obtained from
foreign suppliers, can be adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate
fluctuations and by international trade regulations, including tariffs and
antidumping penalties.derivative instruments, such as foreign exchange
forward and option positions have been utilized by the company to hedge
exposures to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. the use of such
hedging activities may not offset more than a portion of the adverse financial
impact resulting from unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates.31

be found in part ii, item 8 of this form 10-k at notes 1 and 3
of notes to consolidated financial statements.the company is
subject to risks associated with environmental regulations.production and marketing
of products in certain states and countries may subject the company to
environmental and other regulations including, in some instances, the
requirement to provide customers the ability to return product at the end of
its useful life, and place responsibility for environmentally safe disposal or
recycling with the company. such laws and regulations have recently been passed
in several jurisdictions in which the company operates, including various
european union member countries, japan and certain states within the u.s.
although the company does not anticipate any material adverse effects in the
future based on the nature of its operations and the thrust of such laws, there
is no assurance such existing laws or future laws will not have a material
adverse effect on the companys financial condition, liquidity, or results of
operations.changes in
accounting rules could affect the companys future operating results.financial statements are
prepared in accordance with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles.
these principles are subject to interpretation by various governing bodies,
including the financial accounting standards board (fasb) and the sec, who
create and interpret appropriate accounting standards. a change from current
accounting standards could have a significant effect on the companys results
of operations. in december 2004, the fasb issued new guidance that
addresses the accounting for share-based payments, statement of financial
accounting standards (sfas) no. 123 (revised 2004) (sfas no. 123r),
share-based payment, which the company
adopted in 2006. in 2006, stock-based compensation expense reduced diluted
earnings per common share by approximately $0.14. although the adoption of sfas
no. 123r is expected to continue to have a significant impact on the
companys results of operations, future changes to various assumptions used to
determine the fair-value of awards issued or the amount and type of equity
awards granted create uncertainty as to the amount of future stock-based
compensation expense.changes in the
companys tax rates could affect its future results.the companys future
effective tax rates could be favorably or unfavorably affected by changes in
the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in
the valuation of the companys deferred tax assets and liabilities, or by
changes in tax laws or their interpretation. in addition, the company is
subject to the continuous examination of its income tax returns by the internal
revenue service and other tax authorities. the company regularly assesses the
likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine
the adequacy of its provision for income taxes. there can be no assurance the
outcomes from these continuous examinations will not have an adverse effect on
the companys results of operations and financial condition.the companys stock
price may be volatile.the companys stock has at
times experienced substantial price volatility as a result of variations
between its actual and anticipated financial results and as a result of
announcements by the company and its competitors. the stock market has
experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market
price of many technology companies in ways that may have been unrelated to the
operating performance of these companies. furthermore, the company believes its
stock price reflects high future growth and profitability expectations. if the
company fails to meet these expectations its stock price may significantly
decline. in addition, increases in the companys stock price may result in
greater dilution of earnings per share.32

personal computers and related software, services, peripherals, and networking
solutions. the company also designs, develops, and markets a line of portable
digital music players along with related accessories and services including the
online distribution of third-party music, audio books, music videos, short
films, television shows, movies, and ipod games. the companys products and
services include the macintosh line of desktop and notebook computers, the ipod
line of portable digital music players, the xserve server and xserve raid
storage products, a portfolio of consumer and professional software
applications, the mac os x operating system, the itunes store, a portfolio of
peripherals that support and enhance the macintosh and ipod product lines, and
a variety of other service and support offerings. the company sells its
products worldwide through its online stores, its retail stores, its direct
sales force, and third-party wholesalers, resellers, and value-added resellers.
in addition, the company sells a variety of third-party macintosh and ipod
compatible products including application software, printers, storage devices,
speakers, headphones, and various other accessories and supplies through its
online and retail stores. the company sells to education, consumer, creative
professional, business, and government customers. a further description of the
companys products may be found in part i, item 1 of this form 10-k
under the heading business.the company believes that for both professionals and
consumers the personal computer has become the center of an evolving digital
lifestyle by integrating and enhancing the utility of advanced digital devices
such as the companys ipods, digital video and still cameras, televisions, cd
and dvd players, cellular phones, personal digital assistants, and other
consumer electronic devices. the attributes of the personal computer that
enable this functionality include a high-quality user interface, easy access to
relatively inexpensive data storage, the ability to run complex applications,
and the ability to connect easily to a wide variety of other digital devices
and to the internet. the company is the only participant in the personal
computer industry that controls the design and development of the entire
personal computer-from the hardware and operating system to sophisticated
applications. this, along with its products innovative industrial designs,
intuitive ease-of-use, built-in graphics, multimedia and networking
capabilities, uniquely positions the company to offer innovative integrated
digital lifestyle solutions.the companys business strategy leverages its ability,
through the design and development of its own operating system, hardware, and many
software applications and technologies, to bring to its customers around the
world compelling new products and solutions with superior ease-of-use, seamless
integration, and innovative industrial design.the company participates in several highly competitive
markets, including personal computers with its macintosh line of computers,
consumer electronics with its ipod line of portable digital music players, and
distribution of third-party digital content through its online itunes store. while
the company is widely recognized as an innovator in the personal computer and
consumer electronic markets as well as a leader in the emerging market for
distribution of digital content, these are all highly competitive markets that
are subject to aggressive pricing and increased competition. to remain
competitive, the company believes increased investment in research and
development (r&d) and marketing and advertising is necessary to maintain
and extend its position in the markets where it competes. the companys r&d
spending is focused on delivering timely updates and enhancements to its
existing line of personal computers, displays, operating systems, software
applications, and portable digital music players; developing new digital
lifestyle consumer and professional software applications; and investing in new
product areas such as rack-mount servers, raid storage systems, and wireless
technologies. the company also believes investment in marketing and advertising
programs is critical to increasing product and brand awareness.49

begin using intel microprocessors in its computers. during 2006, the company
introduced new intel-based models of the macbook pro, macbook, mac pro, imac,
and mac mini computers. the companys transition to intel microprocessors for
macintosh systems was completed in august 2006, and its transition for
xserve was completed in november 2006. the macbook pro, macbook, mac pro,
imac, and mac mini feature mac os x version 10.4 tiger, ilife 06, and the
companys new translation technology, rosetta, which allows most powerpc-based
macintosh applications to run on intel-based macintosh computers. there are
potential risks and uncertainties that may occur due to this transition, which
are further discussed in item 1a under the heading risk factors.the company utilizes a variety of direct and indirect
distribution channels. the company believes sales of its innovative and
differentiated products are enhanced by knowledgeable salespersons who can
convey the value of the hardware, software, and peripheral integration,
demonstrate the unique digital lifestyle solutions that are available only on
macintosh computers, and demonstrate the compatibility of the macintosh with
the windows platform and networks. the company further believes providing a
high-quality sales and after-sales support experience is critical to attracting
and retaining customers. to ensure a high-quality buying experience for its
products in which service and education are emphasized, the company has
expanded and improved its distribution capabilities by opening its own retail
stores in the u.s. and internationally. the company had 165 stores open as of september 30,
2006.the company also staffs selected third-party stores
with the companys own employees to improve the buying experience through
reseller channels. the company has deployed apple employees and contractors in
reseller locations around the world including the u.s., europe, japan, and
australia. the company also sells to customers directly through its online
stores around the world.to improve access to the
ipod product line, the company has significantly expanded the number of
distribution points where ipods are sold. the ipod product line can be
purchased in certain department stores, member-only warehouse stores, large
retail chains, and specialty retail stores, as well as through the channels
listed above.critical accounting
policies and estimatesthe preparation of financial statements and related
disclosures in conformity with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles
and the companys discussion and analysis of its financial condition and
results of operations require the companys management to make judgments,
assumptions, and estimates that affect the amounts reported in its consolidated
financial statements and accompanying notes. note 1 of the notes to
consolidated financial statements of this form 10-k describes the
significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the
companys consolidated financial statements. management bases its estimates on
historical experience and on various other assumptions it believes to be
reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for
making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. actual
results may differ from these estimates and such differences may be material.management believes the
companys critical accounting policies and estimates are those related to
revenue recognition, allowance for doubtful accounts, inventory valuation and
inventory purchase commitments, warranty costs, stock-based compensation, and
income taxes. management believes these policies to be critical because they
are both important to the portrayal of the companys financial condition and
results, and they require management to make judgments and estimates about
matters that are inherently uncertain. the companys senior management has
reviewed these critical accounting policies and related disclosures with the
audit and finance committee of the companys board of directors.revenue recognitionnet sales consist primarily of revenue from the sale
of hardware, software, peripherals, digital content, and service and support
contracts. the company recognizes revenue pursuant to applicable accounting50



seq.=1,folio='50',file='c:\fc\36111332643_d11651_1583404\25759-2-di.htm',user='jmsproofassembler',cd='dec 27 11:34 2006'standards, including american institute of certified
public accountants statement of position (sop) no. 97-2, software revenue recognition, as amended, and sec staff
accounting bulletin (sab) no. 104, revenue recognition.the company recognizes revenue when persuasive
evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the sales price is
fixed or determinable, and collection is probable. product is considered
delivered to the customer once it has been shipped, and title and risk of loss
have been transferred. for most of the companys product sales, these criteria
are met at the time the product is shipped. for online sales to individuals,
for some sales to education customers in the u.s., and for certain other sales,
the company defers revenue until the customer receives the product because the
company retains a portion of the risk of loss on these sales during transit. if
at the outset of an arrangement the company determines the arrangement fee is
not, or is presumed not to be, fixed or determinable, revenue is deferred and
subsequently recognized as amounts become due and payable and all other
criteria for revenue recognition have been met.the company records
reductions to revenue for estimated commitments related to price protection and
for customer incentive programs, including reseller and end-user rebates, and
other sales programs and volume-based incentives. for transactions involving
price protection, the company recognizes revenue net of the estimated amount to
be refunded, provided the refund amount can be reasonably and reliably
estimated and the other conditions for revenue recognition have been met. if
refunds cannot be reliably estimated, revenue is not recognized until reliable
estimates can be made or the price protection lapses. for customer incentive
programs, the estimated cost of these programs is recognized at the later of
the date at which the company has sold the product or the date at which the
program is offered. the company also records reductions to revenue for expected
future product returns based on the companys historical experience. future
market conditions and product transitions may require the company to increase
customer incentive programs and incur incremental price protection obligations
that could result in additional reductions to revenue at the time such programs
are offered. additionally, certain customer incentive programs require
management to estimate the number of customers who will actually redeem the
incentive based on historical experience and the specific terms and conditions
of particular incentive programs. if a greater than estimated proportion of
customers redeem such incentives, the company would be required to record
additional reductions to revenue, which could have a material adverse impact on
the companys results of operations.allowance for
doubtful accountsthe company distributes its products through
third-party distributors and resellers and directly to certain education,
consumer, and commercial customers. the company generally does not require
collateral from its customers; however, the company will require collateral in
certain instances to limit credit risk. in addition, when possible, the company
does attempt to limit credit risk on trade receivables with credit insurance
for certain customers in latin america, europe, asia, and australia and by
arranging with third-party financing companies to provide flooring arrangements
and other loan and lease programs to the companys direct customers. these
credit-financing arrangements are directly between the third-party financing
company and the end customer. as such, the company generally does not assume
any recourse or credit risk sharing related to any of these arrangements.
however, considerable trade receivables that are not covered by collateral,
third-party flooring arrangements, or credit insurance are outstanding with the
companys distribution and retail channel partners.the
allowance for doubtful accounts is based on managements assessment of
the collectibility of specific customer accounts and includes consideration of
the credit worthiness and financial condition of those specific customers. the company records an allowance to reduce
the specific receivables to the amount that is reasonably believed to be
collectible. the company also records an
allowance for all other trade receivables based on multiple factors including historical
experience with bad debts, the general economic51



seq.=1,folio='51',file='c:\fc\36111332643_d11651_1583404\25759-2-di.htm',user='jmsproofassembler',cd='dec 27 11:34 2006'environment, the financial
condition of the companys distribution channels, and the aging of such receivables. if there is a deterioration of a major
customers financial condition, if the company becomes aware of additional
information related to the credit worthiness of a major customer, or if future
actual default rates on trade receivables in general differ from those
currently anticipated, the company may have to adjust its allowance for
doubtful accounts, which would affect earnings in the period the adjustments
were made.inventory valuation and inventory purchase commitmentsthe company must order components for its products and
build inventory in advance of product shipments. the company records a
write-down for inventories of components and products, including third-party
products held for resale, which have become obsolete or are in excess of anticipated
demand or net realizable value. the company performs a detailed review of
inventory each fiscal quarter that considers multiple factors including demand
forecasts, product life cycle status, product development plans, current sales
levels, and component cost trends. the personal computer and consumer
electronic industries are subject to a rapid and unpredictable pace of product
and component obsolescence and demand changes. if future demand or market
conditions for the companys products are less favorable than forecasted or if
unforeseen technological changes negatively impact the utility of component
inventory, the company may be required to record additional write-downs which
would negatively affect gross margins in the period when the write-downs were
recorded.the company accrues
reserves for estimated cancellation fees related to component orders that have
been cancelled or are expected to be cancelled. consistent with industry
practice, the company acquires components through a combination of purchase
orders, supplier contracts, and open orders based on projected demand
information. these commitments typically cover the companys requirements for
periods ranging from 30 to 150 days. if there is an abrupt and substantial
decline in demand for one or more of the companys products or an unanticipated
change in technological requirements for any of the companys products, the
company may be required to record additional reserves for cancellation fees
that would negatively affect gross margins in the period when the cancellation
fees are identified.warranty coststhe company provides currently for the estimated cost
for hardware and software warranties at the time the related revenue is
recognized based on historical and projected warranty claim rates, historical
and projected cost-per-claim, and knowledge of specific product failures that
are outside of the companys typical experience. each quarter, the company
reevaluates its estimates to assess the adequacy of its recorded warranty
liabilities considering the size of the installed base of products subject to
warranty protection and adjusts the amounts as necessary. if actual product failure rates or repair costs
differ from estimates, revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be
required and could negatively affect the companys results of
operations.the company periodically
provides updates to its applications and system software to maintain the
softwares compliance with specifications. the estimated cost to develop such
updates is accounted for as warranty costs that are recognized at the time
related software revenue is recognized. factors considered in determining
appropriate accruals related to such updates include the number of units
delivered, the number of updates expected to occur, and the historical cost and
estimated future cost of the resources necessary to develop these updates.stock-based
compensationthe company accounts for stock-based compensation in
accordance with sfas no. 123r. under the provisions of sfas no. 123r,
stock-based compensation cost is estimated at the grant date based on the awards
fair value as calculated by the black-scholes-merton (bsm) option-pricing
model and is recognized as expense ratably over the requisite service period. the
bsm model requires various highly52



seq.=1,folio='52',file='c:\fc\36111332643_d11651_1583404\25759-2-di.htm',user='jmsproofassembler',cd='dec 27 11:34 2006'judgmental assumptions including volatility,
forfeiture rates, and expected option life. if any of the assumptions used in
the bsm model change significantly, stock-based compensation expense may differ
materially in the future from that recorded in the current period.in connection with the
companys restatement of its consolidated financial statements, the company has
applied judgment in choosing whether to revise measurement dates for prior
option grants. information regarding the restatement, including ranges of
possible additional stock-based compensation expense if other measurement dates
had been selected for certain grants, is set forth in the explanatory note
immediately preceding part i, item 1 and in note 2, restatement of
consolidated financial statements in notes to consolidated financial
statements of this form 10-k.income taxesthe company records a tax provision for the
anticipated tax consequences of the reported results of operations. in
accordance with sfas no. 109, accounting for income
taxes, the provision for income taxes is computed using the asset
and liability method, under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are
recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between
the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, and for
operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. deferred tax assets and
liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to
taxable income in effect for the years in which those tax assets are expected
to be realized or settled. the company records a valuation allowance to reduce
deferred tax assets to the amount that is believed more likely than not to be
realized.management believes it is more likely than not that
forecasted income, including income that may be generated as a result of
certain tax planning strategies, together with the tax effects of the deferred
tax liabilities, will be sufficient to fully recover the remaining deferred tax
assets. in the event that all or part of the net deferred tax assets are
determined not to be realizable in the future, an adjustment to the valuation
allowance would be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made.
similarly, if the company subsequently realizes deferred tax assets that were
previously determined to be unrealizable, the respective valuation allowance
would be reversed, resulting in a positive adjustment to earnings in the period
such determination is made. in addition, the calculation of tax liabilities
involves significant judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the
application of complex tax laws. resolution of these uncertainties in a manner
inconsistent with managements expectations could have a material impact on the
companys results of operations and financial position.53

2006 increased 39% or $5.4 billion from 2005. this increase was due in part to
the fact that 2006 spanned 53 weeks while 2005 spanned 52 weeks. several other
factors contributed to these increases including the following:·       net sales of ipods increased $3.1 billion or 69% during 2006
compared to 2005. unit sales of ipods totaled 39.4 million in 2006, which
represents an increase of 75% from 22.5 million ipod units sold in 2005. strong
ipod sales during 2006 reflected significant sales of both the hard-drive based ipod that supports video,
first introduced in october of 2005 and the ipod nano, introduced in september 2005,
as well as continued expansion of ipod distribution points. during 2006,
the net sales per ipod unit sold decreased by 3% compared to 2005 primarily due
to an overall decrease in average selling prices for all ipods as well as a
shift in product mix to the ipod nano. from the introduction of the ipod in
2002 through 2006, the company has sold approximately 68 million ipods.·       macintosh net sales
increased $1.1 billion or 18% during 2006 compared to 2005. macintosh unit
sales increased by 769,000 units or 17% during 2006 compared to 2005. these increases were mainly due to strong demand
for the intel-based macbook and macbook pro systems and reflect a shift in
product mix to portable products in all of the companys operating segments. net
sales and unit sales of the companys portable products increased 43% and 42%,
respectively, during 2006 compared to 2005. macintosh desktop net sales and
unit sales both decreased by 3% during 2006 compared to 2005. the decrease in
sales of the companys macintosh desktops was due to declines in sales of the
companys professional-oriented desktop products. the company believes the
decline in the companys professional-oriented desktop products was due to
customers delaying purchases of such products in anticipation of the release of
the intel-based mac pro, which did not begin shipping until august 2006,
and updated software applications capable of running on intel-based macintosh
computers, and the trend toward portable computers. a slight increase of 1%
during 2006 in net sales per macintosh unit sold was due to a shift in mix to
higher-priced portable products, partially offset by price reductions on
certain macintosh systems.·       other
music related products and services consists of sales associated with the
itunes store and ipod services and accessories. net sales of other music
related products and services increased $986 million or 110% during 2006
compared to 2005. the increase was primarily due to increased net sales from
the itunes store and apple-branded and third-party ipod accessories and
services. the increase in sales from the itunes store stemmed from significant
growth in u.s. sales and the opening of the itunes store in japan during august 2005
and australia during october 2005. the increased sales from the itunes
store were also attributable to the availability of videos, television shows,
and feature-length movie downloads.·       net sales of software,
service, and other sales increased $188 million or 17% during 2006 compared to
2005. the growth was primarily attributable to increased net sales of applecare protection plan (app) extended service
and support contracts and application software, partially offset by a
decrease in sales of mac os x. mac os x
sales were particularly high in 2005 due to the release of mac os x tiger in april 2005.offsetting the
favorable factors discussed above, the companys net sales during 2006 were
negatively impacted by the following:·       net sales of peripherals and other hardware declined $26 million
or 2% compared to 2005 primarily due to price decreases and a decrease in net
sales of displays relating to a shift in mix from desktop to portable systems. the
decrease in net sales of displays for 2006 is consistent with the overall
decrease in unit sales of macintosh professional desktop systems.55fiscal year 2005 versus 2004during 2005, net
sales increased 68% or $5.7 billion from 2004. several factors contributed
favorably to net sales during 2005:·       net sales of ipods rose $3.2 billion or 248% during 2005 compared
to 2004. unit sales of ipods totaled 22.5 million in 2005, which represented an
increase of 409% from the 4.4 million ipod units sold in 2004. strong sales of
ipods during 2005 were experienced in all of the companys operating segments
and was driven by strong demand for the ipod
shuffle introduced in january 2005, the release of an updated version of
the ipod mini in february 2005, the release of the ipod nano in september 2005,
and expansion of the ipods distribution network. net sales per ipod
unit sold decreased 32% primarily due to the introduction of the lower priced
ipod shuffle in january 2005 and ipod mini pricing reductions in february 2005.
from the introduction of the ipod in 2002 through 2005, the company had sold
approximately 28 million ipods.·       net
sales of other music related products and services increased $621 million or
223% during 2005 compared to 2004. the company experienced strong growth in
sales of ipod services and accessories consistent with the increase in overall
ipod unit sales for 2005. the increased sales from the itunes store were
primarily due to substantial growth of net sales in the u.s. and expansion in
europe, canada, and japan.·       total
macintosh net sales increased $1.4 billion or 27% during 2005 compared to 2004.
unit sales of macintosh systems increased 1.2 million units or 38% during 2005
compared to 2004. the increases in macintosh net sales and unit sales related
primarily to strong demand for the companys desktop products, which was
experienced in all of the companys operating segments. the company believes
that the success of the ipod had a positive impact on macintosh net sales by
introducing new customers to the companys other products. desktop demand was
stimulated in 2005 due to the imac g5 and the introduction of the mac mini in january 2005.
net sales and unit sales of desktop products increased 45% and 55%,
respectively, during 2005 compared to 2004. macintosh net sales and unit sales
also included sales of the companys portable products, which increased 11% and
21%, respectively, compared to 2004.net sales per macintosh
unit sold decreased 7% on a year-over-year basis. the decrease was the result
of changes in the overall unit mix towards relatively lower-priced consumer
products, specifically the impact of the mac mini product, and desktop and
portable price reductions. this decrease was partially offset by an increase in
the proportion of direct sales.·       net
sales of peripherals and other hardware rose by 18% during 2005 compared to
2004 primarily due to an increase in net sales of displays and other computer
accessories. net sales of other
hardware include airport cards and base stations, xserve raid storage, isight
digital video cameras, and third-party hardware products.·       net sales of software, service and other sales
rose $270 million or 33% during 2005 compared to 2004. this growth was
primarily attributable to increased net sales in app extended service and
support contracts, driven primarily by higher associated macintosh computer
sales. additionally, the company experienced increases in net sales of .mac
internet service, professional and consumer applications, third-party software,
and mac os x that was primarily attributable to the release of version 10.4
tiger in april 2005.segment operating
performancethe company manages its
business primarily on a geographic basis. the companys reportable operating
segments are comprised of the americas, europe, japan, and retail. the
americas, europe, and japan reportable segments do not include activities
related to the retail segment. the americas segment includes both north and
south america. the europe segment includes european countries as well as the56middle east and africa.
the retail segment operated apple-owned retail stores in the u.s., canada,
japan, and the u.k. during 2006. each reportable geographic operating segment
provides similar hardware and software products and similar services. further
information regarding the companys operating segments may be found in note 11,
segment information and geographic data in notes to consolidated financial
statements of this form 10-k.americasduring 2006, net sales in the americas segment
increased $2.7 billion, or 41%, compared to 2005. the main factors for this
increase were significant increases in net sales of ipods, other music related
products and services, macintosh portable systems, and app. sales of ipods
increased primarily due to the introduction of the updated ipod with
video-playing capabilities in october 2005 and the ipod nano during september 2005.
the increase in other music related products and services was due to increases
in sales of apple-branded and third-party ipod accessories and sales from the
itunes store. the increase in sales of macintosh portable systems in the
americas was due to strong sales of the intel-based macbook and macbook pro
during 2006. the overall increase in net sales was partially offset by a
decline in net sales of desktops, displays, and mac os x. the decrease in
desktop products and displays net sales reflects the overall shift in product
mix toward portable macintosh systems. mac os x sales decreased from 2005 since
the company has not released a new version of mac os x since tiger began
shipping in april 2005. during 2006, the americas segment represented
approximately 48% of the companys total net sales as compared to 47% in the
same period of 2005. during 2006, u.s. education channel net sales and
macintosh unit sales increased by 13% and 11%, respectively, compared to 2005.
net sales from the higher education market grew 22% during 2006 compared to
2005 due to strong sales of macintosh portable products and ipods. net sales
were relatively flat for k-12 due to continued budget constraints.during 2005, net sales in
the americas segment grew 64% or $2.6 billion compared to 2004. the increase in
net sales during 2005 was primarily attributable to the significant
year-over-year increase in ipod sales, sales of other music related products
and services, and strong sales of desktop and portable macintosh systems. this
increase was partially offset by a shift in sales to the retail segment, which
had 117 stores in the u.s. and canada as of the end of 2005. macintosh unit
sales also increased by 30% in 2005 compared to 2004, driven primarily by
strong sales of desktop systems largely attributable to strong sales from the
updated imac, which began shipping in september 2004, and the mac mini,
which was introduced in january 2005. during 2005 and 2004, the americas
segment represented approximately 47% and 49%, respectively, of the companys
total net sales and represented approximately 48% and 51%, respectively, of
total macintosh unit sales. the company experienced an increase in both u.s.
education channel net sales and unit sales of 21% for 2005 compared to 2004.
strength in higher education sales related primarily to strong imac and
portable system shipments. this strength drove year-over-year growth in net
sales of 32% for the higher education channel during 2005. despite challenges
in the k-12 market from continued budget constraints and competitive
pressures, the companys k-12 net sales grew year-over-year by 11% during
2005 due to increased ibook sales and 1:1 education sales.europeeurope segment net sales increased $1.0 billion or 33%
during 2006 compared to 2005. consistent with the americas segment, these
increases were a result of strong growth in ipod sales, other music related
products and services, and macintosh portable systems. sales of ipods increased
primarily due to the introduction of the updated ipod with video-playing
capabilities in october 2005 and the ipod nano during september 2005.
the increase in other music related products and services was due to increases
in sales of apple-branded and third-party ipod accessories and sales from the
itunes store. the increase in sales of portable systems in europe was due to
strong sales of the intel-based macbook and macbook pro that were introduced
during 2006. in addition, europe also reported increased sales in app related
to the increase in macintosh unit sales. these increases were partially offset
by a decrease in desktop and57mac os x net sales during 2006 compared to
2005. the decrease in desktop net sales was due to the shift in product mix toward
portable macintosh systems. mac os x sales have decreased from 2005 since the
company has not released a new version of mac os x since tiger began shipping
in april 2005.during 2005, net sales in
the europe segment grew $1.3 billion or 71% from 2004. total macintosh unit
sales in europe also experienced growth during the current year by increasing
47% in 2005 compared to 2004. consistent with the americas segment, europe
experienced strong net sales of desktop products, ipod, other music related
products and services, and software and service sales. demand in europe during
2005 was particularly strong for the companys desktop computers, which
experienced a year-over-year increase of 56% from 2004. similar to the results
of the companys other segments, net sales of ipods, peripherals and software
were strong in 2005.japanjapans net sales increased $288 million or 31% during
2006 compared to 2005. the japan segment experienced increased net sales in
ipods, macintosh portable products,
and other music related products and services. consistent with the companys
other segments, japan experienced increases in sales of ipods due to the
introduction of the ipod with video-playing capabilities and the ipod nano in october and
september of 2005, respectively. japan also experienced strong sales of
the intel-based macbook and increased sales from the itunes store. these
increases were partially offset by decreases in net sales of macintosh desktop
products, displays, and mac os x. the decreases in desktop products and
displays reflect the overall shift in product mix toward portable macintosh
systems. mac os x sales have decreased from
2005 since the company has not released a new version of mac os x since tiger
began shipping in april 2005. total macintosh unit sales during
2006 remained relatively flat compared to 2005. the relatively flat growth in
macintosh unit sales is partially attributable to japans overall slow consumer
pc market growth. the company is continuing to evaluate ways to improve its
indirect and direct channel sales in japan.japans net sales and
macintosh unit sales were up 36% and 8%, respectively, during 2005 compared to
2004. japan experienced increased net sales in desktop products, ipod, and
other music related products and services. desktop net sales and unit sales
increased by 31% and 41%, respectively, and ipod sales increased by 220% during
2005 compared to 2004. the overall increase in net sales was partially offset
by a decline in portable system net sales during 2005 compared to 2004, which
the company believes might have been attributable to a shift in sales from
portables to the imac g5 and mac mini, and a shift to the retail segment as a
result of opening two additional stores in japan during 2005.retailthe company opened 41 new retail stores during 2006,
including a total of 10 international stores in the u.k., japan, and canada,
bringing the total number of open stores to 165 as of september 30, 2006. this
compares to 124 open stores as of september 24, 2005 and 86 open stores as
of september 25, 2004.the retail segments net sales increased by 43% to
$3.4 billion during 2006 compared to 2005. retail segment macintosh unit sales
increased 45% during 2006 compared to 2005.
with an average of 142 stores open during 2006, average revenue per store
increased to $23.6 million compared to $22.4 million during 2005 and $15.6
million in 2004. the current year increase was primarily due to strong
sales of macintosh portable and desktop products, ipods, and other music
related products and services. sales of
ipods increased primarily due to the introduction of the updated ipod with
video-playing capabilities in october 2005 and the ipod nano during september 2005.
the increase in other music related products and services was due to increased
sales of apple-branded and third-party ipod accessories. macintosh portable and
desktop sales increased due to strong sales of the intel-based macbook, macbook
pro, and imac.as measured by the companys operating segment
reporting, the retail segment reported operating income of $198 million during
2006 as compared to operating income of $151 million during 2005 and58operating income of $39 million during 2004. this
improvement was primarily attributable to the impact of opening new stores and
the segments year-over-year increase in average revenue per store, which
resulted in higher leverage on occupancy, depreciation, and other fixed costs.expansion of the retail
segment has required and will continue to require a substantial investment in
fixed assets and related infrastructure, operating lease commitments,
personnel, and other operating expenses. capital expenditures associated with
the retail segment were $200 million in 2006, bringing the total capital
expenditures since inception of the retail segment to approximately $729
million. as of september 30, 2006, the retail segment had approximately
5,787 employees and had outstanding operating lease commitments associated with
retail store space and related facilities of approximately $887 million. the
company would incur substantial costs if it were to close its retail stores.
such costs could adversely affect the companys results of operations and
financial condition.gross margingross

note immediately preceding part i, item 1 and note 2, restatement of
consolidated financial statements in notes to consolidated financial
statements of this form 10-k.gross margin percentage of 29.0% in 2006 remained flat
as compared to 2005. the company experienced more favorable pricing on certain
commodity components including lcd flat-panel displays and dram memory and
higher overall revenue that provided for more leverage on fixed production
costs, offset by an increase in lower margin ipod sales and other music-related
services.the company anticipates that its gross margin and the
gross margins of the personal computer and consumer electronics industries will
be under pressure due to price competition. the company expects gross margin
percentage to decline sequentially in the first quarter of 2007 primarily as a
result of a shift in the mix of revenue toward lower margin products such as
the ipod and content from the itunes store.the foregoing statements regarding the companys
expected gross margin percentage are forward-looking. there can be no assurance
that current gross margin percentage will be maintained or targeted gross
margin percentage levels will be achieved. in general, gross margins and
margins on individual products, including ipods, will remain under significant
downward pressure due to a variety of factors, including continued industry
wide global pricing pressures, increased competition, compressed product life
cycles, potential increases in the cost and availability of raw material and
outside manufacturing services, and potential changes to the companys product
mix, including higher unit sales of consumer products with lower average
selling prices and lower gross margins. in response to these competitive
pressures, the company expects it will continue to take pricing actions with
respect to its products. gross margins could also be affected by the companys
ability to effectively manage product quality and warranty costs and to
stimulate demand for certain of its products. due to the companys significant
international operations, financial results can be significantly affected in
the short-term by fluctuations in exchange rates.the company orders components for its products and
builds inventory in advance of product shipments. because the companys markets
are volatile and subject to rapid technology and price changes, there is a59risk the company will forecast incorrectly and produce
or order from third-parties excess or insufficient inventories of particular
products or components. the companys operating results and financial condition
in the past have been and may in the future be materially adversely affected by
the companys ability to manage its inventory levels and outstanding purchase
commitments and to respond to short-term shifts in customer demand
patterns.gross margin percentage
increased in 2005 to 29.0% of net sales from 27.3% of net sales in 2004. the
companys gross margin during 2005 increased due to more favorable pricing on
certain commodity components including lcd flat-panel displays and dram memory;
an increase in higher margin software sales; a favorable shift in direct sales
related primarily to the companys retail and online stores; and higher overall
revenue that provided for more leverage on fixed production costs. these
increases to gross margin were partially offset by an increase in lower margin
ipod sales.operating expensesoperating

development (r&d)expenditures for r&d
increased 33% or $177 million to $712 million in 2006 compared to $535 million
in 2005. the increase was due primarily to an increase in r&d headcount in
the current year to support expanded r&d activities, an increase of $46
million in stock-based compensation recognized as r&d expense resulting
from the adoption of sfas no. 123r, and higher overall expenses due to the 14th week added to the first fiscal quarter of
2006 to realign the companys fiscal quarters with calendar quarters. in addition, during 2005, the company
capitalized approximately $29.7 million of costs associated with the
development of mac os x tiger. no software development costs were capitalized
during 2006. further information related to the companys capitalization of
software development costs may be found in part ii, item 8 of this form 10-k
at note 1 of notes to consolidated financial statements. despite the increase
in expenditures, r&d as a percentage of net sales remained relatively flat
in 2006 as compared to 2005 due to the significant increase in revenue. the
company continues to believe that focused investments in r&d are critical
to its future growth and competitive position in the marketplace and are
directly related to timely development of new and enhanced products that are
central to the companys core business strategy. as such, the company expects
to make further investments in r&d to remain competitive.selling, general,
and administrative expense (sg&a)expenditures for sg&a increased $569 million or
31% during 2006 compared to 2005. these increases are due primarily to the
companys continued expansion of its retail segment in both domestic and
international markets, an increase of $50 million in stock-based compensation
expense recognized as60sg&a expense resulting from the adoption of sfas no. 123r,
a current year increase in discretionary spending on marketing and advertising,
higher direct and channel selling expenses resulting from the increase in net
sales and employee salary merit increases, and the expenses associated with the 14th week added to the first fiscal
quarter of 2006. despite the increase in expenditures, sg&a as a
percentage of total net sales in 2006 remained flat as compared to 2005.expenditures for sg&a
increased $434 million or 30% during 2005 compared to 2004. these increases are
due primarily to the companys continued expansion of its retail segment in
both domestic and international markets, a current year increase in
discretionary spending on marketing and advertising, and higher direct and
channel selling expenses resulting from the increase in net sales and employee
salary merit increases. sg&a as a percentage of total net sales in 2005 was
13%, down from 17% in 2004, which is due to the increase in total net sales of
68% for the company during 2005.fiscal 2004 restructuring
actionsduring 2004, the company
recorded total restructuring charges of approximately $23.0 million, including
approximately $14.0 million in severance costs, $5.5 million in asset
impairments, and $3.5 million for lease cancellations. the lease cancellations
relate to vacating a leased sales facility as a result of a european workforce
reduction during 2004. of the $23.0 million charges, $21.3 million had been
utilized by the end of 2006, with the remainder consisting of $1.7 million for
lease cancellations. these actions resulted in the termination of 452
positions.other income and

non-current investmentsthe company previously
held significant investments in arm holdings plc (arm), akamai technologies, inc. (akamai), and earthlink network, inc.
(earthlink). the company sold all of the remaining holdings in these
non-current investments in 2004 and 2003. pretax gains recorded upon the sale
of these non-current investments were $4 million in 2004.interest and other
income, nettotal interest and other income, net increased $200
million or 121% to $365 million during 2006 compared to $165 million in
2005 and $53 million in 2004. these increases are attributable primarily to
higher cash and short-term investment balances and increasing investment yields
resulting from higher market interest rates and the 14th week added to the first fiscal quarter of 2006. the
weighted average interest rate earned by the company on its cash, cash
equivalents, and short-term investments increased to 4.58% in 2006 compared to
the 2.70% and 1.38% rates earned during 2005 and 2004, respectively. the
current year increase in other income was partially offset by higher foreign
currency hedging expenses.interest expense in 2004
consisted primarily of interest on the companys $300 million aggregate
principal amount unsecured notes, which were repaid upon their maturity in february 2004.
the unsecured notes61were sold at 99.925% of
par for an effective yield to maturity of 6.51%. total deferred gain resulting
from the closure of debt swaps of approximately $23 million was fully amortized
as of the notes maturity in february 2004.provision for
income taxesthe companys effective tax rate for the year ended september 30,
2006 was approximately 29%. the companys effective rate differs from the
statutory federal income tax rate of 35% due primarily to certain undistributed
foreign earnings for which no u.s. taxes are provided because such earnings are
intended to be indefinitely reinvested outside the u.s. in addition, the
company recorded a tax benefit of $20 million due to settlement of prior year
tax audits in the u.s., and a net benefit of $20 million resulting from the
dividend repatriation under the american jobs creation act of 2004 (ajca) and
international tax planning strategies associated with the repatriation as
further discussed below.as of september 30, 2006, the company had
deferred tax assets arising from deductible temporary differences, tax losses,
and tax credits of $739 million before being offset against certain deferred
liabilities and a valuation allowance for presentation on the companys balance
sheet. management believes it is more likely than not that forecasted income,
including income that may be generated as a result of certain tax planning
strategies, together with the tax effects of the deferred tax liabilities, will
be sufficient to fully recover the remaining deferred tax assets. as of september 30,
2006 and september 24, 2005, a valuation allowance of $5 million was
recorded against the deferred tax asset for the benefits of state operating
losses that may not be realized. the company will continue to evaluate the
realizability of the deferred tax assets quarterly by assessing the need for
and amount of the valuation allowance.on october 22, 2004, the ajca was signed into law.
the ajca included a provision for the deduction of 85% of certain foreign
earnings that were repatriated, as defined in the ajca, within a specified time
frame. among other requirements, dividends qualifying for the 85% deduction
must be reinvested in the united states in certain qualified investments
pursuant to a domestic reinvestment plan approved by the ceo and board of
directors. during 2006, the company repatriated approximately $1.6 billion of
foreign earnings. of the earnings repatriated, $755 million is eligible for the
reduced tax rate provided by the ajca. accordingly, the company recorded a tax
charge of $51 million related to the repatriation of foreign earnings under the
provisions of the ajca. in addition, the company recorded a tax benefit of $71 million
resulting from the implementation of tax planning strategies to recognize
deferred tax assets that were previously not recognizable within certain
foreign subsidiaries.the internal revenue service (irs) has substantially
completed its field audit of the companys federal income tax returns for the
years 2002 through 2003 and proposed certain adjustments. the company intends
to contest certain of these adjustments through the irs appeals office. substantially
all irs audit issues for years prior to 2002 have been resolved. in addition,
the company is subject to audits by state, local, and foreign tax authorities. management
believes that adequate provision has been made for any adjustments that may
result from tax examinations. however, the outcome of tax audits cannot be
predicted with certainty. should any issues addressed in the companys tax
audits be resolved in a manner not consistent with managements expectations,
the company could be required to adjust its provision for income tax in the
period such resolution occurs.62

pronouncementsin september 2006, the sec issued sab no. 108,
considering the effects of prior year misstatements
when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements. sab
no. 108 provides guidance on how prior year misstatements should be
considered when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements
for purposes of determining whether the current years financial statements are
materially misstated. sab no. 108 is effective for fiscal years ending
after november 15, 2006. although the company will continue to evaluate
the application of sab no. 108, management does not currently believe
adoption will have a material impact on the companys results of operations or
financial position.in september 2006, the fasb issued sfas no. 157,
fair value measurements, which defines
fair value, provides a framework for measuring fair value, and expands the
disclosures required for fair value measurements. sfas no. 157 applies to
other accounting pronouncements that require fair value measurements; it does
not require any new fair value measurements. sfas no. 157 is effective for
fiscal years beginning after november 15, 2007 and is required to be
adopted by the company beginning in the66first quarter of fiscal 2009. although the company

no. (fin) 48, accounting for uncertainty
in income taxes-an interpretation of fasb statement no. 109. fin
no. 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes by

disclose in their financial statements uncertain tax positions that they have
taken or expect to take in a tax return. fin no. 48 is effective for
fiscal years beginning after december 15, 2006 and is required to be

2006, the company had $10.11 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and short-term
investments, an increase of $1.85 billion over the same balances at the end of
2005. the principal67components of this
increase were cash generated by operating activities of $2.22 billion, proceeds
of $318 million from the issuance of common stock under stock plans, and excess
tax benefits from stock-based compensation of $361 million, partially offset by
cash used to purchase property, plant, and equipment of $657 million and
repurchases of common stock of $355 million in conjunction with net-share
settlements on vested restricted stock and restricted stock units. cash
generated from operating activities includes the impact of the $1.25 billion
prepayment for nand flash memory components. the companys short-term
investment portfolio is primarily invested in high credit quality, liquid
investments. as of september 30, 2006, approximately $4.1 billion of the
companys cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments were held by
foreign subsidiaries and are generally based in u.s. dollar-denominated
holdings. amounts held by foreign subsidiaries are generally subject to u.s.
income taxation on repatriation to the u.s.the company believes its
existing balances of cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments
will be sufficient to satisfy its working capital needs, capital expenditures,
stock repurchase activity, outstanding commitments, and other liquidity
requirements associated with its existing operations over the next 12 months.capital
expendituresthe companys total
capital expenditures were $657 million during 2006, consisting of $200 million
for retail store facilities and equipment related to the companys retail
segment, $263 million for real estate acquisitions for the companys second corporate campus and for a new data center,
and $194 million for corporate infrastructure, including information systems
enhancements. the company currently
anticipates it will utilize approximately $675 million for capital expenditures
during 2007, including approximately $360 million for expansion of the companys
retail segment, approximately $50 million for real estate acquisitions
including the companys second corporate campus and its new data center, and
approximately $265 million to support normal replacement of existing capital
assets and enhancements to general information technology infrastructure.stock repurchase
planin july 1999, the
companys board of directors authorized a plan for the company to repurchase up
to $500 million of its common stock. this repurchase plan does not obligate the
company to acquire any specific number of shares or acquire shares over any
specified period of time. the company has repurchased a total of 13.1 million
shares at a cost of $217 million under this plan and was authorized to
repurchase up to an additional $283 million of its common stock as of september 30,
2006.off-balance sheet
arrangements and contractual obligationsthe company has not entered into any transactions with
unconsolidated entities whereby the company has financial guarantees,
subordinated retained interests, derivative instruments, or other contingent
arrangements that expose the company to material continuing risks, contingent
liabilities, or any other obligation under a variable interest in an
unconsolidated entity that provides financing, liquidity, market risk, or
credit risk support to the company.the

2006, the company had total outstanding commitments on noncancelable operating
leases of approximately $1.2 billion, $887 million of which related to the
lease of retail space and related facilities. lease terms on the companys existing
major facility operating leases range from 5 to 15 years.purchase
commitments with contract manufacturers and component suppliersthe company utilizes several contract manufacturers to
manufacture sub-assemblies for the companys products and to perform final
assembly and test of finished products. these contract manufacturers acquire
components and build product based on demand information supplied by the
company, which typically covers periods ranging from 30 to 150 days. the
company also obtains individual components for its products from a wide variety
of individual suppliers. consistent with industry practice, the company
acquires components through a combination of purchase orders, supplier
contracts, and open orders based on projected demand information. such purchase
commitments typically cover the companys forecasted component and
manufacturing requirements for periods ranging from 30 to 150 days. as of september 30,
2006, the company had outstanding third-party manufacturing commitments and component
purchase commitments of approximately $2.3 billion.during 2006, the company
entered into long-term supply agreements with hynix semiconductor, inc.,
intel corporation, micron technology, inc., samsung electronics co., ltd.,
and toshiba corporation to secure supply of nand flash memory through calendar
year 2010. as part of these agreements, the company prepaid $1.25 billion for
flash memory components during 2006. these prepayments will be applied to
inventory purchases made over the life of each respective agreement.asset retirement
obligationsthe companys asset
retirement obligations are associated with commitments to return property
subject to operating leases to original condition upon lease termination. as of
september 30, 2006, the company estimates that gross expected future cash
flows of approximately $19 million will be required to fulfill these
obligations.other obligationsthe companys other
obligations of approximately $39 million are primarily related to internet and
telecommunications services.indemnificationsthe company generally does not indemnify end-users of
its operating system and application software against legal claims that the
software infringes third-party intellectual property rights. other agreements
entered into by the company sometimes include indemnification provisions under
which the company could be subject to costs and/or damages in the event of an
infringement claim against the company or an indemnified third-party. however,
the company has not been required to make any significant payments resulting
from such an infringement claim asserted against itself or an indemnified
third-party and, in the opinion of management, does not have a liability
related to unresolved infringement claims subject to indemnification that would
have a material adverse effect on its financial condition, liquidity or results
of operations.69

riskin general, the company is a net receiver of foreign
currencies. accordingly, changes in exchange rates, and in particular a
strengthening of the u.s. dollar, may negatively affect the companys net sales
and gross margins as expressed in u.s. dollars. there is also a risk the
company will have to adjust local currency product pricing due to competitive
pressures when there has been significant volatility in foreign currency
exchange rates.the company may enter into foreign currency forward and
option contracts with financial institutions to protect against foreign
exchange risks associated with existing assets and liabilities, certain firmly
committed transactions, forecasted future cash flows, and net investments in
foreign subsidiaries. generally, the companys practice is to hedge a majority
of its existing material foreign exchange transaction exposures. however, the
company may not hedge certain foreign exchange transaction exposures due to
immateriality, prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures, and
limited availability of appropriate hedging instruments.to provide a meaningful assessment of the foreign
currency risk associated with certain of the companys foreign currency
derivative positions, the company performed a sensitivity analysis using a
value-at-risk (var) model to assess the potential impact of fluctuations in
exchange rates. the var model consisted of using a monte carlo simulation to
generate 3,000 random market price paths. the var is the maximum expected loss
in fair value, for a given confidence interval, to the companys foreign
exchange portfolio due to adverse movements in rates. the var model is not
intended to represent actual losses but is used as a risk estimation and
management tool. the model assumes normal market conditions. forecasted
transactions, firm commitments, and assets and liabilities denominated in
foreign currencies were excluded from the model. based on the results of the
model, the company estimates with 95% confidence a maximum one-day loss in fair
value of $9.2 million as of september 30, 2006 compared to a maximum
one-day loss of $10.0 million as of september 24, 2005. because the
company uses foreign currency instruments for hedging purposes, losses incurred
on those instruments are generally offset by increases in the fair value of the
underlying exposures.actual future gains and losses associated with the
companys investment portfolio and derivative positions may differ materially
from the sensitivity analyses performed as of september 30, 2006 due to
the inherent limitations associated with predicting the changes in the timing
and amount of interest rates, foreign currency exchanges rates, and the companys
actual exposures and positions.71

and its wholly-owned subsidiaries (the company) designs, manufactures, and
markets personal computers and related software, services, peripherals, and
networking solutions. the company also designs, develops, and markets a line of
portable digital music players along with related accessories and services
including the online sale of third-party audio and video products. the company
sells its products worldwide through its online stores, its retail stores, its
direct sales force, and third-party wholesalers, resellers, and value-added
resellers. in addition, the company sells a variety of third-party macintosh
and ipod compatible products including application software, printers, storage
devices, speakers, headphones, and various other accessories and supplies
through its online and retail stores. the company sells to education, consumer,
creative professional, business, and government customers.basis of
presentation and preparationthe accompanying consolidated financial statements
include the accounts of the company. intercompany accounts and transactions
have been eliminated. the preparation of these consolidated financial
statements in conformity with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts
reported in these consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes.
actual results could differ materially from those estimates. certain prior year
amounts in the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto have been
reclassified to conform to the current year presentation.typically, the companys
fiscal year ends on the last saturday of september. fiscal years 2005 and 2004 were each 52-week
years. however, approximately every six years, the company reports a 53-week
fiscal year to align its fiscal quarters with calendar quarters by adding a
week to its first fiscal quarter. the company added this additional week in the
first fiscal quarter of its fiscal year 2006. all information presented herein
is based on the companys fiscal calendar.common stock spliton february 28, 2005,
the company effected a two-for-one stock split to shareholders of record as of february 18,
2005. all share and per share information has been retroactively adjusted to
reflect the stock split.financial
instrumentscash equivalents
and short-term investmentsall highly liquid
investments with maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase are
classified as cash equivalents. highly liquid investments with maturities
greater than three months at the date of purchase are classified as short-term
investments. the companys debt and marketable equity securities have been
classified and accounted for as available-for-sale. management
determines the appropriate classification of its investments in debt and
marketable equity securities at the time of purchase and reevaluates the
available-for-sale designations as of each balance sheet date. these securities
are carried at fair value, with the unrealized gains and losses, net of taxes,
reported as a component of shareholders equity. the cost of securities sold is
based upon the specific identification method.derivative
financial instrumentsthe company accounts for its derivative instruments as
either assets or liabilities and carries them at fair value. derivatives that
are not defined as hedges in statement of financial accounting standards (sfas)
no. 133, accounting for derivative instruments and
hedging activities, as amended, must be adjusted to fair value
through earnings. if the derivative is a hedge, depending on the nature of the
hedge,77notes to consolidated financial statements (continued)note 1-summary
of significant accounting policies (continued)changes in fair value will either be offset against
the change in fair value of the hedged assets, liabilities, or firm commitments
through earnings, or recognized in other comprehensive income until the hedged
item is recognized in earnings.for derivative instruments
that hedge the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows that are
designated as cash flow hedges, the effective portion of the gain or loss on
the derivative instrument is reported as a component of accumulated other
comprehensive income in shareholders equity and reclassified into earnings in
the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects
earnings. the ineffective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative
instrument is recognized in current earnings. to receive hedge accounting
treatment, cash flow hedges must be highly effective in offsetting changes to
expected future cash flows on hedged transactions. for derivative instruments
that hedge the exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset or a liability
and that are designated as fair value hedges, the net gain or loss on the
derivative instrument as well as the offsetting gain or loss on the hedged item
attributable to the hedged risk are recognized in earnings in the current
period. the net gain or loss on the effective portion of a derivative
instrument that is designated as an economic hedge of the foreign currency
translation exposure of the net investment in a foreign operation is reported
in the same manner as a foreign currency translation adjustment. for forward contracts
designated as net investment hedges, the company excludes changes in fair value
relating to changes in the forward carry component from its definition of
effectiveness. accordingly, any gains or losses related to this component are
recognized in current earnings.inventoriesinventories are stated at
the lower of cost, computed using the first-in, first-out method, or market. if
the cost of the inventories exceeds their market value, provisions are made
currently for the difference between the cost and the market value. the companys
inventories consist primarily of finished goods for all periods presented.property, plant,
and equipmentproperty, plant, and
equipment are stated at cost. depreciation is computed by use of the straight-line
method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which for buildings is
the lesser of 30 years or the remaining life of the underlying building, up to
5 years for equipment, and the shorter of lease terms or 10 years for leasehold
improvements. the company capitalizes eligible costs to acquire or develop
internal-use software that are incurred subsequent to the preliminary project
stage. capitalized costs related to internal-use software are amortized using
the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which
range from 3 to 5 years. depreciation and amortization expense on property and
equipment was $180 million, $141 million, and $126 million during 2006, 2005,
and 2004, respectively.asset retirement
obligationsthe company records obligations associated with the
retirement of tangible long-lived assets and the associated asset retirement
costs in accordance with sfas no. 143, accounting for asset
retirement obligations. the company reviews legal obligations
associated with the retirement of long-lived assets that result from the
acquisition, construction, development and/or normal use of the assets. if it
is determined that a legal obligation exists, the fair value of the liability
for an asset retirement obligation is recognized in the period in which it is
incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made. the fair value of
the liability is added to the carrying amount of the associated asset and this
additional carrying amount is depreciated over the life of the asset. the
difference between the gross expected future cash flow and its78notes to consolidated financial statements (continued)note 1-summary
of significant accounting policies (continued)present value is accreted over the life of the related
lease as an operating expense. all of the companys existing asset retirement
obligations are associated with commitments to return property subject to
operating leases to original condition upon lease termination.the following table
reconciles changes in the companys asset retirement liabilities for fiscal
2006 and 2005 (in millions):asset retirement
  liability as of september 25, 2004$8.2additional asset retirement obligations recognized2.8accretion recognized0.7asset retirement liability as of september 24,
  2005$11.7additional asset retirement obligations recognized2.5accretion recognized0.5asset retirement
  liability as of september 30, 2006$14.7long-lived
assets including goodwill and other acquired intangible assetsthe company reviews property, plant, and equipment and
certain identifiable intangibles, excluding goodwill, for impairment in
accordance with sfas no. 144, accounting for the
impairment of long-lived assets and for long-lived assets to be disposed of.
long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. recoverability
of these assets is measured by comparison of its carrying amount to future
undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate. if property,
plant, and equipment and certain identifiable intangibles are considered to be
impaired, the impairment to be recognized equals the amount by which the
carrying value of the assets exceeds its fair market value. for the three
fiscal years ended september 30, 2006, the company had no material
impairment of its long-lived assets, except for the impairment of certain
assets in connection with the restructuring actions described in note 6 of
these notes to consolidated financial statements.sfas no. 142, goodwill and other
intangible assets requires that goodwill and intangible assets with
indefinite useful lives should not be amortized but rather be tested for
impairment at least annually or sooner whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate that they may be impaired. the company performs its
goodwill impairment tests on or about august 30 of each year. the company
did not recognize any goodwill or intangible asset impairment charges in 2006,
2005, or 2004. the company established reporting units based on its current
reporting structure. for purposes of testing goodwill for impairment, goodwill
has been allocated to these reporting units to the extent it relates to each
reporting unit.sfas no. 142 also
requires that intangible assets with definite lives be amortized over their
estimated useful lives and reviewed for impairment in accordance with sfas no. 144.
the company is currently amortizing its acquired intangible assets with
definite lives over periods ranging from 3 to 10 years.foreign currency
translationthe company translates the assets and liabilities of
its international non-u.s. functional currency subsidiaries into u.s. dollars
using exchange rates in effect at the end of each period. revenue and expenses
for these subsidiaries are translated using rates that approximate those in
effect during the period. gains and losses from these translations are credited
or charged to foreign currency translation79notes to consolidated financial statements (continued)note 1-summary
of significant accounting policies (continued)included in accumulated
other comprehensive income in shareholders equity. the companys foreign
manufacturing subsidiaries and certain other international subsidiaries that
use the u.s. dollar as their functional currency remeasure monetary assets and
liabilities at exchange rates in effect at the end of each  period, and inventories, property, and
nonmonetary assets and liabilities at historical rates. gains and losses from
these translations were insignificant and have been included in the companys
results of operations.revenue recognitionnet sales consist primarily of revenue from the sale
of hardware, software, peripherals, digital content, and service and support
contracts. the company recognizes revenue pursuant to applicable accounting
standards, including american institute of certified public accountants
statement of position (sop) no. 97-2, software
revenue recognition, as amended, and securities and exchange
commission (sec) staff accounting bulletin (sab) no. 104, revenue recognition.the company recognizes revenue when persuasive
evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the sales price is
fixed or determinable, and collection is probable. product is considered
delivered to the customer once it has been shipped and title and risk of loss
have been transferred. for most of the companys product sales, these criteria
are met at the time the product is shipped. for online sales to individuals,
for some sales to education customers in the u.s., and for certain other sales,
the company defers revenue until the customer receives the product because the
company legally retains a portion of the risk of loss on these sales during
transit. if at the outset of an arrangement the company determines the
arrangement fee is not, or is presumed not to be, fixed or determinable,
revenue is deferred and subsequently recognized as amounts become due and
payable.revenue from service and support contracts is deferred
and recognized ratably over the service coverage periods. these contracts
typically include extended phone support, repair services, web-based support
resources, diagnostic tools, and extend the service coverage offered under the
companys one-year limited warranty.the company sells software and peripheral products
obtained from other companies. the company establishes its own pricing and
retains related inventory risk, is the primary obligor in sales transactions
with its customers, and assumes the credit risk for amounts billed to its
customers. accordingly, the company recognizes revenue for the sale of products
obtained from other companies based on the gross amount billed.revenue on arrangements
that include multiple elements such as hardware, software, and services is
allocated to each element based on the relative fair value of each element.
each elements allocated revenue is recognized when revenue recognition
criteria for that element have been met. fair value is generally determined by
vendor specific objective evidence (vsoe), which is based on the price
charged when each element is sold separately. if the company cannot objectively
determine the fair value of any undelivered element included in a
multiple-element arrangement, the company defers revenue until all elements are
delivered and services have been performed, or until fair value can objectively
be determined for any remaining undelivered elements. when the fair value of a
delivered element has not been established, the company uses the residual method
to recognize revenue if the fair value of all undelivered elements is
determinable. under the residual method, the fair value of the undelivered
elements is deferred and the remaining portion of the arrangement fee is
allocated to the delivered elements and is recognized as revenue.80notes to consolidated financial statements (continued)note 1-summary
of significant accounting policies (continued)the company records reductions to revenue for
estimated commitments related to price protection and for customer incentive
programs, including reseller and end-user rebates, and other sales programs and
volume-based incentives. the estimated cost of these programs is accrued as a
reduction to revenue in the  period the
company has sold the product and committed to a plan. the company also records
reductions to revenue for expected future product returns based on the companys
historical experience.generally, the company
does not offer specified or unspecified upgrade rights to its customers in
connection with software sales or the sale of extended warranty and support
contracts. when the company does offer specified upgrade rights, the company
defers revenue for the fair value of the specified upgrade right until the
future obligation is fulfilled or when the right to the specified upgrade
expires. additionally, a limited number of the companys software products are
available with maintenance agreements that grant customers rights to
unspecified future upgrades over the maintenance term on a when and if
available basis. revenue associated with such maintenance is recognized ratably
over the maintenance term.allowance for
doubtful accountsthe company records its
allowance for doubtful accounts based upon its assessment of various factors. the
company considers historical experience, the age of the accounts receivable
balances, credit quality of the companys customers, current economic
conditions, and other factors that may affect customers ability to pay.shipping costsfor all periods presented,
amounts billed to customers related to shipping and handling are classified as
revenue, and the companys shipping and handling costs are included in cost of
sales.warranty expensethe company provides for
the estimated cost of hardware and software warranties at the time the related
revenue is recognized. the company assesses the adequacy of its preexisting
warranty liabilities and adjusts the amounts as necessary based on actual
experience and changes in future estimates.software
development costsresearch and development costs are expensed as
incurred. development costs of computer software to be sold, leased, or
otherwise marketed are subject to capitalization beginning when a products
technological feasibility has been established and ending when a product is
available for general release to customers pursuant to sfas no. 86, computer software to be sold, leased, or otherwise marketed.
in most instances, the companys products are released soon after technological
feasibility has been established. therefore, costs incurred subsequent to
achievement of technological feasibility are usually not significant, and
generally all software development costs have been immediately expensed.in 2004, the company began
incurring substantial development costs associated with mac os x version 10.4
tiger (tiger) subsequent to achievement of technological feasibility as
evidenced by public demonstration in august 2004 and the subsequent
release of a developer beta version of the product. the company capitalized
approximately $29.7 million and $4.5 million during 2005 and 2004,
respectively, of costs associated with the development of tiger. in accordance
with sfas no. 86, amortization of this asset to cost of sales began in april 2005
when the company began shipping tiger and is being recognized on a
straight-line basis over a three-year estimated useful life.81notes to consolidated financial statements (continued)note 1-summary
of significant accounting policies (continued)during 2004, the company incurred substantial
development costs associated with filemaker pro 7 subsequent to achievement of
technological feasibility as evidenced by public demonstration and release of a
developer beta version, and prior to the release of the final version of the
product in march 2004. therefore, during 2004, the company capitalized
approximately $2.3 million of costs associated with the development of
filemaker pro 7. in accordance with sfas no. 86, amortization of this
asset to cost of sales began in march 2004 when the company began shipping
filemaker pro 7 and is being recognized on a straight-line basis over a
three-year estimated useful life.total amortization related
to capitalized software development costs was $17.8 million, $15.7 million, and
$10.7 million in 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively.advertising costsadvertising costs are
expensed as incurred. advertising expense was $338 million, $287 million, and
$206 million for 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively.stock-based
compensationon september 25, 2005, the company adopted sfas no. 123
(revised 2004) (sfas no. 123r), share-based payment,
which addresses the accounting for stock-based payment transactions in which an
enterprise receives employee services in exchange for (a) equity
instruments of the enterprise or (b) liabilities that are based on the
fair value of the enterprises equity instruments or that may be settled by the
issuance of such equity instruments. in january 2005, the sec issued sab no. 107,
which provides supplemental implementation guidance for sfas no. 123r.
sfas no. 123r eliminates the ability to account for stock-based
compensation transactions using the intrinsic value method under accounting
principles board (apb) opinion no. 25, accounting
for stock issued to employees, and instead generally requires that
such transactions be accounted for using a fair-value-based method. the company
uses the black-scholes-merton (bsm) option-pricing model to determine the
fair-value of stock-based awards under sfas no. 123r, consistent with that
used for pro forma disclosures under sfas no. 123, accounting
for stock-based compensation. the company has elected to use the
modified prospective transition method as permitted by sfas no. 123r and
accordingly prior periods have not been restated to reflect the impact of sfas no. 123r.
the modified prospective transition method requires that stock-based
compensation expense be recorded for all new and unvested stock options,
restricted stock, restricted stock units, and employee stock purchase plan
shares that are ultimately expected to vest as the requisite service is
rendered beginning on september 25, 2005, the first day of the companys
fiscal year 2006. stock-based compensation expense for awards granted prior to september 25,
2005 is based on the grant-date fair-value as determined under the pro forma
provisions of sfas no. 123. the company recognized incremental stock-based
compensation expense of $117 million during 2006 as a result of the adoption of
sfas no. 123r. diluted earnings per common share was reduced by $0.10 for
the year ended september 30, 2006 due to the adoption of sfas
no. 123r. in accordance with sfas no. 123r, beginning in 2006 the
company has presented excess tax benefits from the exercise of stock-based
compensation awards as a financing activity in the consolidated statement of
cash flows.no stock-based
compensation costs have been capitalized as of september 30, 2006. the
income tax benefit related to stock-based compensation expense was $39 million
for the year ended september 30, 2006. as of september 30, 2006,
$375.2 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to stock options
and restricted stock units is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average
period of 2.91 years.82notes to consolidated financial statements (continued)note 1-summary
of significant accounting policies (continued)sfas no. 123r prohibits recognition of a deferred
tax asset for an excess tax benefit that has not been realized. the company
will recognize a benefit from stock-based compensation in equity if an
incremental tax benefit is realized by following the ordering provisions of the
tax law. in addition, the company accounts for the indirect effects of
stock-based compensation on the research tax credit, the foreign tax credit,
and the domestic manufacturing deduction through the income statement.prior to the adoption of sfas no. 123r, the
company measured compensation expense for its employee stock-based compensation
plans using the intrinsic value method prescribed by apb opinion no. 25.
the company applied the disclosure provisions of sfas no. 123 as amended
by sfas no. 148, accounting for stock-based
compensation-transition and disclosure, as if the fair-value-based
method had been applied in measuring compensation expense. under apb opinion no. 25,
when the exercise price of the companys employee stock options was equal to
the market price of the underlying stock on the date of the grant, no
compensation expense was recognized.the following table
illustrates the effect on net income after taxes and net income per common
share as if the company had applied the fair value recognition provisions of
sfas no. 123 to stock-based compensation during 2005 and 2004 (in

regarding stock-based compensation can be found in note 9.earnings per common
sharebasic earnings per common share is computed by
dividing income available to common shareholders by the weighted-average number
of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. diluted earnings per
common share is computed by dividing income available to common shareholders by
the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the
period increased to include the number of additional shares of common stock
that would have been outstanding if the dilutive potential shares of common
stock had been issued. the dilutive effect of outstanding options, restricted
stock, and restricted stock units is reflected in diluted earnings per share by
application of the treasury stock method. under the83notes to consolidated financial statements (continued)note 1-summary
of significant accounting policies (continued)treasury stock method, an increase in the fair market
value of the companys common stock can result in a greater dilutive effect
from outstanding options, restricted stock, and restricted stock units. additionally,
the exercise of employee stock options and the vesting of restricted stock and
restricted stock units can result in a greater dilutive effect on earnings per
share.the following table sets

comprehensive income refers to revenue, expenses, gains, and losses that under
generally accepted accounting principles are recorded as an element of
shareholders equity but are excluded from net income. the companys other
comprehensive income is comprised of foreign currency translation adjustments
from those subsidiaries not using the u.s. dollar as their functional currency,
unrealized gains and losses on marketable securities categorized as
available-for-sale, and net deferred gains and losses on certain derivative instruments
accounted for as cash flow hedges.segment informationthe company reports segment information based on the
management approach. the management approach designates the internal
reporting used by management for making decisions and assessing performance as
the source of the companys reportable segments. information about the
companys products, major customers, and geographic areas on a company-wide
basis is also disclosed.84

consolidated financial statementsthe company is restating its consolidated balance
sheet as of september 24, 2005, and the related consolidated statements of
operations, shareholders equity, and cash flows for each of the fiscal years
ended september 24, 2005 and september 25, 2004, and each of the
quarters in fiscal year 2005.previously filed annual reports on form 10-k
and quarterly reports on form 10-q affected by the restatements have
not been amended and should not be relied on.on june 29, 2006, the company announced that an
internal review had discovered irregularities related to the issuance of
certain stock option grants made between 1997 and 2001, including a grant to
its chief executive officer (ceo) steve jobs. the company also announced that
a special committee of outside directors (special committee) had been formed
and had hired independent counsel to conduct a full investigation of the
companys past stock option granting practices.as a result of the internal review and the independent
investigation, management has concluded, and the audit and finance committee of
the board of directors agrees, that incorrect measurement dates were used for
financial accounting purposes for certain stock option grants made in prior
periods. therefore, the company has recorded additional non-cash stock-based
compensation expense and related tax effects with regard to past stock option
grants, and the company is restating previously filed financial statements in
this form 10-k. these adjustments, after tax, amounted to $4
million, $7 million, and $10 million in fiscal years 2006, 2005 and 2004,
respectively. the adjustment to 2006 was recorded in the fourth quarter of
fiscal year 2006 due to its insignificance.the independent counsel and its forensic accountants (investigative
team) reviewed the facts and circumstances surrounding stock option grants
made on 259 dates. based on a review of the totality of evidence and the
applicable law, the special committee found no misconduct by current
management. the special committees investigation identified a number of grants
for which grant dates were intentionally selected in order to obtain favorable
exercise prices. the terms of these and certain other grants, as discussed
below, were finalized after the originally assigned grant dates. the special
committee concluded that the procedures for granting, accounting for, and
reporting stock option grants did not include sufficient safeguards to prevent
manipulation. although the investigation found that ceo steve jobs was aware or
recommended the selection of some favorable grant dates, he did not receive or financially
benefit from these grants or appreciate the accounting implications. the
special committee also found that the investigation had raised serious concerns
regarding the actions of two former officers in connection with the accounting,
recording and reporting of stock option grants.based on the evidence and findings from the companys
internal review and the special committees independent investigation, an
analysis was performed of the measurement dates for the 42,077 stock option
grants made on 259 dates between october 1996 and january 2003 (the relevant
period). the company believes that the analysis was properly limited to the
relevant period. in addition to analyzing all grants made during the relevant
period, the company sampled certain grants between 1994 and 1997 and found none
that required accounting adjustments. the first grants for which stock-based
compensation expense is required are dated december 29, 1997. the company
also examined grants made after the relevant period and found none that
required accounting adjustments. moreover, in the years after 2002, apple made
significant changes in its stock option granting practices in response to
evolving legal, regulatory and accounting requirements.consistent with the accounting literature and recent
guidance from the securities and exchange commission (sec), the grants during
the relevant period were organized into categories based on grant85notes to consolidated financial statements (continued)note 2-restatement
of consolidated financial statements (continued)type and process by which the grant was finalized. the
company analyzed the evidence related to each category of grants including, but
not limited to, electronic and physical documents, document metadata, and
witness interviews. based on the relevant facts and circumstances, the company
applied the controlling accounting standards to determine, for every grant
within each category, the proper measurement date. if the measurement date is
not the originally assigned grant date, accounting adjustments were made as
required, resulting in stock-based compensation expense and related tax
effects.the 42,077 grants were classified as follows: (1) 17
grants to persons elected or appointed to the board of directors (director
grants); (2) 3,892 grants to employees under the monday/tuesday plan
described below (monday/tuesday grants); (3) 27,096 grants made in
broad-based awards to large numbers of employees, usually on an annual basis (focal
grants); (4) 9,988 other grants ratified at meetings of the board or
compensation committee (meeting grants); (5) 1,082 other grants ratified
by unanimous written consent (uwc) of the board or compensation committee (other
uwc grants); and (6) two grants to the ceo (ceo grants). all references
to the number of option shares, option exercise prices, and share prices in
this note 2 have not been adjusted for any subsequent stock splits.with the exception of director grants, all stock
option grants were subject to ratification by the board or compensation
committee at a meeting or by uwc. following approval of the grants at a meeting
or by uwc, the companys legal staff would prepare a secretarys certificate
certifying the ratification of the grants. based on the facts and circumstances
described below, the company has concluded that the recipients and terms of
certain grants were fixed for accounting purposes before ratification pursuant
to parameters previously approved by the board or compensation committee
through the monday/tuesday plan and the focal process. as further discussed
below, within these parameters, management had the authority to determine the
recipients and terms for each grant. thus, the company has concluded that the
measurement dates for these grants occurred when managements process for
allocating these grants was completed and the grants were ready for
ratification, which was considered perfunctory. with regard to all other
grants, the company has concluded that the grants were finalized and the
measurement dates occurred when the grants were ratified. for many grants,
however, the dates of ratification cannot be established because the dates the uwcs
were executed by the board or compensation committee members or received by the
company are not available. for such grants, the company has concluded that the
date of the preparation of the secretarys certificate is the best alternative
for determining the actual date of ratification.as discussed below, the companys analysis determined
that the originally assigned grant dates for 6,428 grants on 42 dates are not
the proper measurement dates. accordingly, after accounting for forfeitures,
the company has recognized stock-based compensation expense of $105 million on
a pre-tax basis over the respective awards vesting terms. no adjustments were
required for the remaining 35,649 grants. the adjustments were determined by
category as follows:director grants-seventeen director grants were made
during the relevant period. two director grants were made pursuant to a 1997
plan that dated the grants on the enactment of the plan. the remaining fifteen
grants were automatically made under the director stock option plan for
non-employee directors, which was approved by shareholders in 1998, on the date
of a directors election or appointment to the board and on subsequent
anniversaries, beginning on the fourth anniversary. accordingly, the analysis
determined that the originally assigned grant date for each director grant is
the measurement date, and no accounting adjustments are required.86notes to consolidated financial statements (continued)note 2-restatement
of consolidated financial statements (continued)monday/tuesday grants-beginning in december 1998,
3,892 new hire grants and grants for promotion and retention purposes (promotion/retention
grants) were made during the relevant period under the monday/tuesday plan. under
the monday/tuesday plan, new hire grants made within pre-established guidelines
approved by the board or compensation committee were dated on the monday that
the recipient started work (or the following monday, if the recipient started
on another day). the companys analysis showed this process to be reliable with
very low error rates. promotion/retention grants, also based on pre-established
guidelines, were made generally on the first tuesday of each month. the company
has concluded that the new hire and promotion/retention grants made pursuant to
the monday/tuesday plan within pre-established guidelines do not require
adjustment, with the exception of six grants that were erroneously dated before
the employees start dates. for 120 new hire and promotion/retention grants
made outside the guidelines, however, the company has concluded that the
measurement dates are the dates of ratification by the board or compensation
committee rather than the dates used for grants within guidelines. accordingly,
based on the methodology described above, the company has recognized
stock-based compensation expense of $6 million from 126 grants.focal grants-during the relevant period, 27,096 focal
grants were made to employees typically on an annual basis as part of an
extensive process that required several months to complete. pursuant to limits,
guidelines and practices previously approved by the board or compensation committee,
managers throughout the company would make recommendations for grants to
employees in their areas of responsibility. after senior management had
determined that the grants were made in accordance with these established
limits, guidelines and practices, management treated the grants as final when
they were submitted to the board or compensation committee for ratification. the
company has concluded that for 5,595 grants on five dates, the originally
assigned grant dates are not the proper measurement dates. for these grants,
managements process for finalizing the grants was completed after the originally
assigned grant dates. as a result, the company has recognized $29 million of
stock-based compensation expense. for two of the five grant dates comprising
3,744 grants, the evidence shows that the grants were finalized and the
measurement date occurred one day after the originally assigned grant dates. the
grants on these two dates represent more than $16 million of the total $29
million of stock-based compensation expense resulting from focal grants.other meeting grants-during the relevant period,
meetings of the board or compensation committee were held to ratify 9,988
grants that are not monday/tuesday, focal or ceo grants. the grant dates and
measurement dates for these grants are the meeting dates when the grants were
ratified, with the exception of 46 grants. forty-two of these 46 grants are
dated concurrent with a meeting that considered and approved certain grants,
but the evidence indicates that all of the grants may not have been finalized
until a later date. one of the 46 grants was approved and dated at another
meeting, but the recipient, who was becoming employed by the company as part of
a corporate acquisition, did not start until a later date. two other grants
were approved before the employees start dates. another grant was mistakenly
cancelled and subsequently reinstated, requiring an accounting adjustment.
thus, for these 46 grants the company has concluded that the originally assigned
grant dates are not the proper measurement dates. as a result, the company has
recognized $2 million of stock-based compensation expense.other uwc grants-during the relevant period, 1,082
grants were approved by uwcs for a variety of purposes, including executive
recruitment, retention, promotion and new hires outside the monday/tuesday
process. these grants were not made pursuant to pre-established guidelines
adopted by the board or compensation committee. therefore, the company has
concluded that these grants were87notes to consolidated financial statements (continued)note 2-restatement
of consolidated financial statements (continued)not finalized for accounting purposes until
ratification by the board or compensation committee. accordingly, for 660
grants, the company has concluded that the originally assigned grant dates are
not the proper measurement dates. as a result, the company has recognized $48
million of stock-based compensation expense.ceo grants-during the relevant period, the company
made two grants to ceo steve jobs. the first grant, dated january 12,
2000, was for 10 million option shares. the second grant, dated october 19,
2001, was for 7.5 million option shares. both grants were cancelled in march 2003
prior to being exercised, when mr. jobs received 5 million shares of
restricted stock.with respect to the grant dated january 12, 2000,
the board on december 2, 1999, authorized a special ceo compensation
committee to grant mr. jobs up to 15 million shares. the evidence
indicates that the ceo compensation committee finalized the terms of the grant
on january 12, 2000, although the committees action was memorialized in a
uwc transmitted on january 18, 2000. because the measurement date is the originally
assigned grant date, the company has not recognized any stock-based
compensation expense from this grant. if the company had determined that the
measurement date was the date when the uwc was executed or received, then
additional stock-based compensation would have been recognized.the grant dated october 19, 2001 was originally
approved at a board meeting on august 29, 2001, with an exercise price of
$17.83. the terms of the grant, however, were not finalized until december 18,
2001. the grant was dated october 19, 2001, with an exercise price of
$18.30. the approval for the grant was improperly recorded as occurring at a
special board meeting on october 19, 2001. such a special board meeting
did not occur. there was no evidence, however, that any current member of
management was aware of this irregularity. the company has recognized $20
million in stock-based compensation expense for this grant, reflecting the
difference between the exercise price of $18.30 and the share price on december 18,
2001 of $21.01.the incremental impact

investigation of past stock option grants is as follows (dollars in millions):fiscal yearpre-tax

result of such sales. these net gains were included in interest and other

the companys investments during 2006 in u.s. government securities and during
2005 in u.s. government securities, u.s. corporate securities, and foreign
securities were caused primarily by changes in interest rates. the company
typically invests in highly-rated securities with low probabilities of default.
the companys investment policy requires investments to be rated single-a or
better. therefore, the company considers the declines to be temporary in nature.
as of september 30, 2006, the company does not consider the investments to
be other-than-temporarily impaired.market values were
determined for each individual security in the investment portfolio. when
evaluating the investments for other-than-temporary impairment, the company
reviews factors such as the length of time and extent to which fair value has
been below cost basis, the financial condition of the issuer, and the companys
ability and intent to hold the investment for a period of time, which may be
sufficient for anticipated recovery in market value.92notes to consolidated financial statements (continued)note 3-financial
instruments (continued)accounts receivabletrade receivablesthe company distributes its products through
third-party distributors and resellers and directly to certain education,
consumer, and commercial customers. the company generally does not require
collateral from its customers; however, the company will require collateral in
certain instances to limit credit risk. in addition, when possible, the company
does attempt to limit credit risk on trade receivables with credit insurance
for certain customers in latin america, europe, asia, and australia and by
arranging with third-party financing companies to provide flooring arrangements
and other loan and lease programs to the companys direct customers. these
credit-financing arrangements are directly between the third-party financing
company and the end customer. as such, the company generally does not assume
any recourse or credit risk sharing related to any of these arrangements.
however, considerable trade receivables that are not covered by collateral,
third-party flooring arrangements, or credit insurance are outstanding with the
companys distribution and retail channel partners. no customer accounted for
more than 10% of trade receivables as of september 30, 2006 or september 24,

receivablesthe company has non-trade
receivables from certain of its manufacturing vendors resulting from the sale
of raw material components to these manufacturing vendors who manufacture
sub-assemblies or assemble final products for the company. the company
purchases these raw material components directly from suppliers. these
non-trade receivables, which are included in the consolidated balance sheets in
other current assets, totaled $1.6 billion and $417 million as of september 30,
2006 and september 24, 2005, respectively. the company does not reflect
the sale of these components in net sales and does not recognize any profits on
these sales until the products are sold through to the end customer at which
time the profit is recognized as a reduction of cost of sales.derivative
financial instrumentsthe company uses derivatives to partially offset its
business exposure to foreign exchange risk. foreign currency forward and option
contracts are used to offset the foreign exchange risk on certain existing
assets and liabilities and to hedge the foreign exchange risk on expected
future cash flows on certain forecasted revenue and cost of sales. from time to
time, the company enters into interest rate derivative agreements to modify the
interest rate profile of certain investments and debt. the companys accounting
policies for these instruments are based on whether the instruments are
designated as hedge or non-hedge instruments. the company records all
derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value.93notes to consolidated financial statements (continued)note 3-financial

instruments provide one measure of the transaction volume outstanding as of

or market loss. the credit risk amounts shown in the table above represents the
companys gross exposure to potential accounting loss on these transactions if
all counterparties failed to perform according to the terms of the contract,
based on then-current currency exchange rates at each respective date.
the companys exposure to credit loss and market risk will vary over time as a
function of currency exchange rates.the estimates of fair
value are based on applicable and commonly used pricing models and prevailing
financial market information as of september 30, 2006 and september 24,
2005. although the table above reflects the notional principal, fair value, and
credit risk amounts of the companys foreign exchange instruments, it does not
reflect the gains or losses associated with the exposures and transactions that
the foreign exchange instruments are intended to hedge. the amounts ultimately
realized upon settlement of these financial instruments, together with the
gains and losses on the underlying exposures, will depend on actual market
conditions during the remaining life of the instruments.foreign exchange
risk managementthe company may enter into foreign currency forward
and option contracts with financial institutions to protect against foreign
exchange risk associated with existing assets and liabilities, certain firmly
committed transactions, forecasted future cash flows, and net investments in
foreign subsidiaries. generally, the companys practice is to hedge a majority
of its existing material foreign exchange transaction exposures. however, the
company may not hedge certain foreign exchange transaction exposures due to
immateriality, prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures, or
limited availability of appropriate hedging instruments.to help protect gross margins from fluctuations in
foreign currency exchange rates, the companys u.s. dollar functional
subsidiaries hedge a portion of forecasted foreign currency revenue, and the
companys non-u.s. dollar functional subsidiaries selling in local currencies
hedge a portion of forecasted inventory purchases not denominated in the
subsidiaries functional currency. other comprehensive income94notes to consolidated financial statements (continued)note 3-financial
instruments (continued)associated with hedges of foreign currency revenue is
recognized as a component of net sales in the same period as the related sales
are recognized, and other comprehensive income related to inventory purchases
is recognized as a component of cost of sales in the same period as the related
costs are recognized. typically, the company hedges portions of its forecasted
foreign currency exposure associated with revenue and inventory purchases over
a time horizon of up to 6 months.derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges
must be de-designated as hedges when it is probable that the forecasted hedged
transaction will not occur in the initially identified time period or within a
subsequent 2 month time period. deferred gains and losses in other
comprehensive income associated with such derivative instruments are
immediately reclassified into earnings in other income and expense. any
subsequent changes in fair value of such derivative instruments are also
reflected in current earnings unless they are re-designated as hedges of other
transactions. the company recognized a net gain of approximately $421,000 in
2006 and net losses of $1.6 million and $2.8 million in 2005 and 2004,
respectively, in other income and expense related to the loss of hedge
designation on discontinued cash flow hedges due to changes in the companys
forecast of future net sales and cost of sales and due to prevailing market
conditions. as of september 30, 2006, the company had a net deferred gain
associated with cash flow hedges of approximately $2.8 million, net of taxes,
substantially all of which is expected to be reclassified to earnings by the
end of the second quarter of fiscal 2007.the net gain or loss on the effective portion of a
derivative instrument designated as a net investment hedge is included in the
cumulative translation adjustment account of accumulated other comprehensive
income within shareholders equity. for the years ended september 30, 2006
and september 24, 2005, the company had net gains of $7.4 million and
$673,000, respectively, included in the cumulative translation adjustment.the company may also enter
into foreign currency forward and option contracts to offset the foreign
exchange gains and losses generated by the re-measurement of certain assets and
liabilities recorded in non-functional currencies. changes in the fair value of
these derivatives are recognized in current earnings in other income and
expense as offsets to the changes in the fair value of the related assets or
liabilities. due to currency market movements, changes in option time value can
lead to increased volatility in other income and expense.note 4-consolidated

years and 5.5 years, respectively.during 2006, the company sold certain assets related
to its powerschool web-based student information system operations. in
connection with this sale, the company reduced goodwill by $31 million for the
outstanding balance from the acquisition of powerschool, inc. in 2001 and
recognized a $4 million pre-tax gain, which is reflected in other income and
expense in the consolidated statement of operations.during 2005, the company recorded an adjustment of
approximately $11 million to goodwill relating to a reduction of valuation
allowances that were recorded at the time certain net operating loss
carryforwards (nols) were acquired in previous business combinations. during
2005, these nols were deemed to be more likely than not to be realized and
accordingly the valuation allowances were reversed against the related goodwill
that was recognized at the time of the acquisitions.97

note 2, restatement of consolidated financial statements.the foreign provision for income taxes is based on
foreign pretax earnings of approximately $1.5 billion, $922 million, and $384
million in 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively. as of september 30, 2006,98notes to consolidated financial statements (continued)note 7-income
taxes (continued)approximately $4.1 billion of the companys cash, cash
equivalents, and short-term investments were held by foreign subsidiaries
and are generally based in u.s. dollar-denominated holdings. amounts held
by foreign subsidiaries are generally subject to u.s. income taxation on
repatriation to the u.s. the companys consolidated financial statements
provide for any related tax liability on amounts that may be repatriated, aside
from undistributed earnings of certain of the companys foreign subsidiaries
that are intended to be indefinitely reinvested in operations outside the u.s.
u.s. income taxes have not been provided on a cumulative total of $823 million
of such earnings. it is not practicable to determine the income tax liability
that might be incurred if these earnings were to be distributed.on october 22, 2004, the american jobs creation
act of 2004 (ajca) was signed into law. the ajca included a provision for the
deduction of 85% of certain foreign earnings that were repatriated, as defined
in the ajca, within a specified time frame. among other requirements, dividends
qualifying for the 85% deduction must be reinvested in the united states in
certain qualified investments pursuant to a domestic reinvestment plan approved
by the chief executive officer (ceo) and board of directors. during 2006, the
company repatriated approximately $1.6 billion of foreign earnings. of the
earnings repatriated, $755 million is eligible for the reduced tax rate
provided by the ajca. accordingly, the company recorded a tax charge of $51
million related to the repatriation of foreign earnings under the provisions of
the ajca. in addition, the company recorded a tax benefit of $71 million
resulting from the implementation of tax planning strategies to recognize
deferred tax assets that were previously not recognizable within certain
foreign subsidiaries.deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect the
effects of tax losses, credits, and the future income tax effects of temporary
differences between the consolidated financial statement carrying amounts of
existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and are measured
using enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in the years in which
those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.as of september 30,

2005, a valuation allowance of $5 million was recorded against the deferred tax
asset for the benefits of state operating losses that may not be realized. management
believes it is more likely than not that forecasted income, including income
that may be generated as a result of certain tax planning strategies, together
with the tax effects of the deferred tax liabilities, will be sufficient to
fully recover the remaining deferred tax assets.a
reconciliation of the provision for income taxes, with the amount computed by
applying the statutory federal income tax rate (35% in 2006, 2005, and 2004) to
income before provision for income taxes, is as follows (in millions):200620052004as restated (1)as restated (1)computed expected

note 2, restatement of consolidated financial statements.the companys income taxes
payable has been reduced by the tax benefits from employee stock options. the
company receives an income tax benefit calculated as the difference between the
fair market value of the stock issued at the time of the exercise and the
option price, tax effected. the net tax benefits from employee stock option
transactions were $419 million, $428 million (as restated(1)), and $83 million
(as restated(1)) in 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively, and were reflected as
an increase to common stock in the consolidated statements of shareholders
equity.100notes to consolidated financial statements (continued)note 7-income
taxes (continued)the internal revenue
service (irs) has substantially completed its field audit of the companys
federal income tax returns for the years 2002 through 2003 and proposed certain
adjustments. the company intends to contest certain of these adjustments
through the irs appeals office. substantially all irs audit issues for years
prior to 2002 have been resolved. in addition, the company is also subject to
audits by state, local, and foreign tax authorities. management believes that
adequate provisions have been made for any adjustments that may result from tax
examinations. however, the outcome of tax audits cannot be predicted with
certainty. should any issues addressed in the companys tax audits be resolved
in a manner not consistent with managements expectations, the company could be
required to adjust its provision for income tax in the period such resolution
occurs. in 2006, the company recorded a tax benefit of $20 million due to
the settlement of prior year tax audits in the u.s.note 8-shareholders
equitypreferred stockthe company has five
million shares of authorized preferred stock, none of which is outstanding.
under the terms of the companys restated articles of incorporation, the board
of directors is authorized to determine or alter the rights, preferences,
privileges, and restrictions of the companys authorized but unissued shares of
preferred stock.restricted stock unitsthe companys board of directors has granted
restricted stock units to members of the companys senior management team,
excluding its ceo. these restricted stock units generally vest over four years
either at the end of the four-year service period, in two equal installments on
the second and fourth anniversaries of the date of grant, or in equal
installments on each of the first through fourth anniversaries of the grant
date. upon vesting, the restricted stock units will convert into an equivalent
number of shares of common stock. the amounts of the restricted stock units
expensed by the company are based on the closing market price of the companys
common stock on the date of grant and are amortized on a straight-line basis
over the four-year requisite service period. the restricted stock units have
been reflected in the calculation of diluted earnings per share utilizing the
treasury stock method.2.47 million previously
granted restricted stock units vested during 2006. a majority of these vested
restricted stock units were net-share settled such that the company withheld
shares with value equivalent to the employees minimum statutory obligation for
the applicable income and other employment taxes, and remitted the cash to the
appropriate taxing authorities. the total shares withheld of 985,833 for 2006
was based on the value of the restricted stock units on their vesting date as
determined by the companys closing stock price. total payments for the
employees tax obligations to the taxing authorities were approximately $59 million.
these net-share settlements had the effect of share repurchases by the company
as they reduced and retired the number of shares that would have otherwise been
issued as a result of the vesting and did not represent an expense to the
company.ceo restricted stock awardon march 19, 2003,
the companys board of directors granted 10 million shares of restricted stock
to the companys ceo that vested on march 19, 2006. the amount of the
restricted stock award expensed by the company was based on the closing market
price of the companys common stock on the date of grant and was amortized on a
straight-line basis over the three-year requisite service period.101notes to consolidated financial statements (continued)note 8-shareholders
equity (continued)upon vesting during 2006,
the restricted stock award was net-share settled such that the company withheld
shares with value equivalent to the ceos minimum statutory obligation for the
applicable income and other employment taxes, and remitted the cash to the
appropriate taxing authorities. the total shares withheld of 4.6 million was
based on the value of the restricted stock award on the vesting date as
determined by the companys closing stock price of $64.66. the remaining shares
net of those withheld were delivered to the companys ceo. total payments for
the ceos tax obligations to the taxing authorities were approximately $296
million. the net-share settlement had the effect of share repurchases by the
company as it reduced and retired the number of shares outstanding and did not
represent an expense to the company.stock repurchase planin july 1999, the
companys board of directors authorized a plan for the company to repurchase up
to $500 million of its common stock. this repurchase plan does not obligate the
company to acquire any specific number of shares or acquire shares over any
specified period of time. the company has repurchased a total of 13.1 million
shares at a cost of $217 million under this plan and was authorized to
repurchase up to an additional $283 million of its common stock as of september 30,
2006.comprehensive incomecomprehensive income consists of two components: net
income and other comprehensive income. other comprehensive income refers to
revenue, expenses, gains, and losses that under u.s. generally accepted
accounting principles are recorded as an element of shareholders equity but
are excluded from net income. the companys other comprehensive income consists
of foreign currency translation adjustments from those subsidiaries not using
the u.s. dollar as their functional currency, unrealized gains and losses on
marketable securities categorized as available-for-sale, and net deferred gains
and losses on certain derivative instruments accounted for as cash flow hedges.the

plan (the 2003 plan) is a shareholder approved plan that provides for
broad-based grants to employees, including executive officers. based on the
terms of individual option grants, options granted under the 2003 plan
generally expire 7 to 10 years after the grant date and generally become
exercisable over a period of 4 years, based on continued employment, with
either annual or quarterly vesting. the 2003 plan permits the granting of
incentive stock options, nonstatutory stock options, restricted stock units,
stock appreciation rights, and stock purchase rights.1997 employee stock option planin august 1997, the
companys board of directors approved the 1997 employee stock option plan (the 1997
plan), a non-shareholder approved plan for grants of stock options to employees
who are not officers of the company. based on the terms of individual option
grants, options granted under the 1997 plan generally expire 7 to 10 years
after the grant date and generally become exercisable over a period of 4 years,
based on continued employment, with either annual or quarterly vesting. in october 2003,
the company terminated the 1997 employee stock option plan and cancelled all
remaining unissued shares totaling 28,590,702. no new options can be granted
from the 1997 plan.employee stock option exchange programon march 20, 2003,
the company announced a voluntary employee stock option exchange program (the exchange
program) whereby eligible employees, other than executive officers and members
of the board of directors, had an opportunity to exchange outstanding options
with exercise prices at or above $12.50 per share for a predetermined smaller
number of new stock options issued with exercise prices equal to the fair
market value of one share of the companys common stock on the day the new
awards were issued, which was to be at least six months plus one day after the
exchange options were cancelled. on april 17, 2003, in accordance with the
exchange program, the company cancelled options to purchase 33,138,386 shares
of its common stock. on october 22, 2003, new stock options totaling
13,394,736 shares were issued to employees at an exercise price of $11.38 per
share, which is equivalent to the closing price of the companys stock on that
date. no financial or accounting impact to the companys financial position,
results of operations or cash flows was associated with this transaction.103notes to consolidated financial statements (continued)note 8-shareholders equity (continued)1997 director stock option planin august 1997, the
companys board of directors adopted a director stock option plan (director
plan) for non-employee directors of the company, which was approved by
shareholders in 1998. pursuant to the
director plan, the companys non-employee directors are granted an option to
acquire 30,000 shares of common stock upon their initial election to the board
(initial options). the initial options vest and
become exercisable in three equal annual installments on each of the first
through third anniversaries of the grant date. on the fourth anniversary of a
non-employee directors initial election to the board and on each subsequent
anniversary thereafter, the director will be entitled to receive an option to
acquire 10,000 shares of common stock (annual options). annual options are
fully vested and immediately exercisable on their date of grant.rule 10b5-1 trading planscertain of the companys
executive officers, including mr. timothy d. cook, mr. peter
oppenheimer, mr. philip w. schiller, and dr. bertrand serlet, have
entered into trading plans pursuant to rule 10b5-1(c)(1) of the
securities exchange act of 1934, as amended. a trading plan is a written
document that pre-establishes the amounts, prices and dates (or formula for
determining the amounts, prices and dates) of future purchases or sales of the
companys stock including the exercise and sale of employee stock options and
shares acquired pursuant to the companys employee stock purchase plan and upon
vesting of restricted stock units.employee stock purchase planthe company has a
shareholder approved employee stock purchase plan (the purchase plan), under
which substantially all employees may purchase common stock through payroll
deductions at a price equal to 85% of the lower of the fair market values as of
the beginning and end of six month offering periods. stock purchases under the
purchase plan are limited to 10% of an employees compensation, up to a maximum
of $25,000 in any calendar year. the number of shares authorized for issuance
is limited to a total of 1 million shares per offering period. during 2006,
2005, and 2004, adjusted for the february 2005 stock split, 1.5 million,
2.3 million, and 3.9 million shares, respectively, were issued under the
purchase plan. as of september 30, 2006, approximately 2.3 million shares
were reserved for future issuance under the purchase plan.employee savings planthe company has an employee savings plan (the savings
plan) qualifying as a deferred salary arrangement under
section 401(k) of the internal revenue code. under the savings plan,
participating u.s. employees may defer a portion of their pre-tax earnings, up
to the internal revenue service annual contribution limit ($15,000 for calendar
year 2006). the company matches 50% to 100% of each employees contributions,
depending on length of service, up to a maximum 6% of the employees earnings.
the companys matching contributions to the savings plan were approximately $33
million, $28 million, and $24 million in 2006, 2005, and 2004,
respectively.104

commensurate with the estimated expected life of the companys stock options
and other relevant factors including implied volatility in market traded
options on the companys common stock. the company bases its expected life

and indemnificationsthe company offers a basic limited parts and labor
warranty on its hardware products. the basic warranty period for hardware
products is typically one year from the date of purchase by the end-user. the
company also offers a 90-day basic warranty for its service parts used to
repair the companys hardware products. the company provides currently for the
estimated cost that may be incurred under its basic limited product warranties
at the time related revenue is recognized. factors considered in determining
appropriate accruals for product warranty obligations include the size of the
installed base of products subject to warranty protection, historical and
projected warranty claim rates, historical and projected cost-per-claim, and
knowledge of specific product failures that are outside of the companys
typical experience. the company assesses the adequacy of its preexisting
warranty liabilities and adjusts the amounts as necessary based on actual
experience and changes in future estimates.the company periodically provides updates to its
applications and system software to maintain the softwares compliance with
specifications. the estimated cost to develop such updates is accounted for as
warranty costs that are recognized at the time related software revenue is
recognized. factors considered in determining appropriate accruals related to
such updates include the number of units delivered, the number of updates
expected to occur, and the historical cost and estimated future cost of the
resources necessary to develop these updates.the

and contingencies (continued)the
company generally does not indemnify end-users of its operating system and
application software against legal claims that the software infringes
third-party intellectual property rights. other agreements entered into by the
company sometimes include indemnification provisions under which the company
could be subject to costs and/or damages in the event of an infringement claim
against the company or an indemnified third-party. however, the company has not
been required to make any significant payments resulting from such an
infringement claim asserted against itself or an indemnified third-party and,
in the opinion of management, does not have a potential liability related to
unresolved infringement claims subject to indemnification that would have a
material adverse effect on its financial condition, liquidity or results of
operations. therefore, the company did not record a liability for infringement
costs as of either september 30, 2006 or september 24, 2005.concentrations in
the available sources of supply of materials and productalthough most components
essential to the companys business are generally available from multiple
sources, other key components (including microprocessors and application-specific
integrated circuits (asics)) are currently obtained by the company from
single or limited sources. some other key components, while currently available
to the company from multiple sources, are at times subject to industry-wide
availability and pricing pressures. in addition, the company uses some
components that are not common to the rest of the personal computer industry,
and new products introduced by the company often initially utilize custom
components obtained from only one source until the company has evaluated
whether there is a need for and subsequently qualifies additional suppliers. if
the supply of a key single-sourced component to the company were to be
delayed or curtailed, or in the event a key manufacturing vendor delays
shipments of completed products to the company, the companys ability to ship
related products in desired quantities and in a timely manner could be adversely
affected. the companys business and financial performance could also be
adversely affected depending on the time required to obtain sufficient
quantities from the original source, or to identify and obtain sufficient
quantities from an alternative source. continued availability of these
components may be affected if producers were to decide to concentrate on the
production of common components instead of components customized to meet the
companys requirements. finally, significant portions of the companys cpus,
logic boards, and assembled products are now manufactured by outsourcing
partners, primarily in various parts of asia. although the company works
closely with its outsourcing partners on manufacturing schedules, the companys
operating results could be adversely affected if its outsourcing partners were
unable to meet their production obligations.long-term supply
agreementsduring 2006, the company
entered into long-term supply agreements with hynix semiconductor, inc.,
intel corporation, micron technology, inc., samsung electronics co., ltd.,
and toshiba corporation to secure supply of nand flash memory through calendar
year 2010. as part of these agreements, the company prepaid $1.25 billion for
flash memory components during 2006. these prepayments will be applied to
inventory purchases made over the life of each respective agreement.contingenciesthe company is subject to certain other legal
proceedings and claims that have arisen in the ordinary course of business and
have not been fully adjudicated. in the opinion of management, the company does
not have a potential liability related to any current legal proceedings and
claims that would individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse
effect on its financial condition, liquidity, or results of operations.108notes to consolidated financial statements (continued)note 10-commitments
and contingencies (continued)however, the results of legal proceedings cannot be
predicted with certainty. should the company fail to prevail in any of these
legal matters or should several of these legal matters be resolved against the
company in the same reporting period, the operating results of a particular
reporting period could be materially adversely affected.production and marketing
of products in certain states and countries may subject the company to
environmental and other regulations including, in some instances, the
requirement to provide customers the ability to return product at the end of
its useful life, and place responsibility for environmentally safe disposal or
recycling with the company. such laws and regulations have recently been passed
in several jurisdictions in which the company operates including various
european union member countries, japan and certain states within the u.s. although
the company does not anticipate any material adverse effects in the future
based on the nature of its operations and the thrust of such laws, there is no
assurance that such existing laws or future laws will not have a material
adverse effect on the companys financial condition, liquidity, or results of
operations.note 11-segment
information and geographic datain accordance with sfas no. 131, disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information,
the company reports segment information based on the management approach. the
management approach designates the internal reporting used by management for
making decisions and assessing performance as the source of the companys
reportable segments.the company manages its business primarily on a geographic
basis. the companys reportable operating segments are comprised of the
americas, europe, japan, and retail. the americas, europe, and japan reportable
segments do not include activities related to the retail segment. the americas
segment includes both north and south america. the europe segment includes
european countries as well as the middle east and africa. the retail segment
operates apple-owned retail stores in the u.s., canada, japan, and the u.k. other
operating segments include asia-pacific, which includes australia and asia
except for japan, and the companys subsidiary, filemaker, inc. each
reportable geographic operating segment provides similar hardware and software
products and similar services, and the accounting policies of the various
segments are the same as those described in note 1, summary of significant
accounting policies, except as described below for the retail segment.the company evaluates the performance of its operating
segments based on net sales. the retail segments performance is also evaluated
based on operating income. net sales for geographic segments are generally
based on the location of the customers. operating income for each segment
includes net sales to third parties, related cost of sales, and operating expenses
directly attributable to the segment. operating income for each segment
excludes other income and expense and certain expenses that are managed outside
the operating segments. costs excluded from segment operating income include
various corporate expenses such as manufacturing costs and variances not
included in standard costs, research and development, corporate marketing
expenses, stock-based compensation expense, income taxes, various nonrecurring
charges, and other separately managed general and administrative expenses
including certain corporate expenses associated with support of the retail
segment. the company does not include intercompany transfers between segments
for management reporting purposes. segment assets exclude corporate assets.
corporate assets include cash, short-term and long-term investments,
manufacturing facilities, miscellaneous corporate infrastructure, goodwill and
other acquired intangible assets, and retail store construction-in-progress
that is not subject to depreciation. except for the retail segment, capital109notes to consolidated financial statements (continued)note 11-segment
information and geographic data (continued)expenditures for long-lived assets are not reported to
management by segment. capital expenditures by the retail segment were $200
million, $132 million, and $104 million for 2006, 2005, and 2004,
respectively.operating income for all segments, except retail, includes cost of
sales at manufacturing standard cost, other cost of sales, related sales and
marketing costs, and certain general and administrative costs. this measure of
operating income, which includes manufacturing profit, provides a comparable
basis for comparison between the companys various geographic segments. certain
manufacturing expenses and related adjustments not included in segment cost of
sales, including variances between standard and actual manufacturing costs and
the mark-up above standard cost for product supplied to the retail segment, are
included in corporate expenses.management assesses the operating performance of the
retail segment differently than it assesses the operating performance of the
companys geographic segments. the retail segment revenue and operating income
is intended to depict a measure comparable to that of the companys major
channel partners in the u.s. operating retail stores so the company can
evaluate the retail segment performance as if it were a channel partner.
therefore, the company makes three significant adjustments to the retail
segment for management reporting purposes that are not included in the results
of the companys other segments.first, the retail segments operating income includes
cost of sales for apple products at an amount normally charged to major channel
partners in the u.s. operating retail stores, less the cost of sales programs
and incentives provided to those channel partners and the companys cost to
support those partners. for the years ended september 30, 2006, september 24,
2005, and september 25, 2004, this resulted in the recognition of
additional cost of sales above standard cost by the retail segment and an
offsetting benefit to corporate expenses of approximately $663 million, $435
million, and $213 million, respectively.second, the companys service and support contracts
are transferred to the retail segment at the same cost as that charged to the
companys major retail channel partners in the u.s., resulting in a measure of
revenue and gross margin for those items that is comparable between the companys
retail stores and those retail channel partners. the retail segment recognizes
the full amount of revenue and cost of sales of the companys service and
support contracts at the time of sale. because the company has not yet earned
the revenue or incurred the costs associated with the sale of these contracts,
an offset to these amounts is recognized in other operating segments net sales
and cost of sales. for the year ended september 30, 2006, this resulted in
the recognition of net sales and cost of sales by the retail segment, with
corresponding offsets in other operating segments, of $159 million and $109
million, respectively. for the year ended september 24, 2005, this
resulted in the recognition of net sales and cost of sales by the retail
segment of $92 million and $64 million, respectively. for the year ended september 25,
2004, this resulted in the recognition of net sales and cost of sales by the
retail segment of $54 million and $37 million, respectively.third, the company had opened a total of eight
high-profile stores as of september 30, 2006. these high-profile stores
are larger than the companys typical retail stores and were designed to
further promote brand awareness and provide a venue for certain corporate sales
and marketing activities, including corporate briefings. as such, the company
allocates certain operating expenses associated with these stores to corporate
marketing expense to reflect the estimated benefit realized company-wide. the
allocation of these operating costs is based on the amount incurred for a high-profile
store in excess of that incurred by a more typical company retail location.
expenses allocated to corporate marketing resulting110notes to consolidated financial statements (continued)note 11-segment
information and geographic data (continued)from the operations
of these stores were $33 million, $31 million, and $16 million for the years
ended september 30, 2006, september 24, 2005, and september 25,
2004, respectively.summary information by operating segment follows (in

assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the apple computer, inc.s
internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.we conducted our audit in accordance with the
standards of the public company accounting oversight board (united states).
those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was
maintained in all material respects. our audit included obtaining an

reasonable basis for our opinion.a companys internal control over financial reporting
is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability
of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external
purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. a companys
internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and
procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in
reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and
dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable
assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of
financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made
only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the
company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or
timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.because of inherent limitations, internal control over
financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. also, projections
of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk
that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that
the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.in our opinion, managements assessment that apple

## Item 1A


in the event of
renewed financial turmoil affecting the banking system and financial markets, additional consolidation of the financial services industry, or significant financial service institution failures, there could be a new or incremental tightening in
the credit markets, low liquidity, and extreme volatility in fixed income, credit, currency, and equity markets. in addition, the risk remains that there could be a number of follow-on effects from the credit crisis on the
companys business, including the insolvency of key outsourced manufacturing partners or suppliers or their inability to obtain credit to finance development and/or manufacture products resulting in product delays; inability of customers,
including channel partners, to obtain credit to finance purchases of the companys products and/or customer, including channel partner, insolvencies; and failure of derivative counterparties and other financial institutions negatively
impacting the companys treasury operations. other income and expense also could vary materially from expectations depending on gains or losses realized on the sale or exchange of financial instruments; impairment charges resulting
from revaluations of debt and equity securities and other investments; interest rates; cash balances; and changes in fair value of derivative instruments. increased volatility in the financial markets and overall
economic uncertainty would increase the risk of the actual amounts realized in the future on the companys financial instruments differing significantly from the fair values currently assigned to them.uncertainty about current global economic conditions could also continue to increase the volatility of the companys stock price.global markets for the companys products and services are highly competitive and subject to rapid technological
change. if the company is unable to compete effectively in these markets, its financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected.the company competes in highly competitive global markets characterized by aggressive price cutting, with resulting downward pressure on gross margins, frequent introduction of new products, short product
life cycles, evolving industry standards, continual improvement in product price/performance characteristics, rapid adoption of technological and product advancements by competitors, and price sensitivity on the part of consumers.the companys ability to compete successfully depends heavily on its ability to ensure a continuing and timely introduction of
innovative new products and technologies to the marketplace. the company believes it is unique in that it designs and develops nearly the entire solution for its products, including the hardware, operating system, numerous software applications, and
related services. as a result, the company must make significant investments in research and development and as such, the company currently holds a significant number of patents and copyrights and has registered and/or has applied to register
numerous patents, trademarks and service marks. by contrast, many of the companys competitors seek to compete primarily through aggressive pricing and very low cost structures. if the company is unable to continue to develop and sell
innovative new products with attractive margins or if other companies infringe on the companys intellectual property, the companys ability to maintain a competitive advantage could be negatively affected and its financial condition and
operating results could be materially adversely affected.in the market for personal computers and peripherals, the company
faces a significant number of competitors, many of which have broader product lines, lower priced products, and larger installed customer bases. consolidation in this market has resulted in larger and potentially stronger competitors. price
competition has been particularly intense as competitors selling windows-based personal computers have aggressively cut prices and lowered product margins. the company also faces increased competition in key market segments, including consumer, smb,
education, enterprise, government and creative markets. an increasing number of internet devices that include software applications and are smaller and simpler than traditional personal computers compete for market share with the companys
existing products.the company is currently the only authorized maker of hardware using the mac os. the mac os has a minority
market share in the personal computer market, which is dominated by computer makers using competing operating systems, most notably windows. the companys financial condition and operating results depend substantially on the companys
ability to continually improve the mac platform to maintain functional and11



design advantages. use of unauthorized copies of the mac os on other companies hardware products may result in decreased demand for the companys hardware products, and could
materially adversely affect the companys financial condition and operating results.the company currently markets
certain mobile communication and media devices, and third-party digital content and applications. the company faces substantial competition from companies that have significant technical, marketing, distribution and other resources, as well as
established hardware, software and digital content supplier relationships. additionally, the company faces significant price competition as competitors reduce their selling prices and attempt to imitate the companys product features and
applications within their own products or, alternatively, collaborate with each other to offer solutions that are more competitive than those they currently offer. the company also competes with illegitimate ways to obtain third-party digital
content and applications. the company has only recently entered the mobile communications and media device markets, and many of its competitors in these markets have significantly greater experience, product breadth and distribution channels than
the company. because some current and potential competitors have substantial resources and/or experience and a lower cost structure, they may be able to provide such products and services at little or no profit or even at a loss. the company also
expects competition to intensify as competitors attempt to imitate the companys approach to providing these components seamlessly within their individual offerings or work collaboratively to offer integrated solutions.the company currently receives subsidies from its exclusive and non-exclusive carriers providing cellular network service for iphone.
there is no assurance that such subsidies will be continued at all or in the same amounts upon renewal of the companys agreements with these carriers or in agreements the company enters into with new carriers.there can be no assurance the company will be able to continue to provide products and services that compete effectively.to remain competitive and stimulate customer demand, the company must successfully manage frequent product introductions and
transitions.due to the highly volatile and competitive nature of the industries in which the company competes, the
company must continually introduce new products, services and technologies, enhance existing products and services, and effectively stimulate customer demand for new and upgraded products. the success of new product introductions depends on a number
of factors including but not limited to timely and successful product development, market acceptance, the companys ability to manage the risks associated with new products and production ramp issues, the availability of application software
for new products, the effective management of purchase commitments and inventory levels in line with anticipated product demand, the availability of products in appropriate quantities and costs to meet anticipated demand, and the risk that new
products may have quality or other defects in the early stages of introduction. accordingly, the company cannot determine in advance the ultimate effect of new product introductions and transitions on its financial condition and operating results.the company faces substantial inventory and other asset risk in addition to purchase commitment cancellation risk.the company records a write-down for product and component inventories that have become obsolete or exceed anticipated
demand or net realizable value and accrues necessary cancellation fee reserves for orders of excess products and components. the company also reviews its long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changed circumstances indicate the carrying
amount of an asset may not be recoverable. if the company determines that impairment has occurred, it records a write-down equal to the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds its fair market value. although the company believes its
provisions related to inventory, other assets and purchase commitments are currently adequate, no assurance can be given that the company will not incur additional related charges given the rapid and unpredictable pace of product obsolescence in the
industries in which the company competes. such charges could materially adversely affect the companys financial condition and operating results.12



the company must order
components for its products and build inventory in advance of product announcements and shipments. consistent with industry practice, components are normally acquired through a combination of purchase orders, supplier contracts, open orders and,
where appropriate, prepayments, in each case based on projected demand. such purchase commitments typically cover forecasted component and manufacturing requirements for 30 to 150 days. because the companys markets are volatile, competitive
and subject to rapid technology and price changes, there is a risk the company will forecast incorrectly and order or produce excess or insufficient inventories of components or products. the companys financial condition and operating results
have been in the past and could be in the future materially adversely affected by the companys ability to manage its inventory levels and respond to short-term shifts in customer demand patterns.future operating results depend upon the companys ability to obtain key components including but not limited to microprocessors,
nand flash memory, dram and lcds at favorable prices and in sufficient quantities.because the company currently obtains
certain key components including but not limited to microprocessors, enclosures, certain lcds, certain optical drives, and asics, from single or limited sources, the company is subject to significant supply and pricing risks. many of these and other
key components that are available from multiple sources including but not limited to nand flash memory, dram and certain lcds, are subject at times to industry-wide shortages and significant commodity pricing fluctuations. the company has entered
into certain agreements for the supply of key components including but not limited to microprocessors, nand flash memory, dram and lcds at favorable pricing, but there is no guarantee that the company will be able to extend or renew these agreements
on similar favorable terms, or at all, upon expiration or otherwise obtain favorable pricing in the future. the follow-on effects from the credit crisis on the companys key suppliers, referred to in economic conditions could
materially adversely affect the company above, which is incorporated herein by reference, also could affect the companys ability to obtain key components. therefore, the company remains subject to significant risks of supply
shortages and/or price increases that could materially adversely affect the companys financial condition and operating results. the company expects to experience decreases in its gross margin percentage in future periods, as compared to levels
achieved during 2010, largely due to a higher mix of new and innovative products that have higher cost structures and deliver greater value to customers, and expected and potential future component cost and other cost increases. for additional
information refer to part ii, item 7, managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations, under the subheading gross margin, which is incorporated herein by reference.the company and other participants in the personal computer, and mobile communication and media device industries compete for various
components with other industries that have experienced increased demand for their products. the company uses some custom components that are not common to the rest of these industries. the companys new products often utilize custom components
available from only one source. when a component or product uses new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers yields have matured or manufacturing capacity has increased. continued availability of these
components at acceptable prices, or at all, may be affected if those suppliers decided to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the companys requirements. if the supply of a key
single-sourced component for a new or existing product were delayed or constrained, if such components were available only at significantly higher prices, or if a key manufacturing vendor delayed shipments of completed products to the company, the
companys financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected.the company depends on
component and product manufacturing and logistical services provided by third parties, many of whom are located outside of the u.s.substantially all of the companys components and products are manufactured in whole or in part by a few third-party manufacturers. many of these manufacturers are located outside of the u.s., and
are concentrated in several general locations. the company has also outsourced much of its transportation and logistics management. while these arrangements may lower operating costs, they also reduce the companys direct control over
production and distribution. it is uncertain what effect such diminished control will have on the quality or quantity of13



products or services, or the companys flexibility to respond to changing conditions. in addition, the company relies on third-party manufacturers to adhere to the companys supplier
code of conduct. although arrangements with such manufacturers may contain provisions for warranty expense reimbursement, the company may remain responsible to the consumer for warranty service in the event of product defects. any unanticipated
product defect or warranty liability, whether pursuant to arrangements with contract manufacturers or otherwise, could materially adversely affect the companys reputation, financial condition and operating results.final assembly of the companys products is currently performed in the companys manufacturing facility in ireland, and by
external vendors in california, texas, china, the czech republic and korea. currently, the supply and manufacture of many critical components is performed by sole-sourced third-party vendors in the u.s., china, germany, ireland, israel, japan,
korea, malaysia, the netherlands, the philippines, taiwan, thailand and singapore. sole-sourced third-party vendors in china perform final assembly of substantially all of the companys mac products, iphones, ipads and ipods. if manufacturing
or logistics in these locations is disrupted for any reason, including but not limited to, natural disasters, information technology system failures, military actions or economic, business, labor, environmental, public health, or political issues,
the companys financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected.the company relies on
third-party digital content, which may not be available to the company on commercially reasonable terms or at all.the
company contracts with certain third parties to offer their digital content through the companys itunes store. the companys licensing arrangements with these third parties are short-term and do not guarantee the continuation or renewal
of these arrangements on reasonable terms, if at all. some third-party content providers currently or in the future may offer competing products and services, and could take action to make it more difficult or impossible for the company to license
their content in the future. other content owners, providers or distributors may seek to limit the companys access to, or increase the total cost of, such content. if the company is unable to continue to offer a wide variety of content at
reasonable prices with acceptable usage rules, or continue to expand its geographic reach, the companys financial condition and operating results may be materially adversely affected.many third-party content providers require that the company provide certain digital rights management (drm) and other
security solutions. if these requirements change, the company may have to develop or license new technology to provide these solutions. there is no assurance the company will be able to develop or license such solutions at a reasonable cost and in a
timely manner. in addition, certain countries have passed or may propose legislation that would force the company to license its drm, which could lessen the protection of content and subject it to piracy and also could affect arrangements with the
companys content providers.the company relies on access to third-party patents and intellectual property, and the
companys future results could be materially adversely affected if it is alleged or found to have infringed intellectual property rights.many of the companys products are designed to include third-party intellectual property, and in the future the company may need to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of its products
and business methods. although the company believes that, based on past experience and industry practice, such licenses generally could be obtained on reasonable terms, there is no assurance that the necessary licenses would be available on
acceptable terms or at all.because of technological changes in the industries in which the company competes, current
extensive patent coverage, and the rapid issuance of new patents, it is possible that certain components of the companys products and business methods may unknowingly infringe the patents or other intellectual property rights of third parties.
from time to time, the company has been notified that it may be infringing such rights. regardless of merit, responding to such claims can consume significant time and expense. at present, the company is vigorously defending a number of patent
infringement cases, and several pending claims are in various stages of evaluation. in certain cases, the company may consider the desirability of entering into licensing agreements, although no14



assurance can be given that such licenses can be obtained on acceptable terms or that litigation will not occur. if the company is found to be infringing such rights, it may be required to pay
substantial damages. if there is a temporary or permanent injunction prohibiting the company from marketing or selling certain products or a successful claim of infringement against the company requires it to pay royalties to a third party, the
companys financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected, regardless of whether it can develop non-infringing technology. while in managements opinion the company does not have a potential liability for
damages or royalties from any known current legal proceedings or claims related to the infringement of patent or other intellectual property rights that would individually or in the aggregate materially adversely affect its financial condition and
operating results, the results of such legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty. should the company fail to prevail in any of the matters related to infringement of patent or other intellectual property rights of others or should several
of these matters be resolved against the company in the same reporting period, the companys financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected.with the introduction of iphones and 3g enabled ipads, the company has begun to compete with mobile communication and media devices
companies that hold significant patent portfolios. regardless of the scope or validity of such patents or the merits of any potential patent claims by competitors, the company may have to engage in protracted litigation, enter into
expensive agreements or settlements and/or modify its products. any of these events could have a material adverse impact on the companys financial condition and operating results.the companys future performance depends on support from third-party software developers. if third-party software applications
and services cease to be developed and maintained for the companys products, customers may choose not to buy the companys products.the company believes decisions by customers to purchase its hardware products, including its macs, iphones, ipads and ipods, are often based to a certain extent on the availability of third-party software
applications and services. there is no assurance that third-party developers will continue to develop and maintain applications and services for the companys products on a timely basis or at all, and discontinuance or delay of these
applications and services could materially adversely affect the companys financial condition and operating results.with respect to its mac products, the company believes the availability of third-party software applications and services depends in part
on the developers perception and analysis of the relative benefits of developing, maintaining, and upgrading such software for the companys products compared to windows-based products. this analysis may be based on factors such as the
perceived strength of the company and its products, the anticipated revenue that may be generated, continued acceptance by customers of mac os x, and the costs of developing such applications and services. if the companys minority share of the
global personal computer market causes developers to question the companys prospects, developers could be less inclined to develop or upgrade software for the companys products and more inclined to devote their resources to developing
and upgrading software for the larger windows market. the companys development of its own software applications and services may also negatively affect the decisions of third-party developers, such as microsoft, adobe and google, to develop,
maintain, and upgrade similar or competitive software and services for the companys products.with respect to iphone,
ipad and ipod touch, the company relies on the continued availability and development of compelling and innovative software applications. unlike third-party software applications for mac products, the software applications for the iphone, ipad and
ipod touch platforms are distributed through a single distribution channel, the app store. the absence of multiple distribution channels, which are available for competing platforms, may limit the availability and acceptance of third-party
applications by the companys customers, thereby causing developers to curtail significantly, or stop, development for the companys platforms. in addition, iphone, ipad and ipod touch are subject to rapid technological change, and, if
third-party developers are unable to keep up with this pace of change, third-party applications might not successfully operate and may result in dissatisfied customers. further, if the company develops its own software applications and services,
such development may negatively affect the decisions of third-party developers to develop, maintain,15



and upgrade similar or competitive applications for the iphone, ipad and ipod touch platforms. as with applications for the companys mac products, the availability and development of these
applications also depend on developers perceptions and analysis of the relative benefits of developing software for the companys products rather than its competitors products, including devices that use competing platforms. if
developers focus their efforts on these competing platforms, the availability and quality of applications for the companys devices may suffer.the companys future operating performance depends on the performance of distributors, carriers and other resellers.the company distributes its products through wholesalers, resellers, national and regional retailers, value-added resellers, and cataloguers, many of whom distribute products from competing manufacturers.
the company also sells many of its products and resells third-party products in most of its major markets directly to customers, certain education customers, cellular network carriers distribution channels and certain resellers through its
online and retail stores.many resellers operate on narrow operating margins and have been negatively affected in the past by
weak economic conditions. some resellers have perceived the expansion of the companys direct sales as conflicting with their business interests as distributors and resellers of the companys products. such a perception could discourage
resellers from investing resources in the distribution and sale of the companys products or lead them to limit or cease distribution of those products. the companys financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely
affected if the financial condition of these resellers weakens, if resellers stopped distributing the companys products, or if uncertainty regarding demand for the companys products caused resellers to reduce their ordering and marketing
of the companys products. the company has invested and will continue to invest in programs to enhance reseller sales, including staffing selected resellers stores with company employees and contractors and improving product placement
displays. these programs could require a substantial investment while providing no assurance of return or incremental revenue.the companys retail business has required and will continue to require a substantial investment and commitment of resources and
is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties.the companys retail stores have required substantial fixed
investment in equipment and leasehold improvements, information systems, inventory and personnel. the company also has entered into substantial operating lease commitments for retail space, with terms ranging from five to 20 years, the majority of
which are for ten years. certain stores have been designed and built to serve as high-profile venues to promote brand awareness and serve as vehicles for corporate sales and marketing activities. because of their unique design elements, locations
and size, these stores require substantially more investment than the companys more typical retail stores. due to the high fixed cost structure associated with the retail segment, a decline in sales or the closure or poor performance of
individual or multiple stores could result in significant lease termination costs, write-offs of equipment and leasehold improvements, and severance costs that could materially adversely affect the companys financial condition and operating
results.many factors unique to retail operations, some of which are beyond the companys control, pose risks and
uncertainties that could materially adversely affect the companys financial condition and operating results. these risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, macro-economic factors that could have a negative effect on general
retail activity, as well as the companys inability to manage costs associated with store construction and operation, inability to sell third-party products at adequate margins, failure to manage relationships with existing retail channel
partners, more challenging environment in managing retail operations outside the u.s., costs associated with unanticipated fluctuations in the value of retail inventory, and inability to obtain and renew leases in quality retail locations at a
reasonable cost.16



investment in new
business strategies and initiatives could disrupt the companys ongoing business and present risks not originally contemplated.the company has invested, and in the future may invest, in new business strategies or acquisitions. such endeavors may involve significant risks and uncertainties, including distraction of management from
current operations, insufficient revenue to offset liabilities assumed and expenses associated with the strategy, inadequate return of capital, and unidentified issues not discovered in the companys due diligence. because these new ventures
are inherently risky, no assurance can be given that such strategies and initiatives will be successful and will not materially adversely affect the companys financial condition and operating results.the companys products and services experience quality problems from time to time that can result in decreased sales and
operating margin.the company sells highly complex hardware and software products and services that can contain defects in
design and manufacture. sophisticated operating system software and applications, such as those sold by the company, often contain bugs that can unexpectedly interfere with the softwares intended operation. defects may also occur
in components and products the company purchases from third parties. there can be no assurance the company will be able to detect and fix all defects in the hardware, software and services it sells. failure to do so could result in lost revenue,
harm to reputation, and significant warranty and other expenses, and could have a material adverse impact on the companys financial condition and operating results.in the u.s. the company relies on a single cellular network carrier to provide service for iphone.in the u.s. the company has contracted with a single carrier to provide cellular network services for iphone on an exclusive basis. if this exclusive carrier cannot successfully compete with other
carriers in the u.s. market on any basis, including but not limited to the quality and coverage of wireless voice and data services, performance and timely build-out of advanced wireless networks, and pricing and other terms or conditions of
customer contracts, or if this exclusive carrier fails to promote iphone aggressively or favor other handsets in their promotion and sales activities or service plans, sales may be materially adversely affected.the company is subject to risks associated with laws, regulations and industry-imposed standards related to mobile communications and
media devices.laws and regulations related to mobile communications and media devices in the many jurisdictions in which
the company operates are extensive and subject to change. such changes, which could include but are not limited to restrictions on production, manufacture, distribution, and use of the device, locking the device to a carriers network, or
mandating the use of the device on more than one carriers network, could materially adversely affect the companys financial condition and operating results.mobile communication and media devices, such as iphones and 3g enabled ipads, are subject to certification and regulation by governmental and standardization bodies, as well as by cellular network
carriers for use on their networks. these certification processes are extensive and time consuming, and could result in additional testing requirements, product modifications or delays in product shipment dates, which could materially adversely
affect the companys financial condition and operating results.the companys success depends largely on the
continued service and availability of key personnel.much of the companys future success depends on the continued
availability and service of key personnel, including its ceo, its executive team and highly skilled employees in technical, marketing and staff positions. experienced personnel in the technology industry are in high demand and competition for their
talents is intense, especially in the silicon valley, where most of the companys key personnel are located. there can be no assurance that the company will continue to attract and retain key personnel.17



political events,
war, terrorism, public health issues, natural disasters and other circumstances could materially adversely affect the company.war, terrorism, geopolitical uncertainties, public health issues, and other business interruptions have caused and could cause damage or disruption to international commerce and the global economy, and
thus could have a strong negative effect on the company, its suppliers, logistics providers, manufacturing vendors and customers, including channel partners. the companys business operations are subject to interruption by natural disasters,
fire, power shortages, terrorist attacks, and other hostile acts, labor disputes, public health issues, and other events beyond its control. such events could decrease demand for the companys products, make it difficult or impossible for the
company to make and deliver products to its customers, including channel partners, or to receive components from its suppliers, and create delays and inefficiencies in the companys supply chain. should major public health issues, including
pandemics, arise, the company could be negatively affected by more stringent employee travel restrictions, additional limitations in freight services, governmental actions limiting the movement of products between regions, delays in production ramps
of new products, and disruptions in the operations of the companys manufacturing vendors and component suppliers. the majority of the companys research and development activities, its corporate headquarters, information technology
systems, and other critical business operations, including certain component suppliers and manufacturing vendors, are in locations that could be affected by natural disasters. in the event of a natural disaster, losses and significant recovery time
could be required to resume operations and the companys financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected.the company may be subject to information technology system failures, network disruptions and breaches in data security.information technology system failures, network disruptions and breaches of data security caused by such factors, including but not limited to, earthquakes, fire, theft, fraud, malicious attack or other
causes could disrupt the companys operations by causing delays or cancellation of customer, including channel partner, orders, negatively affecting the companys online, itunes, mobileme and retail offerings and services, impeding the
manufacture or shipment of products, processing transactions and reporting financial results, resulting in the unintentional disclosure of customer or company information, or damage to the companys reputation. while management has taken steps
to address these concerns by implementing sophisticated network security and internal control measures, there can be no assurance that a system failure or loss or data security breach will not materially adversely affect the companys financial
condition and operating results.the company expects its quarterly revenue and operating results to fluctuate for a
variety of reasons.the companys profit margins vary among its products and its distribution channels. the
companys software, accessories, and service and support contracts generally have higher gross margins than certain of the companys other products. gross margins on the companys hardware products vary across product lines and can
change over time as a result of product transitions, pricing and configuration changes, and component, warranty, and other cost fluctuations. the companys direct sales generally have higher associated gross margins than its indirect sales
through its channel partners. in addition, the companys gross margin and operating margin percentages, as well as overall profitability, may be materially adversely impacted as a result of a shift in product, geographic or channel mix, new
products, component cost increases, strengthening u.s. dollar, or price competition. the company has typically experienced greater net sales in the first and fourth fiscal quarters compared to the second and third fiscal quarters due to seasonal
demand related to the holiday season and the beginning of the school year, respectively. furthermore, the company sells more products from time-to-time during the third month of a quarter than it does during either of the first two months.
developments late in a quarter, such as lower-than-anticipated demand for the companys products, issues with new product introductions, an internal systems failure, or failure of one of the companys key logistics, components supply, or
manufacturing partners, could have a material adverse impact on the companys financial condition and operating results.18



the companys
stock price continues to be volatile.the companys stock has at times experienced substantial price volatility due
to a number of factors, including but not limited to variations between its actual and anticipated financial results, announcements by the company and its competitors, and uncertainty about current global economic conditions. the stock market as a
whole also has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market price of many technology companies in ways that may have been unrelated to these companies operating performance. furthermore, the company believes
its stock price reflects high future growth and profitability expectations. if the company fails to meet these expectations its stock price may significantly decline, which could have a material adverse impact on investor confidence and employee
retention.the companys business is subject to the risks of international operations.the company derives a significant portion of its revenue and earnings from its international operations. compliance with u.s. and foreign
laws and regulations that apply to the companys international operations, including without limitation import and export requirements, anti-corruption laws, tax laws (including u.s. taxes on foreign subsidiaries), foreign exchange controls and
cash repatriation restrictions, data privacy requirements, labor laws, and anti-competition regulations, increases the costs of doing business in foreign jurisdictions, and any such costs, which may rise in the future as a result of changes in these
laws and regulations or in their interpretation. furthermore, the company has implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these laws and regulations, but there can be no assurance that the companys employees,
contractors, or agents will not violate such laws and regulations or the companys policies. any such violations could individually or in the aggregate materially adversely affect the companys financial condition or operating results.the companys financial condition and operating results also could be significantly affected by other risks associated
with international activities, including but not limited to, economic and labor conditions, increased duties, taxes and other costs, political instability, and changes in the value of the u.s. dollar versus local currencies. margins on sales of the
companys products in foreign countries, and on sales of products that include components obtained from foreign suppliers, could be materially adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and by international trade
regulations, including duties, tariffs and antidumping penalties. additionally, the company is exposed to credit and collectability risk on its trade receivables with customers in certain international markets. there can be no assurance it can
effectively limit its credit risk and avoid losses, which could materially adversely affect the companys financial condition and operating results.the companys primary exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates relate to non-u.s. dollar denominated sales in europe, japan, australia, canada and certain parts of asia, as well as
non-u.s. dollar denominated operating expenses incurred throughout the world. weakening of foreign currencies relative to the u.s. dollar will adversely affect the u.s. dollar value of the companys foreign currency-denominated sales and
earnings, and generally will lead the company to raise international pricing, potentially reducing demand for the companys products. in some circumstances, due to competition or other reasons, the company may decide not to raise local prices
to the full extent of the dollars strengthening, or at all, which would adversely affect the u.s. dollar value of the companys foreign currency denominated sales and earnings. conversely, a strengthening of foreign currencies, while
generally beneficial to the companys foreign currency-denominated sales and earnings, could cause the company to reduce international pricing and incur losses on its foreign currency derivative instruments, thereby limiting the benefit.
additionally, strengthening of foreign currencies may also increase the companys cost of product components denominated in those currencies, thus adversely affecting gross margins.the company has used derivative instruments, such as foreign currency forward and option contracts, to hedge certain exposures to
fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. the use of such hedging activities may not offset any or more than a portion of the adverse financial effects of unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates over the limited time the hedges are in
place.19



the company is
exposed to credit risk and fluctuations in the market values of its investment portfolio.although the company has not
recognized any significant losses to date on its cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, any significant future declines in their market values could materially adversely affect the companys financial condition and operating results.
given the global nature of its business, the company has investments both domestically and internationally. credit ratings and pricing of these investments can be negatively impacted by liquidity, credit deterioration or losses, financial results,
or other factors. as a result, the value or liquidity of the companys cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities could decline and result in a material impairment, which could materially adversely affect the companys financial
condition and operating results.the company is exposed to credit risk on its trade accounts receivable, vendor non-trade
receivables and prepayments related to long-term supply agreements. this risk is heightened during periods when economic conditions worsen.the company distributes its products through third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers and value-added resellers. a substantial majority of the companys outstanding trade
receivables are not covered by collateral or credit insurance. the companys exposure to credit and collectability risk on its trade receivables are increased in certain international markets and its ability to mitigate such risks may be
limited. cellular network carriers accounted for a significant potion of the companys trade receivables as of september 25, 2010. the company also has unsecured vendor non-trade receivables resulting from purchases of components by
contract manufacturers and other vendors that manufacture sub-assemblies or assemble final products for the company. two vendors accounted for a significant portion of the companys non-trade receivables as of september 25, 2010. in
addition, the company has made prepayments associated with long-term supply agreements to secure supply of certain inventory components. while the company has procedures to monitor and limit exposure to credit risk on its trade and vendor non-trade
receivables as well as long-term prepayments, there can be no assurance such procedures will effectively limit its credit risk and avoid losses, which could materially adversely affect the companys financial condition and operating results.the matters relating to the companys past stock option practices and its restatement of consolidated financial
statements may result in additional litigation.the companys investigation into its past stock option practices and
its restatement of prior financial statements in the annual report on form 10-k for the year ended september 30, 2006 gave rise to litigation and government investigations. as described in part i, item 3, legal proceedings,
several derivative and class action complaints regarding stock options were filed against the company and current and former officers and directors. these actions have been dismissed following a comprehensive settlement. two former officers of the
company were also named as defendants in an sec enforcement action, which has been settled.no assurance can be given that
additional actions will not be filed against the company and current and former officers and directors as a result of past stock option practices. if such actions are filed and result in adverse findings, the remedies could materially adversely
affect the companys financial condition and operating results.unfavorable results of legal proceedings could
materially adversely affect the company.the company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that have arisen
out of the ordinary conduct of its business and are not yet resolved and additional claims may arise in the future. results of legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty. regardless of merit, litigation may be both time-consuming and
disruptive to the companys operations and cause significant expense and diversion of management attention. in recognition of these considerations, the company may enter into material settlements. should the company fail to prevail in certain
matters, or should several of these matters be resolved against the company in the same reporting period, the company may be faced with significant monetary damages or injunctive relief against it that would materially adversely affect a portion of
its business and might materially affect the companys financial condition and operating results.20

the mac; iphone, ipad and ipod and related software; development of new digital lifestyle consumer and professional software applications; and investing in new product areas and technologies. the
company also believes increased investment in marketing and advertising programs is critical to increasing product and brand awareness.the company utilizes a variety of direct and indirect distribution channels, including its retail stores, online stores, and direct sales force, and third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers,
retailers, and value-added resellers. the company believes that sales of its innovative and differentiated products are enhanced by knowledgeable salespersons who can convey the value of the hardware, software, and peripheral integration,
demonstrate the unique digital lifestyle solutions that are available on its products, and demonstrate the compatibility of the mac with the windows platform and networks. the company further believes providing direct contact with its targeted
customers is an effective way to demonstrate the advantages of its products over those of its competitors and providing a high-quality sales and after-sales support experience is critical to attracting new and retaining existing customers. to ensure
a high-quality buying experience for its products in which service and education are emphasized, the company continues to expand and improve its distribution capabilities by expanding the number of its own retail stores worldwide. additionally, the
company has invested in programs to enhance reseller sales by placing high quality apple fixtures, merchandising materials and other resources within selected third-party reseller locations. through the apple premium reseller program, certain
third-party resellers focus on the apple platform by providing a high level of integration and support services, and product expertise.critical accounting policies and estimatesthe preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles (gaap) and the companys discussion and analysis of its
financial condition and operating results require the companys management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported in its consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. note 1, summary of
significant accounting policies of notes to consolidated financial statements in this form 10-k describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the companys consolidated financial statements.
management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and
liabilities. actual results may differ from these estimates and such differences may be material.management believes the
companys critical accounting policies and estimates are those related to revenue recognition, valuation and impairment of marketable securities, inventory valuation and inventory purchase commitments, warranty costs, income taxes, and legal
and other contingencies. management considers these policies critical because they are both important to the portrayal of the companys financial condition and operating results, and they require management to make judgments and estimates about
inherently uncertain matters. the companys senior management has reviewed these critical accounting policies and related disclosures with the audit and finance committee of the companys board of directors.revenue recognitionnet
sales consist primarily of revenue from the sale of hardware, software, digital content and applications, peripherals, and service and support contracts. the company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has
occurred, the sales price is fixed or determinable, and collection is probable. product is considered delivered to the customer once it has been shipped and title and risk of loss have been transferred. for most of the companys product sales,
these criteria are met at the time the product is shipped. for online sales to individuals, for some sales to education customers in the u.s., and for certain other sales, the company defers recognition of revenue until the customer receives the
product because the company retains a portion of the risk of loss on these sales during transit. the company recognizes revenue from the sale of hardware products (e.g., macs, iphones, ipads, ipods and peripherals), software bundled with hardware
that is28



essential to the functionality of the hardware, and third-party digital content sold on the itunes store in accordance with general revenue recognition accounting guidance. the company recognizes
revenue in accordance with industry specific software accounting guidance for the following types of sales transactions: (i) standalone sales of software products, (ii) sales of software upgrades and (iii) sales of software bundled
with hardware not essential to the functionality of the hardware.for multi-element arrangements that include tangible
products containing software essential to the tangible products functionality and undelivered software elements relating to the tangible products essential software, the company allocates revenue to all deliverables based on their
relative selling prices. in such circumstances, the company uses a hierarchy to determine the selling price to be used for allocating revenue to deliverables: (i) vendor-specific objective evidence of fair value (vsoe),
(ii) third-party evidence of selling price (tpe) and (iii) best estimate of the selling price (esp). vsoe generally exists only when the company sells the deliverable separately and is the price actually charged by
the company for that deliverable. esps reflect the companys best estimates of what the selling prices of elements would be if they were sold regularly on a stand-alone basis.for all past and current sales of iphone, ipad, apple tv and for sales of ipod touch beginning in june 2010, the company indicated it
might from time-to-time provide future unspecified software upgrades and features free of charge to customers. the company has identified two deliverables in arrangements involving the sale of these devices. the first deliverable is the hardware and
software essential to the functionality of the hardware device delivered at the time of sale. the second deliverable is the embedded right included with the purchase of iphone, ipad, ipod touch and apple tv to receive on a when-and-if-available
basis, future unspecified software upgrades and features relating to the products essential software. the company has allocated revenue between these two deliverables using the relative selling price method. because the company has neither
vsoe nor tpe for the two deliverables, the allocation of revenue has been based on the companys esps. amounts allocated to the delivered hardware and the related essential software are recognized at the time of sale provided the other
conditions for revenue recognition have been met. amounts allocated to the embedded unspecified software upgrade right are deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis over the 24-month estimated life of each of these devices. all product cost
of sales, including estimated warranty costs, are recognized at the time of sale. costs for engineering and sales and marketing are expensed as incurred. if the estimated life of the hardware product should change, the future rate of amortization of
the revenue allocated to the software upgrade right will also change.the companys process for determining its esp for
deliverables without vsoe or tpe involves managements judgment. the companys process considers multiple factors that may vary depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each deliverable. the company believes its
customers, particularly consumers, would be reluctant to buy unspecified software upgrade rights related to iphone, ipad, ipod touch and apple tv. this view is primarily based on the fact that unspecified upgrade rights do not obligate the company
to provide upgrades at a particular time or at all, and do not specify to customers which upgrades or features will be delivered. therefore, the company has concluded if it were to sell upgrade rights on a standalone basis, including those rights
associated with iphone, ipad, ipod touch and apple tv, the selling price would be relatively low. key factors considered by the company in developing the esps for these upgrade rights include prices charged by the company for similar offerings, the
companys historical pricing practices, the nature of the upgrade rights (e.g., unspecified and when-and-if-available), and the relative esp of the upgrade rights as compared to the total selling price of the product. the company may also
consider, when appropriate, the impact of other products and services, including advertising services, on selling price assumptions when developing and reviewing its esps for software upgrade rights and related deliverables. the company may also
consider additional factors as appropriate, including the pricing of competitive alternatives if they exist, and product-specific business objectives. if the facts and circumstances underlying the factors considered change or should future facts and
circumstances lead the company to consider additional factors, the companys esp for software upgrades related to future sales for these devices could change.29



beginning in the third
quarter of 2010 in conjunction with the announcement of ios 4, the companys esps for the embedded software upgrade rights included with iphone, ipad and ipod touch reflect the positive financial impact expected by the company as a result of
its introduction of a mobile advertising platform for these devices and the expectation of customers regarding software that includes or supports an advertising component. ios 4 supports iad, the companys new mobile advertising platform, which
enables applications on iphone, ipad and ipod touch to feature media-rich advertisements within applications.the company
records reductions to revenue for estimated commitments related to price protection and for customer incentive programs, including reseller and end-user rebates, and other sales programs and volume-based incentives. for transactions involving price
protection, the company recognizes revenue net of the estimated amount to be refunded, provided the refund amount can be reasonably and reliably estimated and the other conditions for revenue recognition have been met. the companys policy
requires that, if refunds cannot be reliably estimated, revenue is not recognized until reliable estimates can be made or the price protection lapses. for customer incentive programs, the estimated cost of these programs is recognized at the later
of the date at which the company has sold the product or the date at which the program is offered. the company also records reductions to revenue for expected future product returns based on the companys historical experience. future market
conditions and product transitions may require the company to increase customer incentive programs and incur incremental price protection obligations that could result in additional reductions to revenue at the time such programs are offered.
additionally, certain customer incentive programs require management to estimate the number of customers who will actually redeem the incentive. managements estimates are based on historical experience and the specific terms and conditions of
particular incentive programs. if a greater than estimated proportion of customers redeem such incentives, the company would be required to record additional reductions to revenue, which would have a negative impact on the companys results of
operations.valuation and impairment of marketable securitiesthe companys investments in available-for-sale securities are reported at fair value. unrealized gains and losses related to changes in the fair value of investments are included in accumulated
other comprehensive income, net of tax, as reported in the companys condensed consolidated balance sheets. changes in the fair value of investments impact the companys net income only when such investments are sold or an
other-than-temporary impairment is recognized. realized gains and losses on the sale of securities are determined by specific identification of each securitys cost basis. the company regularly reviews its investment portfolio to determine if
any investment is other-than-temporarily impaired due to changes in credit risk or other potential valuation concerns, which would require the company to record an impairment charge in the period any such determination is made. in making this
judgment, the company evaluates, among other things, the duration and extent to which the fair value of an investment is less than its cost, the financial condition of the issuer and any changes thereto, and the companys intent to sell, or
whether it is more likely than not it will be required to sell, the investment before recovery of the investments amortized cost basis. the companys assessment on whether an investment is other-than-temporarily impaired or not, could
change in the future due to new developments or changes in assumptions related to any particular investment.inventory valuation and
inventory purchase commitmentsthe company must order components for its products and build inventory in advance of
product shipments. the company records a write-down for inventories of components and products, including third-party products held for resale, which have become obsolete or are in excess of anticipated demand or net realizable value. the company
performs a detailed review of inventory each fiscal quarter that considers multiple factors including demand forecasts, product life cycle status, product development plans, current sales levels, and component cost trends. the industries in which
the company competes are subject to a rapid and unpredictable pace of product and component obsolescence and demand changes. if future demand or market conditions for the companys products are less favorable than forecasted or if unforeseen
technological changes negatively impact the utility of component inventory, the company may be required to record additional write-downs, which would negatively affect its results of operations in the period when the write-downs were recorded.30



the company records
accruals for estimated cancellation fees related to component orders that have been cancelled or are expected to be cancelled. consistent with industry practice, the company acquires components through a combination of purchase orders, supplier
contracts, and open orders based on projected demand information. these commitments typically cover the companys requirements for periods ranging from 30 to 150 days. if there is an abrupt and substantial decline in demand for one or more of
the companys products or an unanticipated change in technological requirements for any of the companys products, the company may be required to record additional accruals for cancellation fees that would negatively affect its results of
operations in the period when the cancellation fees are identified and recorded.warranty coststhe company provides for the estimated cost of hardware and software warranties at the time the related revenue is recognized based on
historical and projected warranty claim rates, historical and projected cost-per-claim, and knowledge of specific product failures that are outside of the companys typical experience. each quarter, the company reevaluates its estimates to
assess the adequacy of its recorded warranty liabilities considering the size of the installed base of products subject to warranty protection and adjusts the amounts as necessary. if actual product failure rates or repair costs differ from
estimates, revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required and could materially affect the companys results of operations.the company periodically provides updates to its applications and operating system software to maintain the softwares compliance with specifications. the estimated cost to develop such updates is
accounted for as warranty cost that is recognized at the time related software revenue is recognized. factors considered in determining appropriate accruals related to such updates include the number of units delivered, the number of updates
expected to occur, and the historical cost and estimated future cost of the resources necessary to develop these updates.income taxesthe company records a tax provision for the anticipated tax consequences of the reported results of operations. in
accordance with gaap, the provision for income taxes is computed using the asset and liability method, under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the
financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in effect for the
years in which those tax assets are expected to be realized or settled. the company records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is believed more likely than not to be realized.the company only recognizes the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be
sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50%
likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement.management believes it is more likely than not that forecasted income,
including income that may be generated as a result of certain tax planning strategies, together with future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, will be sufficient to fully recover the deferred tax assets. in the event that the
company determines all or part of the net deferred tax assets are not realizable in the future, the company will make an adjustment to the valuation allowance that would be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made. in addition,
the calculation of tax liabilities involves significant judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of gaap and complex tax laws. resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with managements
expectations could have a material impact on the companys financial condition and operating results.31



legal and other contingenciesas discussed in part i, item 3 of this form 10-k under the heading legal proceedings and in note 8
commitments and contingencies in notes to consolidated financial statements, the company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business. in accordance with gaap, the company records a
liability when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable. there is significant judgment required in both the probability determination and as to whether an exposure can be reasonably estimated. in
managements opinion, the company does not have a potential liability related to any current legal proceedings and claims that would individually or in the aggregate materially adversely affect its financial condition or operating results.
however, the outcomes of legal proceedings and claims brought against the company are subject to significant uncertainty. should the company fail to prevail in any of these legal matters or should several of these legal matters be resolved against
the company in the same reporting period, the operating results of a particular reporting period could be materially adversely affected.32

net sales of iphone and related products and services accounted for 39% of the companys total net sales for the year. iphone unit sales totaled 40 million in 2010, which represents an increase of 19.3 million or 93% compared to 2009.
iphone year-over-year growth was attributable primarily to continued growth from existing carriers, expanded distribution with new international carriers and resellers, and strong demand for iphone 4, which was released in the u.s. in june 2010 and
in many other countries over the remainder of 2010. as of september 25, 2010, the company distributed iphone in 89 countries through 166 carriers.net sales of ipad and related products and services were $5.0 billion and unit sales of ipad were 7.5 million during 2010. ipad was released in
the u.s. in april 2010 and in various other countries over the remainder of 2010. as of september 25, 2010, the company distributed ipad in 26 countries. the company distributes ipad through its direct channels, certain cellular network
carriers distribution channels and certain third-party resellers. net sales of ipad and related products and services accounted for 8% of the companys total net sales for 2010, reflecting the strong demand for ipad during the five months
following its release.mac net sales increased by $3.6 billion or 26% in 2010 compared to 2009, and mac unit sales increased by 3.3 million or 31% in 2010 compared to
2009. net sales per mac unit sold decreased by 4% in 2010 compared to 2009 due primarily to lower average selling prices of mac portable systems. net sales of the companys macs accounted for 27% of the companys total net sales in 2010
compared to 32% in 2009. during 2010, net sales and unit sales of the companys mac portable systems increased by 18% and 25%, respectively, primarily attributable to strong demand for macbook pro, which was updated in april 2010. net sales and
unit sales of the companys mac desktop systems increased by 43% and 45%, respectively, as a result of higher sales of imac, which was updated in july 2010.net sales of other music related products and services increased $912 million or 23% during 2010 compared to 2009. this increase was due primarily
to growth of the itunes store which generated total net sales of $4.1 billion for 2010. the results of the itunes store reflect growth of the itunes app store, continued growth in the installed base of iphone, ipad, and ipod customers, and the
expansion of third-party audio and video content available for sale and rent via the itunes store. the company continues to expand its itunes content and applications offerings around the world. net sales of other music related products and services
accounted for 8% of the companys total net sales for 2010.net sales of ipods increased $183 million or 2% during 2010, while ipod unit sales declined by 7% during 2010 compared to 2009. net sales per ipod
unit sold increased by 10% to $164 in 2010 compared to 2009, due to a shift in product mix toward ipod touch. ipod touch had strong growth in each of the companys reportable operating segments. net sales of ipods accounted for 13% of the
companys total net sales for the year compared to 19% in 2009.34



fiscal year 2009 versus 2008net sales during 2009 increased $5.4 billion or 14% compared to 2008. several factors contributed positively to these
increases, including the following:iphone revenue and net sales of related products and services amounted to $13.0 billion in 2009, an increase of $6.3 billion or 93% compared to
2008. the year-over-year iphone revenue growth is largely attributable to the year-over-year increase in iphone handset unit sales. iphone handset unit sales totaled 20.7 million during 2009, which represents an increase of 9.1 million or
78% during 2009 compared to 2008. this growth is attributed primarily to expanded distribution and strong overall demand for iphones. iphone 3gs was released in the u.s. on june 19, 2009 and in many other countries over the remainder of 2009.net sales of other music-related products and services increased $696 million or 21% during 2009 compared to 2008. the increase was due
predominantly to increased net sales of third-party digital content and applications from the itunes store, which experienced double-digit growth in each of the companys geographic segments during 2009 compared to the same period in 2008. the
company believes this is attributable primarily to continued interest in and growth of the itunes app store, continued growth in the companys base of iphone, ipad, and ipod customers, and the expansion of third-party audio and video content
available for sale and rent via the itunes storepartially offsetting the favorable factors discussed
above, net sales during 2009 were negatively impacted by certain factors, including the following:net sales of ipods decreased $1.1 billion or 12% during 2009 compared to 2008. ipod unit sales decreased by 1% during 2009 compared to 2008. net
sales per ipod unit sold decreased 11% to $149 in 2009 compared to 2008, resulting from lower average selling prices across all of the ipod product lines, due primarily to price reductions taken with the introduction of new ipods in september 2009
and september 2008 and a stronger u.s. dollar, offset partially by a higher mix of ipod touch sales.mac net sales declined 3% during 2009 compared to 2008, while mac unit sales increased by 7% over the same period. net sales per mac unit sold
decreased by 10% during 2009 compared to 2008, due primarily to lower average selling prices across all mac portable and desktop systems and a stronger u.s. dollar. net sales of macs accounted for 32% of the companys total net sales for 2009.
during 2009, mac portable systems net sales and unit sales increased by 9% and 20%, respectively, compared to 2008. this growth was driven by strong demand for macbook pro, which was updated in june 2009 and october 2008, and which experienced
double-digit net sales and unit growth in each of the companys reportable operating segments compared to the same period in 2008. the company also had a higher mix of mac portable systems sales, which is consistent with overall personal
computer market trends. net sales and unit sales of the companys mac desktop systems decreased by 23% and 14%, respectively, during 2009 compared to 2008. the decrease in net sales of mac desktop systems was due mainly to a shift in product
mix towards lower-priced desktops, lower average selling prices across all mac desktop systems and a stronger u.s. dollar.segment operating performancethe company manages its business primarily on a geographic basis. the companys reportable operating and reporting segments consist of the americas, europe, japan, asia-pacific and retail operations.

americasduring 2010, net sales in the americas segment increased $5.5 billion or 29% compared to 2009. this increase in net sales was driven by
increased iphone revenue, strong demand for ipad, continued demand for mac desktop and portable systems, and higher sales of third-party digital content and applications from the itunes store. americas mac net sales and unit sales increased 18% and
21%, respectively, during 2010 compared to 2009, largely due to strong demand for macbook pro. the americas segment represented 37% and 44% of the companys total net sales in 2010 and 2009, respectively.during 2009, net sales in the americas segment increased $2.4 billion or 15% compared to 2008. the increase in net sales during 2009 was
attributable to the significant year-over-year increase in iphone revenue, higher sales of third-party digital content and applications from the itunes store, and increased sales of mac portable systems, partially offset by a decrease in sales of
mac desktop systems and ipods. americas mac net sales decreased 6% due primarily to lower average selling prices, while mac unit sales increased by 4% on a year-over-year basis. the increase in mac unit sales was due primarily to strong demand for
the macbook pro. the americas segment represented approximately 44% of the companys total net sales in both 2009 and 2008.europeduring 2010, net sales in europe increased $6.9 billion or 58% compared to 2009. the growth in net sales was due mainly to

respectively.during 2009, net sales in europe increased $2.6 billion or 28% compared to 2008. the increase in net sales was
due mainly to increased iphone revenue and strong sales of mac portable systems, offset partially by lower net sales of mac desktop systems, ipods, and a stronger u.s. dollar. mac unit sales increased 13% in 2009 compared to 2008, which was driven
primarily by increased sales of mac portable systems, particularly macbook pro, while total mac net sales declined as a result of lower average selling prices across all mac products. ipod net sales decreased year-over-year as a result of lower
average selling prices, partially offset by increased unit sales of the higher priced ipod touch. the europe segment represented 28% and 25% of total net sales in 2009 and 2008, respectively.japanduring 2010, japans net sales increased $1.7 billion or 75%
compared to 2009. the primary contributors to this growth were significant year-over-year increases in iphone revenue, strong demand for ipad, and to a lesser extent strength in the japanese yen. mac net sales increased by 8% driven by a 22%
increase in unit sales due primarily to strong demand for macbook pro and imac, partially offset by lower average selling prices in japan on a year-over-year basis. the japan segment represented 6% and 5% of the companys total net sales for
2010 and 2009, respectively.japans net sales increased $551 million or 32% in 2009 compared to 2008. the primary

portable systems increased during 2009 compared to 2008, driven primarily by stronger demand for macbook pro. net sales and unit sales of ipods increased during 2009 compared to 2008, driven by strong demand for ipod touch and ipod nano. the japan
segment represented approximately 5% of the companys total net sales in both 2009 and 2008.36



asia-pacificnet sales in asia-pacific increased $5.1 billion or 160% during 2010 compared to 2009. the significant growth in asia-pacific net sales
was due mainly to increased iphone revenue, which was primarily attributable to country and carrier expansion and continued growth from existing carriers. asia-pacific net sales were also favorably affected by strong demand for mac portable and
desktop systems and for ipad. particularly strong year-over-year growth was experienced in china, korea and australia. the asia-pacific segment represented 13% and 7% of the companys total net sales for 2010 and 2009, respectively.net sales in asia-pacific increased $493 million or 18% during 2009 compared to 2008 reflecting strong growth in sales of iphone and mac
portable systems, offset partially by a decline in sales of ipods and mac desktop systems, as well as a strengthening of the u.s. dollar against the australian dollar and other asian currencies. mac net sales and unit sales grew in the asia-pacific
region by 4% and 17%, respectively, due to increased sales of the macbook pro. the asia-pacific segment represented approximately 7% of the companys total net sales in both 2009 and 2008.retailretail net sales
increased $3.1 billion or 47% during 2010 compared to 2009. the increase in net sales was driven primarily by strong demand for ipad, increased sales of mac desktop and portable systems and a significant year-over-year increase in iphone revenue.
mac net sales and unit sales grew in the retail segment by 25% and 35%, respectively, during 2010. the company opened 44 new retail stores during the year, 28 of which were international stores, ending the year with 317 stores open compared to 273
stores at the end of 2009. with an average of 288 stores and 254 stores opened during 2010 and 2009, respectively, average revenue per store increased to $34.1 million in 2010, compared to $26.2 million in 2009. the retail segment represented 15%
and 16% of the companys total net sales in 2010 and 2009, respectively.retail net sales decreased $636 million or 9%
during 2009 compared to 2008. the decline in net sales was driven largely by a decrease in net sales of iphones, ipods and mac desktop systems, offset partially by strong demand for mac portable systems. the year-over-year decline in retail net
sales was attributable to continued third-party channel expansion, particularly in the u.s. where most of the companys stores are located, and also reflects the challenging consumer-spending environment in 2009. the company opened 26 new
retail stores during 2009, including 14 international stores, ending the year with 273 stores open. this compares to 247 stores open as of september 27, 2008. with an average of 254 stores and 211 stores opened during 2009 and 2008,
respectively, average revenue per store decreased to $26.2 million for 2009 from $34.6 million in 2008.the retail segment
reported operating income of $2.4 billion during 2010 and $1.7 billion during both 2009 and 2008. the increase in retail operating income during 2010 compared to 2009 was attributable to higher overall net sales. despite the decline in retail net
sales during 2009 compared to 2008, the retail segments operating income was flat at $1.7 billion in 2009 compared to 2008 due primarily to a higher gross margin percentage in 2009 consistent with that experienced by the overall company.expansion of the retail segment has required and will continue to require a substantial investment in fixed assets and
related infrastructure, operating lease commitments, personnel, and other operating expenses. capital asset purchases associated with the retail segment since its inception totaled $2.2 billion through the end of 2010. as of september 25, 2010,
the retail segment had approximately 26,500 full-time equivalent employees and had outstanding lease commitments associated with retail space and related facilities of $1.7 billion. the company would incur substantial costs if it were to close
multiple retail stores and such costs could adversely affect the companys financial condition and operating results.37

gross margingross margin for the three years ended september 25, 2010, are as follows (in millions, except gross margin percentages):net salescost of salesgross margingross margin percentagethe gross margin
percentage in 2010 was 39.4% compared to 40.1% in 2009. this decline in gross margin is primarily attributable to new products that have higher cost structures, including ipad, partially offset by a more favorable sales mix of iphone, which has a
higher gross margin than the company average.the gross margin percentage in 2009 was 40.1% compared to 35.2% in 2008. the
primary contributors to the increase in 2009 as compared to 2008 were a favorable sales mix toward products with higher gross margins and lower commodity and other product costs, which were partially offset by product price reductions.the company expects its gross margin percentage to decrease in future periods compared to levels achieved during 2010 and anticipates
gross margin levels of about 36% in the first quarter of 2011. this expected decline is largely due to a higher mix of new and innovative products that have higher cost structures and deliver greater value to customers, and expected and potential
future component cost and other cost increases.the foregoing statements regarding the companys expected gross margin
percentage are forward-looking and could differ from anticipated levels because of several factors, including but not limited to certain of those set forth below in part i, item 1a, risk factors under the subheading future
operating results depend upon the companys ability to obtain key components including but not limited to microprocessors, nand flash memory, dram and lcds at favorable prices and in sufficient quantities, which is incorporated herein
by reference. there can be no assurance that targeted gross margin percentage levels will be achieved. in general, gross margins and margins on individual products will remain under downward pressure due to a variety of factors, including continued
industry wide global product pricing pressures, increased competition, compressed product life cycles, product transitions and expected and potential increases in the cost of key components including but not limited to microprocessors, nand flash
memory, dram and lcds, as well as potential increases in the costs of outside manufacturing services and a potential shift in the companys sales mix towards products with lower gross margins. in response to these competitive pressures, the
company expects it will continue to take product pricing actions, which would adversely affect gross margins. gross margins could also be affected by the companys ability to manage product quality and warranty costs effectively and to
stimulate demand for certain of its products. due to the companys significant international operations, financial results can be significantly affected in the short-term by fluctuations in exchange rates.operating expensesoperating expenses for the three years ended september 25, 2010, are as follows (in millions, except for percentages):research and developmentpercentage of net salesselling, general and administrativepercentage of net sales38

research and development expense
(r&d)r&d expense increased 34% or $449 million to $1.8 billion in 2010 compared to 2009. this
increase was due primarily to an increase in headcount and related expenses in the current year to support expanded r&d activities. also contributing to this increase in r&d expense in 2010 was the capitalization in 2009 of software
development costs of $71 million related to mac os x snow leopard. although total r&d expense increased 34% during 2010, it declined as a percentage of net sales given the 52% year-over-year increase in net sales in 2010. the company continues
to believe that focused investments in r&d are critical to its future growth and competitive position in the marketplace and are directly related to timely development of new and enhanced products that are central to the companys core
business strategy. as such, the company expects to make further investments in r&d to remain competitive.r&d expense
increased 20% or $224 million to $1.3 billion in 2009 compared to 2008. this increase was due primarily to an increase in headcount in 2009 to support expanded r&d activities and higher stock-based compensation expenses. additionally, $71
million of software development costs were capitalized related to mac os x snow leopard and excluded from r&d expense during 2009, compared to $11 million of software development costs capitalized during 2008. although total r&d expense
increased 20% during 2009, it remained relatively flat as a percentage of net sales given the 14% increase in revenue in 2009.selling,
general and administrative expense (sg&a)sg&a expense increased $1.4 billion or 33% to $5.5 billion
in 2010 compared to 2009. this increase was due primarily to the companys continued expansion of its retail segment, higher spending on marketing and advertising programs, increased stock-based compensation expenses and variable costs
associated with the overall growth of the companys net sales.sg&a expenses increased $388 million or 10% to $4.1
billion in 2009 compared to 2008. this increase was due primarily to the companys continued expansion of its retail segment in both domestic and international markets, higher stock-based compensation expense and higher spending on marketing
and advertising.other income and expenseother income and expense for the three years ended september 25, 2010, are as follows (in millions):interest incomeother income (expense), nettotal other income and expensetotal other income and expense decreased $171 million or 52% to $155 million during 2010 compared to $326
million and $620 million in 2009 and 2008, respectively. the overall decrease in other income and expense is attributable to the significant declines in interest rates on a year-over-year basis, partially offset by the companys higher cash,
cash equivalents and marketable securities balances. the weighted average interest rate earned by the company on its cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities was 0.75%, 1.43% and 3.44% during 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. additionally
the company incurred higher premium expenses on its foreign exchange option contracts, which further reduced the total other income and expense. during 2010, 2009 and 2008, the company had no debt outstanding and accordingly did not incur any
related interest expense.provision for income taxesthe companys effective tax rates were 24%, 32% and 32% for 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. the companys effective rates for these periods differ from the statutory federal income tax rate

rate in 2010 as compared to 2009 is due primarily to an increase in foreign earnings on which u.s. income taxes have not been provided as such earnings are intended to be indefinitely reinvested outside the u.s.as of september 25, 2010, the company had deferred tax assets arising from deductible temporary differences, tax losses, and tax
credits of $2.4 billion, and deferred tax liabilities of $5.0 billion. management believes it is more likely than not that forecasted income, including income that may be generated as a result of certain tax planning strategies, together with future
reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, will be sufficient to fully recover the deferred tax assets. the company will continue to evaluate the realizability of deferred tax assets quarterly by assessing the need for and amount of a
valuation allowance.the internal revenue service (the irs) has completed its field audit of the companys
federal income tax returns for the years 2004 through 2006 and proposed certain adjustments. the company has contested certain of these adjustments through the irs appeals office. the irs is currently examining the years 2007 through 2009. all irs
audit issues for years prior to 2004 have been resolved. during the third quarter of 2010, the company reached a tax settlement with the irs for the years 2002 through 2003. in addition, the company is subject to audits by state, local, and foreign
tax authorities. management believes that adequate provision has been made for any adjustments that may result from tax examinations. however, the outcome of tax audits cannot be predicted with certainty. if any issues addressed in the
companys tax audits are resolved in a manner not consistent with managements expectations, the company could be required to adjust its provision for income taxes in the period such resolution occurs.liquidity and capital resourcesthe following table presents selected financial information and statistics as of and for the three years ended september 25, 2010 (in millions):cash, cash equivalents and marketable securitiesaccounts receivable, netinventoriesworking capitalannual operating cash flowas of
september 25, 2010, the company had $51 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, an increase of $17 billion from september 26, 2009. the principal component of this net increase was the cash generated by operating
activities of $18.6 billion, which was partially offset by payments for acquisition of property, plant and equipment of $2 billion and payments made in connection with business acquisitions, net of cash acquired, of $638 million.the companys marketable securities investment portfolio is invested primarily in highly rated securities, generally with a minimum
rating of single-a or equivalent. as of september 25, 2010 and september 26, 2009, $30.8 billion and $17.4 billion, respectively, of the companys cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities were held by foreign subsidiaries and
are generally based in u.s. dollar-denominated holdings. the company believes its existing balances of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities will be sufficient to satisfy its working capital needs, capital asset purchases, outstanding
commitments and other liquidity requirements associated with its existing operations over the next 12 months.40

capital assetsthe companys capital expenditures were $2.6 billion during 2010, consisting of approximately $404 million for retail store
facilities and $2.2 billion for other capital expenditures, including product tooling and manufacturing process equipment and corporate facilities and infrastructure. the companys actual cash payments for capital expenditures during 2010 were
$2 billion.the company anticipates utilizing approximately $4.0 billion for capital expenditures during 2011, including
approximately $600 million for retail store facilities and approximately $3.4 billion for product tooling and manufacturing process equipment, and corporate facilities and infrastructure, including information systems hardware, software and
enhancements.historically the company has opened between 25 and 50 new retail stores per year. during 2011, the company
expects to open 40 to 50 new stores, over half of which are expected to be located outside of the u.s.off-balance sheet arrangements and
contractual obligationsthe company has not entered into any transactions with unconsolidated entities whereby the company
has financial guarantees, subordinated retained interests, derivative instruments, or other contingent arrangements that expose the company to material continuing risks, contingent liabilities, or any other obligation under a variable interest in an
unconsolidated entity that provides financing, liquidity, market risk, or credit risk support to the company.the following
table presents certain payments due by the company under contractual obligations with minimum firm commitments as of september 25, 2010 and excludes amounts already recorded on the consolidated balance sheet (in millions):operating leasespurchase obligationsother obligationstotallease commitmentsas of september 25, 2010, the company had total outstanding commitments on noncancelable operating leases of $2.1 billion, $1.7 billion of which related to the lease of retail space and related
facilities. the companys major facility leases are typically for terms not exceeding 10 years and generally provide renewal options for terms not exceeding five additional years. leases for retail space are for terms ranging from five to 20
years, the majority of which are for ten years, and often contain multi-year renewal options.purchase commitments with contract
manufacturers and component suppliersthe company utilizes several contract manufacturers to manufacture sub-assemblies
for the companys products and to perform final assembly and test of finished products. these contract manufacturers acquire components and build product based on demand information supplied by the company, which typically covers periods
ranging from 30 to 150 days. the company also obtains individual components for its products from a wide variety of individual suppliers. consistent with industry practice, the company acquires components through a combination of purchase orders,
supplier contracts, and open orders based on projected demand information.41


## Item 7A


movements in either foreign exchange or interest rates. in addition, the timing of the accounting for recognition of gains and losses related to mark-to-market instruments for any given period
may not coincide with the timing of gains and losses related to the underlying economic exposures and, therefore, may adversely affect the companys financial condition and operating results.interest rate riskwhile the company is exposed to interest rate fluctuations in many of the worlds leading industrialized countries, the
companys interest income and expense is most sensitive to fluctuations in the general level of u.s. interest rates. as such, changes in u.s. interest rates affect the interest earned on the companys cash, cash equivalents and marketable
securities, the fair value of those investments, as well as costs associated with foreign currency hedges.the companys
investment policy and strategy are focused on preservation of capital and supporting the liquidity requirements of the company. a portion of the companys cash is managed by external managers within the guidelines of the companys
investment policy and to objective market benchmarks. the companys internal portfolio is benchmarked against external manager performance.the companys exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the companys investment portfolio. the company typically invests in highly rated securities and its
policy generally limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. the companys investment policy requires investments to be investment grade, primarily rated single-a or better, with the objective of minimizing the potential risk of
principal loss. all highly liquid investments with initial maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase are classified as cash equivalents. the company classifies its marketable securities as either short-term or long-term based on
each instruments underlying contractual maturity date. all short-term marketable securities have maturities less than 12 months, while all long-term marketable securities have maturities ranging from one to five years. the company may sell its
investments prior to their stated maturities for strategic purposes, in anticipation of credit deterioration, or for duration management. the company recognized no significant net gains or losses during 2010, 2009 and 2008 related to such sales.to provide a meaningful assessment of the interest rate risk associated with the companys investment portfolio, the
company performed a sensitivity analysis to determine the impact a change in interest rates would have on the value of the investment portfolio assuming a 100 basis point parallel shift in the yield curve. based on investment positions as of
september 25, 2010, a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates across all maturities would result in a $477 million incremental decline in the fair market value of the portfolio. as of september 26, 2009, a similar 100 basis
point shift in the yield curve would have resulted in a $176 million incremental decline in the fair market value of the portfolio. such losses would only be realized if the company sold the investments prior to maturity.foreign currency riskin general, the company is a net receiver of currencies other than the u.s. dollar. accordingly, changes in exchange rates, and in
particular a strengthening of the u.s. dollar, will negatively affect the companys net sales and gross margins as expressed in u.s. dollars. there is also a risk that the company will have to adjust local currency product pricing due to
competitive pressures when there has been significant volatility in foreign currency exchange rates.the company may enter
into foreign currency forward and option contracts with financial institutions to protect against foreign exchange risks associated with certain existing assets and liabilities, certain firmly committed transactions, forecasted future cash flows,
and net investments in foreign subsidiaries. generally, the companys practice is to hedge a majority of its material foreign exchange exposures, typically for three to six months.43



however, the company may choose not to hedge certain foreign exchange exposures for a variety of reasons, including but not limited to immateriality, accounting considerations and the prohibitive
economic cost of hedging particular exposures.to provide a meaningful assessment of the foreign currency risk associated
with certain of the companys foreign currency derivative positions, the company performed a sensitivity analysis using a value-at-risk (var) model to assess the potential impact of fluctuations in exchange rates. the var model
consisted of using a monte carlo simulation to generate thousands of random market price paths. the var is the maximum expected loss in fair value, for a given confidence interval, to the companys foreign exchange portfolio due to adverse
movements in rates. the var model is not intended to represent actual losses but is used as a risk estimation and management tool. the model assumes normal market conditions. forecasted transactions, firm commitments, and assets and liabilities
denominated in foreign currencies were excluded from the model. based on the results of the model, the company estimates with 95% confidence a maximum one-day loss in fair value of $103 million as of september 25, 2010 compared to a maximum
one-day loss in fair value of $44 million as of september 26, 2009. because the company uses foreign currency instruments for hedging purposes, losses incurred on those instruments are generally offset by increases in the fair value of the
underlying exposures.actual future gains and losses associated with the companys investment portfolio and derivative
positions may differ materially from the sensitivity analyses performed as of september 25, 2010 due to the inherent limitations associated with predicting the changes in the timing and amount of interest rates, foreign currency exchanges rates
and the companys actual exposures and positions.44

notes to consolidated financial statementsnote 1  summary of significant accounting policiesapple inc.
and its wholly-owned subsidiaries (collectively apple or the company) designs, manufactures, and markets personal computers, mobile communication and media devices, and portable digital music players, and sells a variety of
related software, services, peripherals, networking solutions, and third-party digital content and applications. the company sells its products worldwide through its retail stores, online stores, and direct sales force, and third-party cellular
network carriers, wholesalers, resellers and value-added resellers. in addition, the company sells a variety of third-party macintosh (mac), iphone, ipad and ipod compatible products including application software, printers, storage
devices, speakers, headphones, and various other accessories and supplies through its online and retail stores. the company sells to consumer, small and mid-sized business, education, enterprise, government and creative customers.basis of presentation and preparationthe accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the company. intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. the preparation of these consolidated financial
statements in conformity with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles (gaap) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in these consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes.
actual results could differ materially from those estimates. certain prior year amounts in the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto have been reclassified to conform to the current years presentation.the companys fiscal year is the 52 or 53-week period that ends on the last saturday of september. the companys fiscal years
2010, 2009 and 2008 ended on september 25, 2010, september 26, 2009 and september 27, 2008, respectively, and included 52 weeks each. an additional week is included in the first fiscal quarter approximately every six years to
realign fiscal quarters with calendar quarters. unless otherwise stated, references to particular years or quarters refer to the companys fiscal years ended in september and the associated quarters of those fiscal years.retrospective adoption of new accounting principlesin september 2009, the financial accounting standards board (fasb) amended the accounting standards related to revenue recognition for arrangements with multiple deliverables and arrangements
that include software elements (new accounting principles). the new accounting principles permitted prospective or retrospective adoption, and the company elected retrospective adoption during the first quarter of 2010.under the historical accounting principles, the company was required to account for sales of both iphone and apple tv using subscription
accounting because the company indicated it might from time-to-time provide future unspecified software upgrades and features for those products free of charge. under subscription accounting, revenue and associated product cost of sales for iphone
and apple tv were deferred at the time of sale and recognized on a straight-line basis over each products estimated economic life. this resulted in the deferral of significant amounts of revenue and cost of sales related to iphone and apple
tv.the new accounting principles affect the companys accounting for all past and current sales of iphone, ipad, apple
tv and for sales of ipod touch beginning in june 2010. the new accounting principles require the company to account for the sale of these devices as two deliverables. the first deliverable is the hardware and software essential to the functionality
of the hardware device delivered at the time of sale, and the second deliverable is the right included with the purchase of these devices to receive on a when-and-if-available basis, future unspecified software upgrades and features relating to the
products essential software. the new accounting principles result in the recognition of a substantial portion of the revenue and all product costs from50



the sale of these devices at the time of their sale. additionally, the company is required to estimate a standalone selling price for the unspecified software upgrade rights included with the
sale of these devices and recognizes that amount ratably over the 24-month estimated life of the related hardware device.refer to the explanatory note and note 2, retrospective adoption of new accounting principles in the 2009 form
10-k for additional information on the impact of adoption of the new accounting principles, which sections are incorporated herein by reference.revenue recognitionnet sales consist primarily of revenue from the sale
of hardware, software, digital content and applications, peripherals, and service and support contracts. the company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the sales price is fixed or
determinable, and collection is probable. product is considered delivered to the customer once it has been shipped and title and risk of loss have been transferred. for most of the companys product sales, these criteria are met at the time the
product is shipped. for online sales to individuals, for some sales to education customers in the u.s., and for certain other sales, the company defers revenue until the customer receives the product because the company legally retains a portion of
the risk of loss on these sales during transit. the company recognizes revenue from the sale of hardware products (e.g., macs, iphones, ipads, ipods and peripherals), software bundled with hardware that is essential to the functionality of the
hardware, and third-party digital content sold on the itunes store in accordance with general revenue recognition accounting guidance. the company recognizes revenue in accordance with industry specific software accounting guidance for the following
types of sales transactions: (i) standalone sales of software products, (ii) sales of software upgrades and (iii) sales of software bundled with hardware not essential to the functionality of the hardware.the company sells software and peripheral products obtained from other companies. the company generally establishes its own pricing and
retains related inventory risk, is the primary obligor in sales transactions with its customers, and assumes the credit risk for amounts billed to its customers. accordingly, the company generally recognizes revenue for the sale of products obtained
from other companies based on the gross amount billed. for certain sales made through the itunes store, including sales of third-party software applications for the companys ios devices, the company is not the primary obligor to users of the
software, and third-party developers determine the selling price of their software. therefore, the company accounts for such sales on a net basis by recognizing only the commission it retains from each sale and including that commission in net sales
in the consolidated statements of operations. the portion of the sales price paid by users that is remitted by the company to third-party developers is not reflected in the companys consolidated statement of operations.the company records deferred revenue when it receives payments in advance of the delivery of products or the performance of services.
this includes amounts that have been deferred related to embedded unspecified and specified software upgrades rights. the company sells gift cards redeemable at its retail and online stores, and also sells gift cards redeemable on the itunes store
for the purchase of content and software. the company records deferred revenue upon the sale of the card, which is relieved upon redemption of the card by the customer. revenue from applecare service and support contracts is deferred and recognized
ratably over the service coverage periods. applecare service and support contracts typically include extended phone support, repair services, web-based support resources and diagnostic tools offered under the companys standard limited
warranty.the company records reductions to revenue for estimated commitments related to price protection and for customer
incentive programs, including reseller and end-user rebates, and other sales programs and volume-based incentives. the estimated cost of these programs is recognized in the period the company has sold the product and committed to a plan. the company
also records reductions to revenue for expected future product returns based on the companys historical experience. revenue is recorded net of taxes collected from customers that are remitted to governmental authorities, with the collected
taxes recorded as current liabilities until remitted to the relevant government authority.51



revenue recognition for
arrangements with multiple deliverablesfor multi-element arrangements that include tangible products that contain
software that is essential to the tangible products functionality and undelivered software elements that relate to the tangible products essential software, the company allocates revenue to all deliverables based on their relative
selling prices. in such circumstances, the company uses a hierarchy to determine the selling price to be used for allocating revenue to deliverables: (i) vendor-specific objective evidence of fair value (vsoe), (ii) third-party
evidence of selling price (tpe), and (iii) best estimate of the selling price (esp). vsoe generally exists only when the company sells the deliverable separately and is the price actually charged by the company for that
deliverable. esps reflect the companys best estimates of what the selling prices of elements would be if they were sold regularly on a stand-alone basis.as described in more detail below, for all past and current sales of iphone, ipad, apple tv and for sales of ipod touch beginning in june 2010, the company has indicated it may from time-to-time provide
future unspecified software upgrades and features free of charge to customers. the company has identified two deliverables in arrangements involving the sale of these devices. the first deliverable is the hardware and software essential to the
functionality of the hardware device delivered at the time of sale. the second deliverable is the embedded right included with the purchase of iphone, ipad, ipod touch and apple tv to receive on a when-and-if-available basis, future unspecified
software upgrades and features relating to the products essential software. the company has allocated revenue between these two deliverables using the relative selling price method. because the company has neither vsoe nor tpe for the two
deliverables, the allocation of revenue has been based on the companys esps. amounts allocated to the delivered hardware and the related essential software are recognized at the time of sale provided the other conditions for revenue
recognition have been met. amounts allocated to the embedded unspecified software upgrade rights are deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis over the 24-month estimated life of each of these devices. all product cost of sales, including
estimated warranty costs, are recognized at the time of sale. costs for engineering and sales and marketing are expensed as incurred.the companys process for determining its esp for deliverables without vsoe or tpe considers multiple factors that may vary depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each
deliverable. the company believes its customers, particularly consumers, would be reluctant to buy unspecified software upgrade rights related to iphone, ipad, ipod touch and apple tv. this view is primarily based on the fact that unspecified
upgrade rights do not obligate the company to provide upgrades at a particular time or at all, and do not specify to customers which upgrades or features will be delivered. therefore, the company has concluded that if it were to sell upgrade rights
on a standalone basis, including those rights associated with iphone, ipad, ipod touch and apple tv, the selling price would be relatively low. key factors considered by the company in developing the esps for these upgrade rights include prices
charged by the company for similar offerings, the companys historical pricing practices, the nature of the upgrade rights (e.g., unspecified and when-and-if-available), and the relative esp of the upgrade rights as compared to the total
selling price of the product. the company may also consider, when appropriate, the impact of other products and services, including advertising services, on selling price assumptions when developing and reviewing its esps for software upgrade rights
and related deliverables. the company may also consider additional factors as appropriate, including the pricing of competitive alternatives if they exist, and product-specific business objectives.beginning in the third quarter of 2010 in conjunction with the announcement of ios 4, the companys esps for the embedded software
upgrade rights included with iphone, ipad and ipod touch reflect the positive financial impact expected by the company as a result of its introduction of a mobile advertising platform for these devices and the expectation of customers regarding
software that includes or supports an advertising component. ios 4 supports iad, the companys new mobile advertising platform, which enables applications on iphone, ipad and ipod touch to embed media-rich advertisements.for all periods presented, the companys esp for the embedded software upgrade right included with each apple tv sold is $10. the
companys esp for the software upgrade right included with each iphone sold through the52



companys second quarter of 2010 was $25. beginning in april 2010 in conjunction with the companys announcement of ios 4 for iphone, the company lowered its esp for the software
upgrade right included with each iphone to $10.beginning with initial sales of ipad in april 2010, the company has also
indicated it may from time-to-time provide future unspecified software upgrades and features free of charge to ipad customers. the companys esp for the embedded software upgrade right included with the sale of each ipad is $10. in june 2010,
the company announced that certain previously sold ipod touch models would receive an upgrade to ios 4 free of charge and indicated ipod touch devices running on ios 4 may from time-to-time receive future unspecified software upgrades and features
free of charge. the companys esp for the embedded software upgrade right included with each ipod touch sold beginning in june 2010 is $5.the company accounts for multiple element arrangements that consist only of software or software-related products, including the sale of upgrades to previously sold software, in accordance with industry
specific accounting guidance for software and software-related transactions. for such transactions, revenue on arrangements that include multiple elements is allocated to each element based on the relative fair value of each element, and fair value
is determined by vsoe. if the company cannot objectively determine the fair value of any undelivered element included in such multiple-element arrangements, the company defers revenue until all elements are delivered and services have been
performed, or until fair value can objectively be determined for any remaining undelivered elements. when the fair value of a delivered element has not been established, but fair value exists for the undelivered elements, the company uses the
residual method to recognize revenue. under the residual method, the fair value of the undelivered elements is deferred and the remaining portion of the arrangement fee is allocated to the delivered elements and is recognized as revenue.except as described for iphone, ipad, ipod touch and apple tv, the company generally does not offer unspecified upgrade rights to its
customers in connection with software sales or the sale of applecare extended warranty and support contracts. a limited number of the companys software products are available with maintenance agreements that grant customers rights to
unspecified future upgrades over the maintenance term on a when and if available basis. revenue associated with such maintenance is recognized ratably over the maintenance term.shipping costsfor all periods presented, amounts billed to customers
related to shipping and handling are classified as revenue, and the companys shipping and handling costs are included in cost of sales.warranty expensethe
company generally provides for the estimated cost of hardware and software warranties at the time the related revenue is recognized. the company assesses the adequacy of its pre-existing warranty liabilities and adjusts the amounts as necessary
based on actual experience and changes in future estimates.software development costsresearch and development costs are expensed as incurred. development costs of computer software to be sold, leased, or otherwise marketed
are subject to capitalization beginning when a products technological feasibility has been established and ending when a product is available for general release to customers. in most instances, the companys products are released soon
after technological feasibility has been established. therefore, costs incurred subsequent to achievement of technological feasibility are usually not significant, and generally most software development costs have been expensed as incurred.the company did not capitalize any software development costs during 2010. in 2009 and 2008, the company capitalized $71
million and $11 million, respectively, of costs associated with the development of mac os x53



version 10.6 snow leopard (mac os x snow leopard), which was released during the fourth quarter of 2009. the capitalized costs are being amortized to cost of sales on a straight-line
basis over a three year estimated useful life of the underlying technology.total amortization related to capitalized software
development costs was $48 million, $25 million and $27 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.advertising costsadvertising costs are expensed as incurred. advertising expense was $691 million, $501 million and $486 million for 2010, 2009 and 2008,
respectively.stock-based compensationthe company accounts for stock-based payment transactions in which the company receives employee services in exchange for (a) equity instruments of the enterprise or (b) liabilities that are
based on the fair value of the enterprises equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of such equity instruments. stock-based compensation cost for restricted stock units (rsus) is measured based on the closing fair
market value of the companys common stock on the date of grant. stock-based compensation cost for stock options is estimated at the grant date based on each options fair-value as calculated by the black-scholes-merton (bsm)
option-pricing model. the company recognizes stock-based compensation cost as expense ratably on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. the company will recognize a benefit from stock-based compensation in equity if an incremental
tax benefit is realized by following the ordering provisions of the tax law. in addition, the company accounts for the indirect effects of stock-based compensation on the research tax credit, the foreign tax credit and the domestic manufacturing
deduction through the income statement. further information regarding stock-based compensation can be found in note 7, shareholders equity and stock-based compensation of this form 10-k.income taxesthe
provision for income taxes is computed using the asset and liability method, under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax
bases of assets and liabilities, and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in effect for the years in which those tax
assets are expected to be realized or settled. the company records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is believed more likely than not to be realized.the company recognizes the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not the tax position will be
sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50%
likelihood of being realized upon settlement. see note 6, income taxes of this form 10-k for additional information.earnings
per common sharebasic earnings per common share is computed by dividing income available to common shareholders by the
weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. diluted earnings per common share is computed by dividing income available to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding
during the period increased to include the number of additional shares of common stock that would have been outstanding if the potentially dilutive securities had been issued.54

potentially dilutive securities include outstanding stock options, shares to be purchased under the employee stock purchase plan and unvested rsus. the dilutive effect of potentially dilutive
securities is reflected in diluted earnings per common share by application of the treasury stock method. under the treasury stock method, an increase in the fair market value of the companys common stock can result in a greater dilutive
effect from potentially dilutive securities.the following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted earnings per
common share for the three years ended september 25, 2010 (in thousands, except net income in millions and per share amounts):numerator:net incomedenominator:weighted-average shares outstandingeffect of dilutive securitiesweighted-average diluted sharesbasic earnings per common sharediluted earnings per common sharepotentially dilutive
securities representing 1.6 million, 12.6 million and 10.3 million shares of common stock for 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively, were excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per common share for these periods because their
effect would have been antidilutive.financial instrumentscash equivalents and marketable securitiesall highly liquid investments
with maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase are classified as cash equivalents. the companys debt and marketable equity securities have been classified and accounted for as available-for-sale. management determines the
appropriate classification of its investments in debt securities at the time of purchase and reevaluates the available-for-sale designations as of each balance sheet date. the company classifies its marketable debt securities as either short-term or
long-term based on each instruments underlying contractual maturity date. marketable securities with maturities of less than 12 months are classified as short-term and marketable securities with maturities greater than 12 months are classified
as long-term. these securities are carried at fair value, with the unrealized gains and losses, net of taxes, reported as a component of shareholders equity. the cost of securities sold is based upon the specific identification method.derivative financial instrumentsthe company accounts for its derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities and carries them at fair value. derivatives that are not defined as hedges must be adjusted to fair value through
earnings.for derivative instruments that hedge the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows that are designated
as cash flow hedges, the effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative instrument is reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income in shareholders equity and reclassified into earnings in the same period or
periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. the ineffective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative instrument is recognized in current earnings. to receive hedge accounting treatment, cash flow hedges must be highly
effective in offsetting changes to expected future cash flows on hedged transactions. for options designated as cash flow hedges, changes in the time value are excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and are recognized in earnings. for
derivative instruments that hedge the exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset or a liability and that are designated as fair value hedges, the net gain or loss on the derivative instrument as well as the offsetting gain or loss on the
hedged item attributable to55



the hedged risk are recognized in earnings in the current period. the company did not have a net gain or loss on these derivative instruments during 2010, 2009 and 2008. the net gain or loss on
the effective portion of a derivative instrument that is designated as an economic hedge of the foreign currency translation exposure of the net investment in a foreign operation is reported in the same manner as a foreign currency translation
adjustment. for forward exchange contracts designated as net investment hedges, the company excludes changes in fair value relating to changes in the forward carry component from its definition of effectiveness. accordingly, any gains or losses
related to this component are recognized in current earnings.allowance for doubtful accountsthe company records its allowance for doubtful accounts based upon its assessment of various factors. the company considers historical
experience, the age of the accounts receivable balances, credit quality of the companys customers, current economic conditions, and other factors that may affect customers ability to pay.inventoriesinventories
are stated at the lower of cost, computed using the first-in, first-out method, or market. if the cost of the inventories exceeds their market value, provisions are made currently for the difference between the cost and the market value. the
companys inventories consist primarily of components and finished goods for all periods presented.property, plant and equipmentproperty, plant and equipment are stated at cost. depreciation is computed by use of the straight-line method over the
estimated useful lives of the assets, which for buildings is the lesser of 30 years or the remaining life of the underlying building, up to five years for equipment, and the shorter of lease terms or ten years for leasehold improvements. the company
capitalizes eligible costs to acquire or develop internal-use software that are incurred subsequent to the preliminary project stage. capitalized costs related to internal-use software are amortized using the straight-line method over the estimated
useful lives of the assets, which range from three to five years. depreciation and amortization expense on property and equipment was $815 million, $606 million and $387 million during 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.long-lived assets including goodwill and other acquired intangible assetsthe company reviews property, plant and equipment and certain identifiable intangibles, excluding goodwill, for impairment. long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. recoverability of these assets is measured by comparison of their carrying amounts to future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate. if property,
plant and equipment and certain identifiable intangibles are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized equals the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds its fair market value. the company did not record any
significant impairments during 2010, 2009 and 2008.the company does not amortize goodwill and intangible assets with
indefinite useful lives, rather such assets are required to be tested for impairment at least annually or sooner whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the assets may be impaired. the company performs its goodwill and intangible
asset impairment tests on or about august 31 of each year. the company did not recognize any goodwill or intangible asset impairment charges in 2010, 2009 and 2008. the company established reporting units based on its current reporting
structure. for purposes of testing goodwill for impairment, goodwill has been allocated to these reporting units to the extent it relates to each reporting unit.the company amortizes its intangible assets with definite lives over their estimated useful lives and reviews these assets for impairment. the company is currently amortizing its acquired intangible
assets with definite lives over periods ranging from three to ten years.56



fair value measurementsduring 2009, the company adopted the fasbs new accounting standard on fair value measurements and disclosures for
all financial assets and liabilities. the new accounting principles define fair value, provide a framework for measuring fair value, and expand the disclosures required for fair value measurements. during the first quarter of 2010, the company
adopted the new fair value accounting principles for all non-financial assets and non-financial liabilities, except for items that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis, which did not have a
material effect on the companys financial condition or operating results.the company applies fair value accounting for
all financial assets and liabilities and non-financial assets and liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis. the company defines fair value as the price that would be received from
selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. when determining the fair value measurements for assets and liabilities, which are required to be recorded at fair value,
the company considers the principal or most advantageous market in which the company would transact and the market-based risk measurements or assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, such as inherent risk,
transfer restrictions and credit risk. in accordance with the fair value accounting requirements, companies may choose to measure eligible financial instruments and certain other items at fair value. the company has not elected the fair value option
for any eligible financial instruments.foreign currency translation and remeasurementthe company translates the assets and liabilities of its non-u.s. dollar functional currency subsidiaries into u.s. dollars using exchange
rates in effect at the end of each period. revenue and expenses for these subsidiaries are translated using rates that approximate those in effect during the period. gains and losses from these translations are credited or charged to foreign
currency translation included in accumulated other comprehensive income in shareholders equity. the companys subsidiaries that use the u.s. dollar as their functional currency remeasure monetary assets and liabilities at exchange rates
in effect at the end of each period, and inventories, property, and nonmonetary assets and liabilities at historical rates. gains and losses from these remeasurements were insignificant and have been included in the companys results of
operations.segment informationthe company reports segment information based on the management approach. the management approach designates the internal reporting used by management for making decisions and assessing
performance as the source of the companys reportable segments. information about the companys products, major customers and geographic areas on a company-wide basis is also disclosed.business combinationsin december 2007, the fasb issued a new accounting standard for business combinations, which established principles and requirements for
how an acquirer is to recognize and measure in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree in a business combination. this new accounting standard also
established principles regarding how goodwill acquired in a business combination or a gain from a bargain purchase should be recognized and measured, requiring the capitalization of in-process research and development at fair value and the expensing
of acquisition-related costs as incurred, as well as providing guidelines on the disclosure requirements. in april 2009, the fasb amended this new accounting standard to require that assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination
that arise from contingencies be recognized at fair value, if the fair value can be determined during the measurement period. the company adopted the new business combination accounting standard in the first quarter of 2010 and applied these
principles to any business combinations completed in or after the first quarter of 2010. the adoption of the new business combination accounting standard did not have a material effect on the companys financial condition or operating results.57

marketable securities prior to their stated maturities for strategic purposes, in anticipation of credit deterioration, or for duration management. the company recognized no significant net realized gains or losses during 2010, 2009 and 2008 related
to such sales. the maturities of the companys long-term marketable securities generally range from one year to five years.59

the following tables

in a continuous loss position (in millions):certificates of deposit and time depositscorporate securitiesmunicipal securitiestotalcorporate securitiesthe company considers the declines in market value of its marketable securities investment portfolio to be
temporary in nature. the unrealized losses on the companys marketable securities were caused primarily by changes in market interest rates or widening credit spreads. the company typically invests in highly-rated securities, and its policy
generally limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. the companys investment policy requires investments to be investment grade, primarily rated single-a or better, with the objective of minimizing the potential risk of principal
loss. fair values were determined for each individual security in the investment portfolio. when evaluating the investments for other-than-temporary impairment, the company reviews factors such as the length of time and extent to which fair value
has been below cost basis, the financial condition of the issuer and any changes thereto, and the companys intent to sell, or whether it is more likely than not it will be required to sell, the investment before recovery of the
investments amortized cost basis. during the years ended september 25, 2010 and september 26, 2009, the company did not recognize any significant impairment charges. as of september 25, 2010, the company does not consider any of
its investments to be other-than-temporarily impaired.derivative financial instrumentsthe company uses derivatives to partially offset its business exposure to foreign currency exchange risk. the company may enter into
foreign currency forward and option contracts to offset some of the foreign exchange risk of expected future cash flows on certain forecasted revenue and cost of sales, of net investments in certain foreign subsidiaries, and on certain existing
assets and liabilities. to help protect gross margins from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, certain of the companys subsidiaries whose functional currency is the u.s. dollar, hedge a portion of forecasted foreign currency
revenue. the companys subsidiaries whose functional currency is not the u.s. dollar and who sell in local currencies, may hedge a portion of forecasted inventory purchases not denominated in the subsidiaries functional currencies. the
company typically hedges portions of its forecasted foreign currency exposure associated with revenue and inventory purchases for three to six months. to help protect the net investment in a foreign operation from adverse changes in foreign currency
exchange rates, the company may enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts to offset the changes in the carrying amounts of these investments due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. the company may also enter into
foreign currency forward and option contracts to partially offset the foreign currency exchange gains and losses generated by the re-measurement of certain assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies. however, the company may
choose not to hedge certain foreign currency exchange exposures for a variety of reasons, including but not limited to immateriality, accounting considerations and the prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures. there can be no
assurance the hedges will offset more than a portion of the financial impact resulting from movements in foreign currency exchange rates.60

the companys
accounting policies for these instruments are based on whether the instruments are designated as hedge or non-hedge instruments. the company records all derivatives on the consolidated balance sheets at fair value. the effective portions of cash
flow hedges are recorded in other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings. the effective portions of net investment hedges are recorded in other comprehensive income as a part of the cumulative translation adjustment.
derivatives that are not designated as hedging instruments and the ineffective portions of cash flow hedges and net investment hedges are adjusted to fair value through earnings in other income and expense.the company had a net deferred loss associated with cash flow hedges of approximately $252 million and a net deferred gain of $1 million,
net of taxes, recorded in other comprehensive income as of september 25, 2010 and september 26, 2009, respectively. other comprehensive income associated with cash flow hedges of foreign currency revenue is recognized as a component of net
sales in the same period as the related revenue is recognized, and other comprehensive income related to cash flow hedges of inventory purchases is recognized as a component of cost of sales in the same period as the related costs are recognized.
substantially all of the companys hedged transactions as of september 25, 2010 are expected to occur within six months.derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges must be de-designated as hedges when it is probable the forecasted hedged transaction will not occur in the initially identified time period or within
a subsequent two month time period. deferred gains and losses in other comprehensive income associated with such derivative instruments are reclassified immediately into earnings through other income and expense. any subsequent changes in fair value
of such derivative instruments also are reflected in current earnings unless they are re-designated as hedges of other transactions. the company did not recognize any significant net gains or losses related to the loss of hedge designation on
discontinued cash flow hedges during 2010, 2009 and 2008.the company had an unrealized net loss on net investment hedges of
$9 million and $2 million, net of taxes, included in the cumulative translation adjustment account of accumulated other comprehensive income (aoci) as of september 25, 2010 and september 26, 2009, respectively. the ineffective
portions and amounts excluded from the effectiveness test of net investment hedges are recorded in current earnings in other income and expense.the company recognized in earnings a net loss of $123 million and $133 million on foreign currency forward and option contracts not designated as hedging instruments during the year ended
september 25, 2010 and september 26, 2009, respectively. these amounts represent the net gain or loss on the derivative contracts and do not include changes in the related exposures, which generally offset a portion of the gain or loss on
the derivative contracts.the following table shows the notional principal and credit risk amounts of the companys

principal amounts for derivative instruments provide one measure of the transaction volume outstanding and does not represent the amount of the companys exposure to credit or market loss. the credit risk amounts represent the companys
gross exposure to potential accounting loss on these transactions if all counterparties failed to perform according to the terms of the contract, based on then-current currency exchange rates at each respective date. the companys gross
exposure on these transactions may be further mitigated by61

reflects the notional principal and credit risk amounts of the companys foreign exchange instruments, it does not reflect the gains or losses associated with the exposures and transactions that the foreign exchange instruments are intended to
hedge. the amounts ultimately realized upon settlement of these financial instruments, together with the gains and losses on the underlying exposures, will depend on actual market conditions during the remaining life of the instruments.the company generally enters into master netting arrangements, which reduce credit risk by permitting net settlement of transactions with
the same counterparty. to further limit credit risk, the company generally enters into collateral security arrangements that provide for collateral to be received or posted when the net fair value of certain financial instruments fluctuate from
contractually established thresholds. the company presents its derivative assets and derivative liabilities at their gross fair values. as of september 25, 2010, the company has posted cash collateral related to the derivative instruments
under its collateral security arrangements of $445 million and recorded the offsetting balance as other current assets in the consolidated balance sheet. the company did not record any significant amounts of cash collateral related to the derivative
instruments under its master netting arrangements as of september 26, 2009. the company did not have any derivative instruments with credit risk-related contingent features that would require it to post additional collateral as of
september 25, 2010 or september 26, 2009.the estimates of fair value are based on applicable and commonly used
pricing models and prevailing financial market information as of september 25, 2010. refer to note 3, fair value measurements of this form 10-k, for additional information on the fair value measurements for all financial assets and

company distributes its products through third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers and value-added resellers and directly to certain education, consumer and enterprise customers. the company generally does not require collateral
from its customers; however, the company will require collateral in certain instances to limit credit risk. in addition, when possible, the company attempts to limit credit risk on trade receivables with credit insurance for certain customers in
latin america, europe, asia, and australia, or by requiring third-party financing, loans or leases to support credit exposure. these credit-financing arrangements are directly between the third-party financing company and the end customer. as such,
the company generally does not assume any recourse or credit risk sharing related to any of these arrangements. however, considerable trade receivables not covered by collateral, third-party financing arrangements, or credit insurance are
outstanding with the companys third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers and value-added resellers. trade receivables from two of the companys customers accounted for 15% and 12% of trade receivables as of
september 25, 2010 and one of the companys customers accounted for 16% of trade receivables as of september 26, 2009. the companys cellular network carriers accounted for 64% and 51% of trade receivables as of

2010 and two of the companys vendors accounted for 40% and 36%, respectively, of non-trade receivables as of september 26, 2009. the company does not reflect the sale of these components in net sales and does not recognize any profits on
these sales until the related products are sold by the company, at which time any profit is recognized as a reduction of cost of sales.63

note 3  fair value
measurementsthe company defines fair value as the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer
a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. when determining the fair value measurements for assets and liabilities, which are required to be recorded at fair value, the company considers the principal
or most advantageous market in which the company would transact and the market-based risk measurements or assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, such as inherent risk, transfer restrictions and credit risk.the company applies the following fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value into three
levels and bases the categorization within the hierarchy upon the lowest level of input that is available and significant to the fair value measurement:level 1  quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.level 2  observable inputs other than quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in inactive markets,
or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.level 3  inputs that are generally unobservable and typically reflect managements estimates of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability.the companys valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of money market funds and certain marketable equity
securities were derived from quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. the valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of all other financial instruments, all of which have counterparties with high credit ratings,
were valued based on quoted market prices or model driven valuations using significant inputs derived from or corroborated by observable market data.assets/liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basisthe

foreign subsidiaries that are intended to be indefinitely reinvested in operations outside the u.s. as of september 25, 2010, u.s. income taxes have not been provided on a cumulative total of $12.3 billion of such earnings. the amount of
unrecognized deferred tax liability related to these temporary differences is estimated to be approximately $4.0 billion.as
of september 25, 2010 and september 26, 2009, $30.8 billion and $17.4 billion, respectively, of the companys cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities were held by foreign subsidiaries and are generally based in u.s.
dollar-denominated holdings. amounts held by foreign subsidiaries are generally subject to u.s. income taxation on repatriation to the u.s.deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect the effects of tax losses, credits, and the future income tax effects of temporary differences between the consolidated financial statement carrying amounts of
existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and are measured using enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.68

income taxes payable have been reduced by the tax benefits from employee stock plan awards. for stock options, the company receives an income tax benefit calculated as the difference between the fair market value of the stock issued at the time of
the exercise and the option price, tax effected. for rsus, the company receives an income tax benefit upon the awards vesting equal to the tax effect of the underlying stocks fair market value. the company had net excess tax
benefits from employee stock plan awards of $742 million, $246 million and $770 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively, which were reflected as increases to common stock.uncertain tax positionstax positions are evaluated in a two-step process.
the company first determines whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination. if a tax position meets the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold it is then measured to determine the amount of benefit to
recognize in the financial statements. the tax position is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. the company classifies gross interest and penalties and unrecognized tax
benefits that are not expected to result in payment or receipt of cash within one year as non-current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets.as of september 25, 2010, the total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits was $943 million, of which $404 million, if recognized, would affect the companys effective tax rate. as of
september 26, 2009, the total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits was $971 million, of which $307 million, if recognized, would affect the companys effective tax rate.69

balance sheets. in 2010 and 2009, the company recognized an interest benefit of $43 million and interest expense of $64 million, respectively, in connection with tax matters.the company is subject to taxation and files income tax returns in the u.s. federal jurisdiction and in many state and foreign jurisdictions. for u.s. federal income tax purposes, all years prior to 2004
are closed. the internal revenue service (the irs) has completed its field audit of the companys federal income tax returns for the years 2004 through 2006 and proposed certain adjustments. the company has contested certain of
these adjustments through the irs appeals office. the irs is currently examining the years 2007 through 2009. during the third quarter of 2010, the company reached a tax settlement with the irs for the years 2002 through 2003. in connection with the
settlement, the company reduced its gross unrecognized tax benefits by $100 million and recognized a $52 million tax benefit in the third quarter of 2010. in addition, the company is also subject to audits by state, local and foreign tax
authorities. in major states and major foreign jurisdictions, the years subsequent to 1988 and 2001, respectively, generally remain open and could be subject to examination by the taxing authorities.management believes that an adequate provision has been made for any adjustments that may result from tax examinations. however, the
outcome of tax audits cannot be predicted with certainty. if any issues addressed in the companys tax audits are resolved in a manner not consistent with managements expectations, the company could be required to adjust its provision for

employees, including executive officers. the 2003 plan permits the granting of incentive stock options, nonstatutory stock options, rsus, stock appreciation rights, stock purchase rights and performance-based awards. options granted under the 2003
plan generally expire seven to ten years after the grant date and generally become exercisable over a period of four years, based on continued employment, with either annual, semi-annual or quarterly vesting. in general, rsus granted under the 2003
plan vest over two to four years, are subject to the employees continued employment and are paid upon vesting in shares of the companys common stock on a one-for-one basis. at the companys 2010 annual meeting of shareholders, the
2003 plan was amended to (i) increase the number of shares of the companys common stock that may be delivered pursuant to awards granted under the 2003 plan by an additional 36,000,000 shares and (ii) extend the companys
authority to grant awards under the 2003 plan intended to qualify as performance-based awards within the meaning of section 162(m) of the u.s. internal revenue code through the 2015 annual meeting of shareholders. as of
september 25, 2010, approximately 62.5 million shares were reserved for future issuance under the 2003 plan.71



1997 employee stock option planin august 1997, the companys board of directors approved the 1997 employee stock option plan (the 1997
plan), a non-shareholder approved plan for grants of stock options to employees who are not officers of the company. options granted under the 1997 plan generally expire seven to ten years after the grant date. all stock options granted under
the 1997 plan are fully vested. in october 2003, the company terminated the 1997 plan, and no new options can be granted from this plan.1997 director stock planin august 1997, the companys board of directors (the board) adopted a director stock option plan, which was
subsequently renamed the 1997 director stock plan (the director plan) and has been approved by shareholders. as amended, the director plan (i) permits the company to grant awards of rsus or stock options to the companys
non-employee directors, (ii) beginning february 25, 2010, provides for automatic initial grants of rsus upon a non-employee director joining the board and automatic annual grants of rsus at each annual meeting of shareholders, and
(iii) permits the board to prospectively change the relative mixture of stock options and rsus for the initial and annual award grants and the methodology for determining the number of shares of the companys common stock subject to these
grants without shareholder approval. each share issued with respect to rsus granted under the plan reduces the number of shares available for grant under the plan by two shares. the director plan expires november 9, 2019. as of september 25,
2010, approximately 199,000 shares were reserved for future issuance under the director plan.rule 10b5-1 trading plansduring the fourth quarter of 2010, executive officers timothy d. cook, peter oppenheimer, d. bruce sewell, philip w. schiller and bertrand
serlet had trading plans pursuant to rule 10b5-1(c)(1) of the securities exchange act of 1934, as amended (the exchange act). a trading plan is a written document that pre-establishes the amounts, prices and dates (or formula for
determining the amounts, prices and dates) of future purchases or sales of the companys stock including the exercise and sale of employee stock options and shares acquired pursuant to the companys employee stock purchase plan and upon
vesting of rsus.employee stock purchase planthe company has a shareholder approved employee stock purchase plan (the purchase plan), under which substantially all employees may purchase the companys common stock through payroll
deductions at a price equal to 85% of the lower of the fair market values of the stock as of the beginning and end of six-month offering periods. an employees payroll deductions under the purchase plan are limited to 10% of the employees
compensation and employees may not purchase more than $25,000 of stock for any calendar year. additionally, no more than 1,000,000 shares may be purchased in the aggregate in any one offering period. as of september 25, 2010,
approximately 3.8 million shares were reserved for future issuance under the purchase plan.employee savings planthe company has an employee savings plan (the savings plan) qualifying as a deferred salary arrangement under
section 401(k) of the internal revenue code. under the savings plan, participating u.s. employees may defer a portion of their pre-tax earnings, up to the irs annual contribution limit ($16,500 for calendar year 2010). the company matches 50%
to 100% of each employees contributions, depending on length of service, up to a maximum 6% of the employees eligible earnings. the companys matching contributions to the savings plan were $72 million, $59 million and $50 million
in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.72

2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. upon vesting, the rsus are generally net share-settled to cover the required withholding tax and the remaining amount is converted into an equivalent number of shares of common stock. the majority of rsus that
vested in 2010, 2009 and 2008, were net-share settled such that the company withheld shares with value equivalent to the employees minimum statutory obligation for the applicable income and other employment taxes, and remitted the cash to the
appropriate taxing authorities. the total shares withheld were approximately 1.8 million, 707,000 and 857,000 for 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively, and were based on the value of the rsus on their vesting date as determined by the
companys closing stock price. total payments for the employees tax obligations to the taxing authorities were $406 million, $82 million and $124 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively, and are reflected as a financing activity
within the consolidated statements of cash flows. these net-share settlements had the effect of share repurchases by the company as they reduced and retired the number of shares that would have otherwise been issued as a result of the vesting
and did not represent an expense to the company.73

stock-based compensationstock-based compensation cost for rsus is measured based on the closing fair market value of the companys common
stock on the date of grant. stock-based compensation cost for stock options and employee stock purchase plan rights (stock purchase rights) is estimated at the grant date and offering date, respectively, based on the fair-value as
calculated by the bsm option-pricing model. the bsm option-pricing model incorporates various assumptions including expected volatility, expected life and interest rates. the expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of the
companys common stock over the most recent period commensurate with the estimated expected life of the companys stock options and other relevant factors including implied volatility in market traded options on the companys common
stock. the company bases its expected life assumption on its historical experience and on the terms and conditions of the stock awards it grants to employees. the company recognizes stock-based compensation cost as expense ratably on a straight-line
basis over the requisite service period.the weighted-average assumptions used for stock options granted do not apply to
employee stock options assumed in conjunction with business acquisitions during the year ended september 25, 2010. the weighted-average fair value of stock options assumed during the year ended september 25, 2010 was $216.82. there were no
stock options assumed during 2009 and 2008. the weighted-average assumptions used for the three years ended september 25, 2010, and the resulting estimates of weighted-average fair value per share of options granted and of stock purchase rights

major facility leases are typically for terms not exceeding 10 years and generally provide renewal options for terms not exceeding five additional years. leases for retail space are for terms
ranging from five to 20 years, the majority of which are for ten years, and often contain multi-year renewal options. as of september 25, 2010, the companys total future minimum lease payments under noncancelable operating leases were
$2.1 billion, of which $1.7 billion related to leases for retail space.rent expense under all operating leases, including
both cancelable and noncancelable leases, was $271 million, $231 million and $207 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. future minimum lease payments under noncancelable operating leases having remaining terms in excess of one year as of

company also offers a 90-day basic warranty for its service parts used to repair the companys hardware products. the company provides currently for the estimated cost that may be incurred under its basic limited product warranties at the time
related revenue is recognized. factors considered in determining appropriate accruals for product warranty obligations include the size of the installed base of products subject to warranty protection, historical and projected warranty claim rates,
historical and projected cost-per-claim, and knowledge of specific product failures that are outside of the companys typical experience. the company assesses the adequacy of its pre-existing warranty liabilities and adjusts the amounts as
necessary based on actual experience and changes in future estimates.the company periodically provides updates to its
applications and system software to maintain the softwares compliance with published specifications. the estimated cost to develop such updates is accounted for as warranty costs that are recognized at the time related software revenue is
recognized. factors considered in determining appropriate accruals related to such updates include the number of units delivered, the number of updates expected to occur, and the historical cost and estimated future cost of the resources necessary
to develop these updates.the following table reconciles changes in the companys accrued warranty and related costs for

legal claims that the software infringes third-party intellectual property rights. other agreements entered into by76



the company sometimes include indemnification provisions under which the company could be subject to costs and/or damages in the event of an infringement claim against the company or an
indemnified third-party. however, the company has not been required to make any significant payments resulting from such an infringement claim asserted against it or an indemnified third-party and, in the opinion of management, does not have a
potential liability related to unresolved infringement claims subject to indemnification that would materially adversely affect its financial condition or operating results. therefore, the company did not record a liability for infringement costs as
of either september 25, 2010 or september 26, 2009.the company has entered into indemnification agreements with
its directors and executive officers. under these agreements, the company has agreed to indemnify such individuals to the fullest extent permitted by law against liabilities that arise by reason of their status as directors or officers and to
advance expenses incurred by such individuals in connection with related legal proceedings. it is not possible to determine the maximum potential amount of payments the company could be required to make under these agreements due to the limited
history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each claim. however, the company maintains directors and officers liability insurance coverage to reduce its exposure to such obligations, and payments made
under these agreements historically have not materially adversely affected the companys financial condition or operating results.concentrations in the available sources of supply of materials and productalthough most components essential to the companys business are generally available from multiple sources, certain key components
including but not limited to microprocessors, enclosures, certain liquid crystal displays (lcds), certain optical drives and application-specific integrated circuits (asics) are currently obtained by the company from single
or limited sources, which subjects the company to significant supply and pricing risks. many of these and other key components that are available from multiple sources including but not limited to nand flash memory, dynamic random access memory
(dram) and certain lcds, are subject at times to industry-wide shortages and significant commodity pricing fluctuations. in addition, the company has entered into certain agreements for the supply of key components including but not
limited to microprocessors, nand flash memory, dram and lcds at favorable pricing, but there is no guarantee that the company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar favorable terms, or at all, upon expiration or otherwise obtain
favorable pricing in the future. therefore, the company remains subject to significant risks of supply shortages and/or price increases that can materially adversely affect its financial condition and operating results.the company and other participants in the personal computer, and mobile communication and media device industries also compete for
various components with other industries that have experienced increased demand for their products. in addition, the company uses some custom components that are not common to the rest of these industries, and new products introduced by the company
often utilize custom components available from only one source. when a component or product uses new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers yields have matured or manufacturing capacity has increased. if the
companys supply of a key single-sourced component for a new or existing product were delayed or constrained, if such components were available only at significantly higher prices, or if a key manufacturing vendor delayed shipments of completed
products to the company, the companys financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected. the companys business and financial performance could also be adversely affected depending on the time required to
obtain sufficient quantities from the original source, or to identify and obtain sufficient quantities from an alternative source. continued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at all, may be affected if those suppliers decided
to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the companys requirements.substantially all of the companys macs, iphones, ipads, ipods, logic boards and other assembled products are now manufactured by
outsourcing partners, primarily in various parts of asia. a significant concentration of this outsourced manufacturing is currently performed by only a few outsourcing partners of the company, often in single locations. certain of these outsourcing
partners are the sole-sourced supplier of components and manufacturing outsourcing for many of the companys key products including but not limited to final assembly77



of substantially all of the companys macs, iphones, ipads and ipods. although the company works closely with its outsourcing partners on manufacturing schedules, the companys
operating results could be adversely affected if its outsourcing partners were unable to meet their production commitments. the companys purchase commitments typically cover its requirements for periods ranging from 30 to 150 days.long-term supply agreementsthe company has entered into prepaid long-term supply agreements to secure the supply of certain inventory components, which generally expire between 2011 and 2015. as of september 25, 2010, the
company had a total of $956 million of inventory component prepayments outstanding, of which $157 million is classified as other current assets and $799 million is classified as other assets in the consolidated balance sheets. in august 2010, the
company entered into a long-term supply agreement under which it has committed to prepay $500 million in 2011. the company had a total of $1.2 billion of inventory component prepayments outstanding as of september 26, 2009. these prepayments
will be applied to certain inventory component purchases made over the life of each respective agreement.contingenciesthe company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that have arisen in the ordinary course of business and have not been fully
adjudicated, which are discussed in part i, item 3 of this form 10-k under the heading legal proceedings. in the opinion of management, the company does not have a potential liability related to any current legal proceedings and
claims that would individually or in the aggregate materially adversely affect its financial condition or operating results. however, the results of legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty. if the company failed to prevail in any of
these legal matters or if several of these legal matters were resolved against the company in the same reporting period, the operating results of a particular reporting period could be materially adversely affected.on march 14, 2008, mirror worlds, llc filed an action against the company alleging that certain of its products infringed on
three patents covering technology used to display files. on october 1, 2010, a jury returned a verdict against the company, and awarded damages of $208 million per patent for each of the three patents asserted. the company is challenging
the verdict, believes it has valid defenses and has not recorded a loss contingency at this time.production and marketing of
products in certain states and countries may subject the company to environmental, product safety and other regulations including, in some instances, the requirement to provide customers the ability to return product at the end of its useful life,
and place responsibility for environmentally safe disposal or recycling with the company. such laws and regulations have been passed in several jurisdictions in which the company operates, including various countries within europe and asia and
certain states and provinces within north america. although the company does not anticipate any material adverse effects in the future based on the nature of its operations and the thrust of such laws, there is no assurance that such existing laws
or future laws will not materially adversely affect the companys financial condition or operating results.note 9 
segment information and geographic datathe company reports segment information based on the management
approach. the management approach designates the internal reporting used by management for making decisions and assessing performance as the source of the companys reportable segments.the company manages its business primarily on a geographic basis. accordingly, the company determined its operating and reporting
segments, which are generally based on the nature and location of its customers, to be the americas, europe, japan, asia-pacific and retail operations. the americas, europe, japan and asia-pacific reportable segment results do not include results of
the retail segment. the americas segment includes both north and south america. the europe segment includes european countries, as well as the middle east and78



africa. the asia-pacific segment includes australia and asia, but does not include japan. the retail segment operates apple retail stores in 11 countries, including the u.s. each reportable
operating segment provides similar hardware and software products and similar services. the accounting policies of the various segments are the same as those described in note 1, summary of significant accounting policies.the company evaluates the performance of its operating segments based on net sales and operating income. net sales for geographic
segments are generally based on the location of customers, while retail segment net sales are based on sales from the companys retail stores. operating income for each segment includes net sales to third parties, related cost of sales and
operating expenses directly attributable to the segment. advertising expenses are generally included in the geographic segment in which the expenditures are incurred. operating income for each segment excludes other income and expense and certain
expenses managed outside the operating segments. costs excluded from segment operating income include various corporate expenses, such as manufacturing costs and variances not included in standard costs, research and development, corporate marketing
expenses, stock-based compensation expense, income taxes, various nonrecurring charges, and other separately managed general and administrative costs. the company does not include intercompany transfers between segments for management reporting
purposes. segment assets exclude corporate assets, such as cash, short-term and long-term investments, manufacturing and corporate facilities, miscellaneous corporate infrastructure, goodwill and other acquired intangible assets. except for the
retail segment, capital asset purchases for long-lived assets are not reported to management by segment. cash payments for capital asset purchases by the retail segment were $392 million, $369 million and $389 million for 2010, 2009 and 2008,
respectively.the company has certain retail stores that have been designed and built to serve as high-profile venues to
promote brand awareness and serve as vehicles for corporate sales and marketing activities. because of their unique design elements, locations and size, these stores require substantially more investment than the companys more typical retail
stores. the company allocates certain operating expenses associated with its high-profile stores to corporate marketing expense to reflect the estimated company-wide benefit. the allocation of these operating costs to corporate expense is based on
the amount incurred for a high-profile store in excess of that incurred by a more typical company retail location. the company had opened a total of 15 high-profile stores as of september 25, 2010. amounts allocated to corporate expense
resulting from the operations of high-profile stores were $75 million, $65 million and $53 million for 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.79

established in internal control  integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission (the coso criteria). apple inc.s management is responsible for maintaining effective
internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying managements annual report on internal control over financial reporting. our
responsibility is to express an opinion on the companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.we conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board (united states). those standards
require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control
over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered
necessary in the circumstances. we believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.a companys
internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles. a companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions
and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that
receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. also, projections
of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.in our opinion, apple inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of
september 25, 2010, based on the coso criteria.we also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the public

none.evaluation of
disclosure controls and proceduresbased on an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of the
companys management, the companys principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that the companys disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the exchange act
were effective as of september 25, 2010 to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by the company in reports that it files or submits under the exchange act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported
within the time periods specified in the securities and exchange commission rules and forms and (ii) accumulated and communicated to the companys management, including its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as
appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.inherent limitations over internal controlsthe companys internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of
financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with gaap. the companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that:pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the
companys assets;provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with gaap, and
that the companys receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of the companys management and directors; andprovide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets
that could have a material effect on the financial statements.management, including the companys
chief executive officer and chief financial officer, does not expect that the companys internal controls will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. a control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable,
not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs.
because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of internal controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. also, any evaluation of the effectiveness of
controls in future periods are subject to the risk that those internal controls may become inadequate because of changes in business conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.managements annual report on internal control over financial reportingthe companys management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as

## Item 1A


changes in fair value of derivative instruments. increased volatility in the financial markets and overall economic uncertainty would increase the risk of the actual amounts realized in
the future on the companys financial instruments differing significantly from the fair values currently assigned to them.global markets for the companys products and services are highly competitive and subject to rapid technological change. if the company is unable to compete effectively in these markets, its
financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected.the companys products and services
compete in highly competitive global markets characterized by aggressive price cutting, with resulting downward pressure on gross margins, frequent introduction of new products, short product life cycles, evolving industry standards, continual
improvement in product price/performance characteristics, rapid adoption of technological and product advancements by competitors, and price sensitivity on the part of consumers.the companys ability to compete successfully depends heavily on its ability to ensure a continuing and timely introduction of
innovative new products and technologies to the marketplace. the company believes it is unique in that it designs and develops nearly the entire solution for its products, including the hardware, operating system, numerous software applications, and
related services. as a result, the company must make significant investments in research and development and as such, the company currently holds a significant number of patents and copyrights and has registered and/or has applied to register
numerous patents, trademarks and service marks. by contrast, many of the companys competitors seek to compete primarily through aggressive pricing and very low cost structures. if the company is unable to continue to develop and sell
innovative new products with attractive margins or if other companies infringe on the companys intellectual property, the companys ability to maintain a competitive advantage could be negatively affected and its financial condition and
operating results could be materially adversely affected.the company markets certain mobile communication and media devices
based on the ios mobile operating system and also markets related third-party digital content and applications. the company faces substantial competition in these markets from companies that have significant technical, marketing, distribution and
other resources, as well as established hardware, software and digital content supplier relationships. additionally, the company faces significant price competition as competitors reduce their selling prices and attempt to imitate the companys
product features and applications within their own products or, alternatively, collaborate with each other to offer solutions that are more competitive than those they currently offer. the company also competes with illegitimate ways to obtain
third-party digital content and applications. the company has entered the mobile communications and media device markets, and some of its competitors in these markets have greater experience, product breadth and distribution channels than the
company. because some current and potential competitors have substantial resources and/or experience and a lower cost structure, they may be able to provide such products and services at little or no profit or even at a loss. the company also
expects competition to intensify as competitors attempt to imitate the companys approach to providing these components seamlessly within their individual offerings or work collaboratively to offer integrated solutions. the companys
financial condition and operating results depend substantially on the companys ability to continually improve ios and ios devices in order to maintain their functional and design advantages.the company is the only authorized maker of hardware using mac os x, which has a minority market share in the personal computer market.
this market is dominated by computer makers using competing operating systems, most notably windows. in the market for personal computers and peripherals, the company faces a significant number of competitors, many of which have broader product
lines, lower priced products, and a larger installed customer base. consolidation in this market has resulted in larger and potentially stronger competitors. price competition has been particularly intense as competitors selling windows-based
personal computers have aggressively cut prices and lowered product margins. an increasing number of internet devices that include software applications and are smaller and simpler than traditional personal computers compete for market share with
the companys existing products. the companys financial condition and operating results depend substantially on its ability to continually improve the mac platform to maintain its functional and design advantages.10



there can be no assurance the company will be able to continue to provide products and
services that compete effectively.to remain competitive and stimulate customer demand, the company must successfully
manage frequent product introductions and transitions.due to the highly volatile and competitive nature of the industries
in which the company competes, the company must continually introduce new products, services and technologies, enhance existing products and services, and effectively stimulate customer demand for new and upgraded products. the success of new
product introductions depends on a number of factors including but not limited to timely and successful product development, market acceptance, the companys ability to manage the risks associated with new products and production ramp issues,
the availability of application software for new products, the effective management of purchase commitments and inventory levels in line with anticipated product demand, the availability of products in appropriate quantities and costs to meet
anticipated demand, and the risk that new products may have quality or other defects in the early stages of introduction. accordingly, the company cannot determine in advance the ultimate effect of new product introductions and transitions on its
financial condition and operating results.the company faces substantial inventory and other asset risk in addition to
purchase commitment cancellation risk.the company records a write-down for product and component inventories that have
become obsolete or exceed anticipated demand or net realizable value and accrues necessary cancellation fee reserves for orders of excess products and components. the company also reviews its long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or
changed circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. if the company determines that impairment has occurred, it records a write-down equal to the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds its fair
market value. although the company believes its provisions related to inventory, other assets and purchase commitments are currently adequate, no assurance can be given that the company will not incur additional related charges given the rapid and
unpredictable pace of product obsolescence in the industries in which the company competes. such charges could materially adversely affect the companys financial condition and operating results.the company must order components for its products and build inventory in advance of product announcements and shipments. consistent with
industry practice, components are normally acquired through a combination of purchase orders, supplier contracts, open orders and, where appropriate, inventory component prepayments, in each case based on projected demand. such purchase commitments
typically cover forecasted component and manufacturing requirements for periods up to 150 days. because the companys markets are volatile, competitive and subject to rapid technology and price changes, there is a risk the company will forecast
incorrectly and order or produce excess or insufficient amounts of components or products, or not fully utilize firm purchase commitments. the companys financial condition and operating results have been in the past and could be in the future
materially adversely affected by the companys ability to manage its inventory levels and respond to short-term shifts in customer demand patterns.future operating results depend upon the companys ability to obtain components in sufficient quantities.because the company currently obtains components from single or limited sources, the company is subject to significant supply and pricing risks. many components that are available from multiple sources
are at times subject to industry-wide shortages and significant commodity pricing fluctuations. the company has entered into various agreements for the supply of components; there can be no guarantee that the company will be able to extend or renew
these agreements on similar terms, or at all. the follow-on effects from the credit crisis on the companys suppliers, referred to in economic conditions could materially adversely affect the company above, also could
affect the companys ability to obtain components. therefore, the company remains subject to significant risks of supply shortages and price increases that could materially adversely affect the companys11



financial condition and operating results. the company expects to experience decreases in its gross margin percentage in future periods, as compared to levels achieved during 2011, largely due to
a higher mix of new and innovative products with flat or reduced pricing that have higher cost structures and deliver greater value to customers, and potential future component cost and other cost increases.the company and other participants in the mobile communication and media device, and personal computer industries compete for various
components with other industries that have experienced increased demand for their products. the company uses some custom components that are not common to the rest of these industries. the companys new products often utilize custom components
available from only one source. when a component or product uses new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers yields have matured or manufacturing capacity has increased. continued availability of these
components at acceptable prices, or at all, may be affected if those suppliers decided to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the companys requirements. if the supply of components for a
new or existing product were delayed or constrained, or if a key manufacturing vendor delayed shipments of completed products to the company, the companys financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected.the company depends on component and product manufacturing and logistical services provided by outsourcing partners, many
of whom are located outside of the u.s.substantially all of the companys manufacturing is performed in whole or in
part by a few outsourcing partners primarily located in asia. the company has also outsourced much of its transportation and logistics management. while these arrangements may lower operating costs, they also reduce the companys direct control
over production and distribution. it is uncertain what effect such diminished control will have on the quality or quantity of products or services, or the companys flexibility to respond to changing conditions. although arrangements with these
partners may contain provisions for warranty expense reimbursement, the company may remain responsible to the consumer for warranty service in the event of product defects. the company also relies on its partners to adhere to the companys
supplier code of conduct. any unanticipated product defect or warranty liability, whether pursuant to arrangements with outsourcing partners or otherwise, or material violations of the supplier code of conduct, could materially adversely affect the
companys reputation, financial condition and operating results.the supply and manufacture of many critical components
is performed by sole-sourced outsourcing partners in the u.s., asia and europe. single-sourced outsourcing partners in asia perform final assembly of substantially all of the companys hardware products. if manufacturing or logistics in these
locations is disrupted for any reason including, but not limited to, natural and man-made disasters, information technology system failures, military actions or economic, business, labor, environmental, public health, or political issues, the
companys financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected.the company relies on
third-party intellectual property and digital content, which may not be available to the company on commercially reasonable terms or at all.many of the companys products include third-party intellectual property, which requires licenses from those third parties. based on past experience and industry practice, the company believes such
licenses generally could be obtained on reasonable terms. there is however no assurance that the necessary licenses could be obtained on acceptable terms or at all. if the company is unable to obtain or renew critical licenses on reasonable terms,
its financial condition and operating results may be materially adversely affected.the company also contracts with third
parties to offer their digital content through the itunes store. the licensing arrangements with these third parties are short-term and do not guarantee the continuation or renewal of these arrangements on reasonable terms, if at all. some
third-party content providers currently or in the future may offer competing products and services, and could take action to make it more difficult or impossible for the12



company to license their content in the future. other content owners, providers or distributors may seek to limit the companys access to, or increase the cost of, such content. if the
company is unable to continue to offer a wide variety of content at reasonable prices with acceptable usage rules, or continue to expand its geographic reach, the companys financial condition and operating results may be materially adversely
affected.many third-party content providers require the company to provide digital rights management (drm) and
other security solutions. if these requirements change, the company may have to develop or license new technology to provide these solutions. there is no assurance the company will be able to develop or license such solutions at a reasonable cost
and in a timely manner. in addition, certain countries have passed or may propose legislation that would force the company to license its drm, which could lessen the protection of content and subject it to piracy and also could affect arrangements
with the companys content providers.the companys future results could be materially adversely affected if it
is found to have infringed on intellectual property rights.technology companies, including many of the companys
competitors, frequently enter into litigation based on allegations of patent infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. in addition, patent holding companies seek to monetize patents they have purchased or otherwise obtained.
as the company has grown, the intellectual property rights claims against it have increased and may continue to increase. in particular, the companys cellular enabled products compete with mobile communication and media device companies that
hold significant patent portfolios, and the number of patent claims against the company has significantly increased. the company is vigorously defending infringement actions in courts in a number of u.s. jurisdictions and before the u.s.
international trade commission, as well as internationally in europe and asia. the plaintiffs in these actions frequently seek injunctions and substantial damages.regardless of the scope or validity of such patents or the merits of any patent claims by potential or actual litigants, the company may have to engage in protracted litigation. if the company is
found to infringe one or more patents, it may be required to pay substantial damages. if there is a temporary or permanent injunction prohibiting the company from marketing or selling certain products or a successful claim of infringement against
the company requiring it to pay royalties to a third-party, its financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected, regardless of whether it can develop non-infringing technology.in certain cases, the company may consider the desirability of entering into licensing agreements, although no assurance can be given
that such licenses can be obtained on acceptable terms or that litigation will not occur. these licenses may also significantly increase the companys operating expenses.in managements opinion there is not at least a reasonable possibility the company may have incurred a material loss, or a material loss in excess of a recorded accrual, with respect to loss
contingencies, including matters related to infringement of intellectual property rights. however, the outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain. therefore, although management considers the likelihood of such an outcome to be remote, if one or
more of these legal matters were resolved against the company in the same reporting period for amounts in excess of managements expectations, the companys consolidated financial statements of a particular reporting period could be
materially adversely affected.the companys future performance depends in part on support from third-party software
developers.the company believes decisions by customers to purchase its hardware products depend in part on the
availability of third-party software applications and services. there is no assurance that third-party developers will continue to develop and maintain software applications and services for the companys products. if third-party software
applications and services cease to be developed and maintained for the companys products, customers may choose not to buy the companys products, which could materially adversely affect the companys financial condition and operating
results.13



with respect to its mac products, the company believes the availability of third-party
software applications and services depends in part on the developers perception and analysis of the relative benefits of developing, maintaining, and upgrading such software for the companys products compared to windows-based products.
this analysis may be based on factors such as the perceived strength of the company and its products, the anticipated revenue that may be generated, continued acceptance by customers of mac os x, and the costs of developing such applications and
services. if the companys minority share of the global personal computer market causes developers to question the companys prospects, developers could be less inclined to develop or upgrade software for the companys products and
more inclined to devote their resources to developing and upgrading software for the larger windows market.with respect to
ios devices, the company relies on the continued availability and development of compelling and innovative software applications, which are distributed through a single distribution channel, the app store. the absence of multiple distribution
channels, which are available for competing platforms, may limit the availability and acceptance of third-party applications by the companys customers, thereby causing developers to reduce or curtail development for the ios platform. in
addition, ios devices are subject to rapid technological change, and, if third-party developers are unable to or choose not to keep up with this pace of change, third-party applications might not successfully operate and may result in dissatisfied
customers. as with applications for the companys mac products, the availability and development of these applications also depend on developers perceptions and analysis of the relative benefits of developing software for the
companys products rather than its competitors products, including devices that use competing platforms. if developers focus their efforts on these competing platforms, the availability and quality of applications for the companys
devices may suffer.the companys future operating performance depends on the performance of distributors, carriers
and other resellers.the company distributes its products through wholesalers, resellers, national and regional retailers,
and value-added resellers, many of whom distribute products from competing manufacturers. the company also sells many of its products and third-party products in most of its major markets directly to education customers, cellular network
carriers distribution channels, resellers and consumers through its online and retail stores.carriers providing
cellular network service for iphone typically subsidize users purchase of the device. there is no assurance that such subsidies will be continued at all or in the same amounts upon renewal of the companys agreements with these carriers
or in agreements the company enters into with new carriers.many resellers have narrow operating margins and have been
negatively affected in the past by weak economic conditions. some resellers have perceived the expansion of the companys direct sales as conflicting with their business interests as distributors and resellers of the companys products.
such a perception could discourage resellers from investing resources in the distribution and sale of the companys products or lead them to limit or cease distribution of those products. the company has invested and will continue to invest in
programs to enhance reseller sales, including staffing selected resellers stores with company employees and contractors and improving product placement displays. these programs could require a substantial investment while providing no
assurance of return or incremental revenue. the companys financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected if the financial condition of these resellers weakens, if resellers stopped distributing the
companys products, or if uncertainty regarding demand for the companys products caused resellers to reduce their ordering and marketing of the companys products.14



the companys retail business has required and will continue to require a
substantial investment and commitment of resources and is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties.the companys
retail stores have required substantial fixed investment in equipment and leasehold improvements, information systems, inventory and personnel. the company also has entered into substantial operating lease commitments for retail space. certain
stores have been designed and built to serve as high-profile venues to promote brand awareness and serve as vehicles for corporate sales and marketing activities. because of their unique design elements, locations and size, these stores require
substantially more investment than the companys more typical retail stores. due to the high fixed cost structure associated with the retail segment, a decline in sales or the closure or poor performance of individual or multiple stores could
result in significant lease termination costs, write-offs of equipment and leasehold improvements, and severance costs that could materially adversely affect the companys financial condition and operating results.many factors unique to retail operations, some of which are beyond the companys control, pose risks and uncertainties that could
materially adversely affect the companys financial condition and operating results. these risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, macro-economic factors that could have a negative effect on general retail activity, as well as
the companys inability to manage costs associated with store construction and operation, inability to sell third-party products at adequate margins, failure to manage relationships with its existing retail channel partners, more challenging
environment in managing retail operations outside the u.s., costs associated with unanticipated fluctuations in the value of retail inventory, and inability to obtain and renew leases in quality retail locations at a reasonable cost.investment in new business strategies and initiatives could disrupt the companys ongoing business and present risks not
originally contemplated.the company has invested, and in the future may invest, in new business strategies or
acquisitions. such endeavors may involve significant risks and uncertainties, including distraction of management from current operations, insufficient revenue to offset liabilities assumed and expenses associated with the strategy, inadequate
return of capital, and unidentified issues not discovered in the companys due diligence. these new ventures are inherently risky and may not be successful. they may materially adversely affect the companys financial condition and
operating results.the companys products and services experience quality problems from time to time that can result
in decreased sales and operating margin.the company sells complex hardware and software products and services that can
contain design and manufacturing defects. sophisticated operating system software and applications, such as those sold by the company, often contain bugs that can unexpectedly interfere with the softwares intended operation. the
companys online services may from time to time experience outages, service slowdowns, or errors. defects may also occur in components and products the company purchases from third parties. there can be no assurance the company will be able to
detect and fix all defects in the hardware, software and services it sells. failure to do so could result in lost revenue, harm to reputation, and significant warranty and other expenses, and could have a material adverse impact on the
companys financial condition and operating results.the company is subject to laws and regulations worldwide,
changes to which could increase the companys costs and individually or in the aggregate materially adversely affect the companys financial condition or operating results.the company is subject to laws and regulations affecting its domestic and international operations in a number of areas. these u.s.
and foreign laws and regulations affect the companys activities including, but not limited to, areas of labor, advertising, content, consumer protection, real estate, billing, e-commerce, promotions, quality of services, telecommunications,
mobile, television, intellectual property ownership and infringement, tax,15



import and export requirements, anti-corruption, foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions, data privacy requirements, anti-competition, environmental, health, and safety.by way of example, laws and regulations related to mobile communications and media devices in the many jurisdictions in which
the company operates are extensive and subject to change. such changes could include, among others, restrictions on the production, manufacture, distribution, and use of the device, locking the device to a carriers network, or mandating the
use of the device on more than one carriers network. these devices are also subject to certification and regulation by governmental and standardization bodies, as well as by cellular network carriers for use on their networks. these
certification processes are extensive and time consuming, and could result in additional testing requirements, product modifications, delays in product shipment dates, or preclude the company from selling certain products.compliance with these laws, regulations and similar requirements may be onerous and expensive, and they may be inconsistent from
jurisdiction to jurisdiction, further increasing the cost of compliance. this increases the costs of doing business, and any such costs, which may rise in the future as a result of changes in these laws and regulations or in their
interpretation could individually or in the aggregate make the companys products and services less attractive to the companys customers, delay the introduction of new products in one or more regions, cause the company to change or limit
its business practices, or affect the companys financial condition and operating results. the company has implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these laws and regulations, but there can be no assurance that the
companys employees, contractors, or agents will not violate such laws and regulations or the companys policies. any such violations could individually or in the aggregate materially adversely affect the companys financial condition
or operating results.the companys success depends largely on the continued service and availability of key
personnel.much of the companys future success depends on the continued availability and service of key personnel,
including its ceo, its executive team and highly skilled employees. experienced personnel in the technology industry are in high demand and competition for their talents is intense, especially in the silicon valley, where most of the companys
key personnel are located.political events, war, terrorism, public health issues, natural disasters and other
circumstances could materially adversely affect the company.war, terrorism, geopolitical uncertainties, public health
issues, and other business interruptions have caused and could cause damage or disruption to international commerce and the global economy, and thus could have a strong negative effect on the company, its suppliers, logistics providers,
manufacturing vendors and customers, including channel partners. the companys business operations are subject to interruption by natural disasters, fire, power shortages, nuclear power plant accidents, terrorist attacks, and other hostile
acts, labor disputes, public health issues, and other events beyond its control. such events could decrease demand for the companys products, make it difficult or impossible for the company to make and deliver products to its customers,
including channel partners, or to receive components from its suppliers, and create delays and inefficiencies in the companys supply chain. should major public health issues, including pandemics, arise, the company could be negatively affected
by more stringent employee travel restrictions, additional limitations in freight services, governmental actions limiting the movement of products between regions, delays in production ramps of new products, and disruptions in the operations of the
companys manufacturing vendors and component suppliers. the majority of the companys research and development activities, its corporate headquarters, information technology systems, and other critical business operations, including
certain component suppliers and manufacturing vendors, are in locations that could be affected by natural disasters. in the event of a natural disaster, losses, significant recovery time and substantial expenditures could be required to resume
operations and the companys financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected.16

earthquake and tsunami and the recent flooding in thailand in part ii, item 7, managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations, under the subheading japan earthquake and tsunami
and thailand flooding, which is incorporated herein by reference.the company may be subject to information
technology system failures or network disruptions that could damage the companys reputation, business operations, and financial conditions.the company may be subject to information technology system failures and network disruptions. these may be caused by natural disasters, accidents, power disruptions, telecommunications failures, acts of
terrorism or war, computer viruses, physical or electronic break-ins, or similar events or disruptions. system redundancy may be ineffective or inadequate, and the companys disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all
eventualities. such failures or disruptions could prevent access to the companys online stores and services, preclude retail store transactions, compromise company or customer data, and result in delayed or cancelled orders. system failures
and disruptions could also impede the manufacturing and shipping of products, delivery of online services, transactions processing and financial reporting.the company may be subject to breaches of its information technology systems, which could damage the companys reputation, business partner and customer relationships, and access to online stores
and services. such breaches could subject the company to significant reputational, financial, legal, and operational consequences.the companys business requires it to use and store customer, employee, and business partner personally identifiable information (pii). this may include names, addresses, phone numbers,
email addresses, contact preferences, tax identification numbers, and payment account information. although malicious attacks to gain access to pii affect many companies across various industries, the company may be at a relatively greater risk of
being targeted because of its high profile and the amount of pii managed.the company requires user names and passwords in
order to access its information technology systems. the company also uses encryption and authentication technologies to secure the transmission and storage of data. these security measures may be compromised as a result of third-party security
breaches, employee error, malfeasance, faulty password management, or other irregularity, and result in persons obtaining unauthorized access to company data or accounts. third parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees or customers into
disclosing user names, passwords or other sensitive information, which may in turn be used to access the companys information technology systems. to help protect customers and the company, the company monitors accounts and systems for unusual
activity and may freeze accounts under suspicious circumstances, which may result in the delay or loss of customer orders.the company devotes significant resources to network security, data encryption, and other security measures to protect its systems and
data, but these security measures cannot provide absolute security. the company may experience a breach of its systems and may be unable to protect sensitive data. moreover, if a computer security breach affects the companys systems or results
in the unauthorized release of pii, the companys reputation and brand could be materially damaged and use of the companys products and services could decrease. the company would also be exposed to a risk of loss or litigation and
possible liability, which could result in a material adverse effect on the companys business, results of operations and financial condition.the companys business is subject to a variety of u.s. and international laws, rules, policies and other obligations regarding data protection.the company is subject to federal, state and international laws relating to the collection, use, retention, security and transfer of pii.
in many cases, these laws apply not only to third-party transactions, but also to transfers of information between the company and its subsidiaries, and among the company, its subsidiaries and other parties with which the company has commercial
relations. several jurisdictions have passed new laws in this17



area, and other jurisdictions are considering imposing additional restrictions. these laws continue to develop and may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. complying with emerging
and changing international requirements may cause the company to incur substantial costs or require the company to change its business practices. noncompliance could result in penalties or significant legal liability.the companys privacy policies and practices concerning the use and disclosure of data are posted on its website. any failure by the
company, its suppliers or other parties with whom the company does business to comply with its posted privacy policies or with other federal, state or international privacy-related or data protection laws and regulations could result in proceedings
against the company by governmental entities or others, which could have a material adverse effect on the companys business, results of operations and financial condition.the company is also subject to payment card association rules and obligations under its contracts with payment card processors. under
these rules and obligations, if information is compromised, the company could be liable to payment card issuers for the cost of associated expenses and penalties. in addition, if the company fails to follow payment card industry security standards,
even if no customer information is compromised, the company could incur significant fines or experience a significant increase in payment card transaction costs.the company expects its quarterly revenue and operating results to fluctuate.the companys profit margins vary among its products and its distribution channels. the companys software, accessories, and service and support contracts generally have higher gross margins
than certain of the companys other products. gross margins on the companys hardware products vary across product lines and can change over time as a result of product transitions, pricing and configuration changes, and component,
warranty, and other cost fluctuations. the companys direct sales generally have higher associated gross margins than its indirect sales through its channel partners. in addition, the companys gross margin and operating margin
percentages, as well as overall profitability, may be materially adversely impacted as a result of a shift in product, geographic or channel mix, new products, component cost increases, strengthening u.s. dollar, or price competition. the company
has typically experienced greater net sales in the first fiscal quarter compared to other fiscal quarters due to increased holiday seasonal demand. furthermore, the company sells more products from time-to-time during the third month of a quarter
than it does during either of the first two months. developments late in a quarter, such as lower-than-anticipated demand for the companys products, issues with new product introductions, an internal systems failure, or failure of one of the
companys logistics, components supply, or manufacturing partners, could have a material adverse impact on the companys financial condition and operating results.the companys stock price is subject to volatility.the
companys stock continues to experience substantial price volatility. additionally, the stock market as a whole has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected the stock price of many technology companies in ways that
may have been unrelated to these companies operating performance. the company believes its stock price reflects high future growth and profitability expectations. if the company fails to meet these expectations its stock price may
significantly decline, which could have a material adverse impact on investor confidence and employee retention.the
companys business is subject to the risks of international operations.the company derives a significant portion of
its revenue and earnings from its international operations. compliance with applicable u.s. and foreign laws and regulations, such as import and export requirements, anti-corruption laws, tax laws, foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation
restrictions, data privacy requirements, environmental laws, labor laws, and anti-competition regulations, increases the costs of doing business in foreign jurisdictions. although the company has implemented policies and procedures to comply with
these laws and18



regulations, a violation by the companys employees, contractors, or agents could nevertheless occur. the consequences of such violations could individually or in the aggregate materially
adversely affect the companys financial condition or operating results.the companys financial condition and
operating results also could be significantly affected by other risks associated with international activities including, but not limited to, economic and labor conditions, increased duties, taxes and other costs, political instability, and changes
in the value of the u.s. dollar versus local currencies. margins on sales of the companys products in foreign countries, and on sales of products that include components obtained from foreign suppliers, could be materially adversely affected
by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and by international trade regulations, including duties, tariffs and antidumping penalties. the company is also exposed to credit and collectability risk on its trade receivables with customers in
certain international markets. there can be no assurance it can effectively limit its credit risk and avoid losses, which could materially adversely affect the companys financial condition and operating results.the companys primary exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates relate to non-u.s. dollar denominated sales and
operating expenses worldwide. weakening of foreign currencies relative to the u.s. dollar will adversely affect the u.s. dollar value of the companys foreign currency-denominated sales and earnings, and generally will lead the company to raise
international pricing, potentially reducing demand for the companys products. in some circumstances, due to competition or other reasons, the company may decide not to raise local prices to the full extent of the dollars strengthening,
or at all, which would adversely affect the u.s. dollar value of the companys foreign currency denominated sales and earnings. conversely, a strengthening of foreign currencies, while generally beneficial to the companys foreign
currency-denominated sales and earnings, could cause the company to reduce international pricing and incur losses on its foreign currency derivative instruments, thereby limiting the benefit. additionally, strengthening of foreign currencies may
also increase the companys cost of product components denominated in those currencies, thus adversely affecting gross margins.the company has used derivative instruments, such as foreign currency forward and option contracts, to hedge certain exposures to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. the use of such hedging
activities may not offset any or more than a portion of the adverse financial effects of unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates over the limited time the hedges are in place.the company is exposed to credit risk and fluctuations in the market values of its investment portfolio.although the company has not recognized any significant losses to date on its cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, any
significant declines in their market values could materially adversely affect the companys financial condition and operating results. given the global nature of its business, the company has both domestic and international investments. credit
ratings and pricing of these investments can be negatively affected by liquidity, credit deterioration, financial results, economic risk, political risk, sovereign risk or other factors. as a result, the value and liquidity of the companys
cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities could decline and result in a significant impairment, which could materially adversely affect the companys financial condition and operating results.the company is exposed to credit risk on its trade accounts receivable, vendor non-trade receivables and prepayments related to
long-term supply agreements. this risk is heightened during periods when economic conditions worsen.the company
distributes its products through third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers and value-added resellers. a substantial majority of the companys outstanding trade receivables are not covered by collateral or credit insurance.
the companys exposure to credit and collectability risk on its trade receivables is higher in certain international markets and its ability to mitigate such risks may be limited. cellular network carriers accounted for a significant portion of
the companys trade receivables as of september 24, 2011. the19


## Item 6

## Item 7


the company uses a variety of direct and indirect distribution channels, such as its retail
stores, online stores, and direct sales force, and third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers, and value-added resellers. the company believes that sales of its innovative and differentiated products are enhanced by knowledgeable
salespersons who can convey the value of the hardware and software integration, and demonstrate the unique solutions that are available on its products. the company further believes providing direct contact with its targeted customers is an
effective way to demonstrate the advantages of its products over those of its competitors and providing a high-quality sales and after-sales support experience is critical to attracting new and retaining existing customers. to ensure a high-quality
buying experience for its products in which service and education are emphasized, the company continues to expand and improve its distribution capabilities by expanding the number of its own retail stores worldwide. additionally, the company has
invested in programs to enhance reseller sales by placing high quality apple fixtures, merchandising materials and other resources within selected third-party reseller locations. through the apple premium reseller program, certain third-party
resellers focus on the apple platform by providing a high level of integration and support services, and product expertise.japan
earthquake and tsunami and thailand floodingon march 11, 2011, the northeast coast of japan experienced a severe
earthquake followed by a tsunami, with continuing aftershocks. these geological events have caused significant damage in the region, including severe damage to nuclear power plants, and have impacted japans power and other infrastructure as
well as its economy. certain of the companys suppliers are located in japan, and certain of its other suppliers integrate components or use materials manufactured in japan in the production of its products. to the extent that component
production has been affected, the company has generally obtained alternative sources of supply or implemented other measures. the company does not currently believe these events will have a material impact on its operations in the first quarter of
2012 unless conditions worsen, including, but not limited to, power outages and expansion of evacuation zones around the nuclear power plants.beyond the first quarter of 2012, uncertainty exists with respect to the availability of electrical power, the damage to nuclear power plants and the impact to other infrastructure. thus, there is a risk
that the company could in the future experience delays or other constraints in obtaining key components and products and/or price increases related to such components and products that could materially adversely affect the companys financial
condition and operating results.in addition, in recent months several regions of thailand have experienced severe flooding,
causing damage to infrastructure, housing and factories. a number of the companys suppliers are located in thailand. as with japan, to the extent that component production has been affected, the company will work to obtain alternative sources
of supply or implement other measures. based on the companys current assessment of the situation, it does not believe this event will have a material impact on its operations in the first quarter of 2012; however, because the situation in
thailand is still evolving uncertainty remains regarding the ultimate impact of this event on the company.critical accounting policies
and estimatesthe preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with u.s. generally accepted
accounting principles (gaap) and the companys discussion and analysis of its financial condition and operating results require the companys management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts
reported in its consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. note 1, summary of significant accounting policies of notes to consolidated financial statements in this form 10-k describes the significant accounting policies
and methods used in the preparation of the companys consolidated financial statements. management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results
of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. actual results may differ from these estimates and such differences may be material.26



management believes the companys critical accounting policies and estimates are those
related to revenue recognition, valuation and impairment of marketable securities, inventory valuation and inventory purchase commitments, warranty costs, income taxes, and legal and other contingencies. management considers these policies critical
because they are both important to the portrayal of the companys financial condition and operating results, and they require management to make judgments and estimates about inherently uncertain matters. the companys senior management
has reviewed these critical accounting policies and related disclosures with the audit and finance committee of the companys board of directors.revenue recognitionnet sales consist primarily of revenue from the sale
of hardware, software, digital content and applications, peripherals, and service and support contracts. the company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the sales price is fixed or
determinable, and collection is probable. product is considered delivered to the customer once it has been shipped and title and risk of loss have been transferred. for most of the companys product sales, these criteria are met at the time the
product is shipped. for online sales to individuals, for some sales to education customers in the u.s., and for certain other sales, the company defers recognition of revenue until the customer receives the product because the company retains a
portion of the risk of loss on these sales during transit. the company recognizes revenue from the sale of hardware products, software bundled with hardware that is essential to the functionality of the hardware, and third-party digital content sold
on the itunes store in accordance with general revenue recognition accounting guidance. the company recognizes revenue in accordance with industry specific software accounting guidance for the following types of sales transactions:
(i) standalone sales of software products, (ii) sales of software upgrades and (iii) sales of software bundled with hardware not essential to the functionality of the hardware.for multi-element arrangements that include hardware products containing software essential to the hardware products functionality,
undelivered software elements that relate to the hardware products essential software, and undelivered non-software services, the company allocates revenue to all deliverables based on their relative selling prices. in such circumstances, the
company uses a hierarchy to determine the selling price to be used for allocating revenue to deliverables: (i) vendor-specific objective evidence of fair value (vsoe), (ii) third-party evidence of selling price
(tpe) and (iii) best estimate of the selling price (esp). vsoe generally exists only when the company sells the deliverable separately and is the price actually charged by the company for that deliverable. esps reflect
the companys best estimates of what the selling prices of elements would be if they were sold regularly on a stand-alone basis.for sales of iphone, ipad, apple tv, for sales of ipod touch beginning in june 2010, and for sales of mac beginning in june 2011, the company has indicated it may from time-to-time provide future
unspecified software upgrades and features free of charge to customers. in june 2011, the company announced it would begin providing various non-software services to owners of qualifying versions of ios devices and mac. because the company has
neither vsoe nor tpe for these unspecified software upgrade rights or the non-software services, revenue is allocated to these rights and services based on the companys esps. amounts allocated to the unspecified software upgrade rights and
non-software services are deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis over the estimated lives of each of these devices, which range from 24 to 48 months. the companys process for determining esps involves managements judgment. the
companys process considers multiple factors that may vary over time depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each deliverable. if the facts and circumstances underlying the factors considered change, including the estimated
or actual costs incurred to provide non-software services or the estimated lives of the related devices, or should future facts and circumstances lead the company to consider additional factors, the companys esp for software upgrades and
non-software services related to future sales of these devices could change. if the estimated life of one or more of the devices should change, the future rate of amortization of the revenue allocated to the software upgrade rights would also
change.27



the company records reductions to revenue for estimated commitments related to price
protection and for customer incentive programs, including reseller and end-user rebates, and other sales programs and volume-based incentives. for transactions involving price protection, the company recognizes revenue net of the estimated amount to
be refunded, provided the refund amount can be reasonably and reliably estimated and the other conditions for revenue recognition have been met. the companys policy requires that, if refunds cannot be reliably estimated, revenue is not
recognized until reliable estimates can be made or the price protection lapses. for customer incentive programs, the estimated cost of these programs is recognized at the later of the date at which the company has sold the product or the date at
which the program is offered. the company also records reductions to revenue for expected future product returns based on the companys historical experience. future market conditions and product transitions may require the company to increase
customer incentive programs and incur incremental price protection obligations that could result in additional reductions to revenue at the time such programs are offered. additionally, certain customer incentive programs require management to
estimate the number of customers who will actually redeem the incentive. managements estimates are based on historical experience and the specific terms and conditions of particular incentive programs. if a greater than estimated proportion of
customers redeem such incentives, the company would be required to record additional reductions to revenue, which would have a negative impact on the companys results of operations.valuation and impairment of marketable securitiesthe companys
investments in available-for-sale securities are reported at fair value. unrealized gains and losses related to changes in the fair value of securities are recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income, net of tax, in the companys
consolidated balance sheets. changes in the fair value of available-for-sale securities impact the companys net income only when such securities are sold or an other-than-temporary impairment is recognized. realized gains and losses on the
sale of securities are determined by specific identification of each securitys cost basis. the company regularly reviews its investment portfolio to determine if any security is other-than-temporarily impaired, which would require the company
to record an impairment charge in the period any such determination is made. in making this judgment, the company evaluates, among other things, the duration and extent to which the fair value of a security is less than its cost, the financial
condition of the issuer and any changes thereto, and the companys intent to sell, or whether it is more likely than not it will be required to sell, the security before recovery of the its amortized cost basis. the companys assessment on
whether a security is other-than-temporarily impaired, could change in the future due to new developments or changes in assumptions related to any particular security.inventory valuation and inventory purchase commitmentsthe company must
order components for its products and build inventory in advance of product shipments. the company records a write-down for inventories of components and products, including third-party products held for resale, which have become obsolete or are in
excess of anticipated demand or net realizable value. the company performs a detailed review of inventory each fiscal quarter that considers multiple factors including demand forecasts, product life cycle status, product development plans, current
sales levels, and component cost trends. the industries in which the company competes are subject to a rapid and unpredictable pace of product and component obsolescence and demand changes. if future demand or market conditions for the
companys products are less favorable than forecasted or if unforeseen technological changes negatively impact the utility of component inventory, the company may be required to record additional write-downs, which would negatively affect its
results of operations in the period when the write-downs were recorded.the company records accruals for estimated
cancellation fees related to component orders that have been cancelled or are expected to be cancelled. consistent with industry practice, the company acquires components through a combination of purchase orders, supplier contracts, and open orders
based on projected demand information. these commitments typically cover the companys requirements for periods up to 150 days. if there is an abrupt and substantial decline in demand for one or more of the companys products or an
unanticipated change in technological requirements for any of the companys products, the company may be required to28



record additional accruals for cancellation fees that would negatively affect its results of operations in the period when the cancellation fees are identified and recorded.warranty coststhe
company provides for the estimated cost of hardware and software warranties at the time the related revenue is recognized based on historical and projected warranty claim rates, historical and projected cost-per-claim, and knowledge of specific
product failures that are outside of the companys typical experience. each quarter, the company reevaluates its estimates to assess the adequacy of its recorded warranty liabilities considering the size of the installed base of products
subject to warranty protection and adjusts the amounts as necessary. if actual product failure rates or repair costs differ from estimates, revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required and could materially affect the
companys results of operations.income taxesthe company records a tax provision for the anticipated tax consequences of the reported results of operations. the provision for income taxes is computed using the asset and liability method, under which
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards.
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in effect for the years in which those tax assets are expected to be realized or settled. the company records a valuation allowance
to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is believed more likely than not to be realized.the company recognizes tax
benefits from uncertain tax positions only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. the tax benefits recognized in the financial
statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement.management believes it is more likely than not that forecasted income, including income that may be generated as a result of certain tax planning strategies, together with future reversals of existing
taxable temporary differences, will be sufficient to fully recover the deferred tax assets. in the event that the company determines all or part of the net deferred tax assets are not realizable in the future, the company will make an adjustment to
the valuation allowance that would be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made. in addition, the calculation of tax liabilities involves significant judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of gaap
and complex tax laws. resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with managements expectations could have a material impact on the companys financial condition and operating results.legal and other contingenciesas discussed in part i, item 3 of this form 10-k under the heading legal proceedings and in note 7, commitments and contingencies in notes to consolidated financial
statements, the company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business. the company records a liability when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable. there
is significant judgment required in both the probability determination and as to whether an exposure can be reasonably estimated. in the opinion of management, there was not at least a reasonable possibility the company may have incurred a material
loss, or a material loss in excess of a recorded accrual, with respect to loss contingencies. however, the outcome of legal proceedings and claims brought against the company are subject to significant uncertainty. therefore, although management
considers the likelihood of such an outcome to be remote, if one or more of these legal matters were resolved against the company in the same reporting period for amounts in excess of managements expectations, the companys consolidated
financial statements of a particular reporting period could be materially adversely affected.29

fiscal year 2011 versus 2010net sales during 2011 increased $43.0 billion or 66% compared to 2010. several factors contributed positively to this increase, including
the following:net sales of iphone and related products and services were $47.1 billion in 2011, representing an increase of $21.9 billion or 87% compared to 2010.
iphone handset unit sales totaled 72.3 million during 2011, representing an increase of 32.3 million units or 81% compared to 2010. iphone year-over-year net sales growth reflected strong demand for iphone 4 in all of the companys
operating segments. the expanded u.s. distribution of iphone to the verizon wireless network beginning in february 2011, continued expansion into new countries, and increased distribution with other new carriers and resellers also contributed to the
year-over-year growth of iphone. as of september 24, 2011, the company distributed iphone in 105 countries through 228 carriers. additionally, the company distributes iphone through its direct channels and certain third-party resellers. net
sales of iphone and related products and services accounted for 43% of the companys total net sales for 2011.net sales of ipad and related products and services, which the company introduced in the third quarter of 2010, were $20.4 billion in 2011,
representing an increase of $15.4 billion or 311% compared to 2010. unit sales of ipad were 32.4 million during 2011, an increase of 334% from 2010. the year-over-year unit growth and net sales growth were driven by strong ipad demand in all of
the companys operating segments. the company distributes ipad through its direct channels, certain cellular network carriers distribution channels and certain third-party resellers. the company distributed ipad in 90 countries as of
september 24, 2011 compared to 26 countries as of september 25, 2010. net sales of ipad and related products and services accounted for 19% of the companys total net sales for 2011.mac net sales were $21.8 billion in 2011, representing an increase of $4.3 billion or 25% compared to 2010. mac unit sales increased by
3.1 million or 22% in 2011 compared to 2010. the year-over-year growth in mac net sales and unit sales was due primarily to higher demand in all of the companys operating segments for macbook air and macbook pro, which were updated in
july 2011 and february 2011, respectively. the year-over-year revenue growth for portables and desktops was 36% and 4%, respectively. net sales of the companys macs accounted for 20% of the companys total net sales for 2011.net sales of other music related products and services were $6.3 billion in 2011, representing an increase of $1.4 billion or 28% compared to 2010.
the increase was due primarily to increased net sales from the itunes store, which was largely driven by app store expansion into new countries that contributed to strong growth in all of the companys geographic segments. during 2011, the
combined net sales for the itunes store, app store and ibookstore was $5.4 billion, representing an increase of 33% compared to 2010. the company believes this continued growth is the result of heightened consumer interest in downloading third-party
digital content, continued growth in its customer base of iphone, ipad and ipod, expansion of third-party audio and video content available via the itunes store, and continued interest in and growth of the app store. net sales of other music related
products and services accounted for 6% of the companys total net sales for 2011.partially offsetting
the positive factors contributing to the overall increase in net sales was a decrease in ipod net sales of $821 million or 10% during 2011 compared to 2010. similarly, ipod unit sales decreased by 15% in 2011 compared to 2010. however, net sales per
ipod unit sold increased during 2011 compared to 2010 due primarily to a shift in ipod product mix toward ipod touch. net sales of ipod accounted for 7% of the companys total net sales for 2011.31



fiscal year 2010 versus 2009net sales during 2010 increased $22.3 billion or 52% compared to 2009. several factors contributed positively to this increase, including
the following:net sales of iphone and related products and services were $25.2 billion in 2010 representing an increase of $12.1 billion or 93% compared to 2009.
iphone unit sales totaled 40 million in 2010, which represents an increase of 19.3 million or 93% compared to 2009. iphone year-over-year growth was attributable primarily to continued growth from existing carriers, expanded distribution
with new international carriers and resellers, and strong demand for iphone 4, which was released in the u.s. in june 2010 and in many other countries over the remainder of 2010. as of september 25, 2010, the company distributed iphone in 89
countries through 166 carriers. net sales of iphone and related products and services accounted for 39% of the companys total net sales for 2010 compared to 30% in 2009.net sales of ipad and related products and services were $5.0 billion and unit sales of ipad were 7.5 million during 2010. ipad was released in
the u.s. in april 2010 and in various other countries over the remainder of 2010. as of september 25, 2010, the company distributed ipad in 26 countries. the company distributes ipad through its direct channels, certain cellular network
carriers distribution channels and certain third-party resellers. net sales of ipad and related products and services accounted for 8% of the companys total net sales for 2010, reflecting the strong demand for ipad during the five months
following its release.mac net sales increased by $3.6 billion or 26% in 2010 compared to 2009, and mac unit sales increased by 3.3 million or 31% in 2010 compared to
2009. net sales per mac unit sold decreased by 4% in 2010 compared to 2009 due primarily to lower average selling prices of mac portable systems. during 2010, net sales and unit sales of the companys mac portable systems increased by 18% and
25%, respectively, primarily attributable to strong demand for macbook pro, which was updated in april 2010. net sales and unit sales of the companys mac desktop systems increased by 43% and 45%, respectively, as a result of higher sales of
imac, which was updated in july 2010. net sales of the companys macs accounted for 27% of the companys total net sales in 2010 compared to 32% in 2009.net sales of other music related products and services increased $912 million or 23% during 2010 compared to 2009. this increase was due primarily
to growth of the itunes store which generated total net sales of $4.1 billion for 2010. the results of the itunes store reflect growth of the itunes app store, continued growth in the installed base of iphone, ipad, and ipod customers, and the
expansion of third-party audio and video content available for sale and rent via the itunes store. the company continues to expand its itunes content and applications offerings around the world. net sales of other music related products and services
accounted for 8% of the companys total net sales for 2010 compared to 9% in 2009.net sales of ipods increased $183 million or 2% during 2010, while ipod unit sales declined by 7% during 2010 compared to 2009. net sales per ipod

net sales in the americas segment increased $13.8 billion or 56% compared to 2010. the primary contributors to the growth in net sales was a significant year-over-year increase in iphone revenue from carrier expansion and strong demand for iphone 4
and increased sales of ipad and macs, partially offset by a decrease in ipod net sales. higher sales of third-party digital content and applications from the itunes store and app store also drove an increase in sales during 2011. the americas
segment represented approximately 35% and 37% of the companys total net sales for 2011 and 2010, respectively.during
2010, net sales in the americas segment increased $5.5 billion or 29% compared to 2009. this increase in net sales was driven by increased iphone revenue, strong demand for ipad, continued demand for mac desktop and portable systems, and higher

49%, compared to 2010. the increase in net sales during 2011 was attributable primarily to the continued year-over-year increase in iphone revenue from carrier expansion and strong demand for iphone 4, and increased sales of ipad and macs, partially
offset by a decrease in ipod net sales. the europe segment represented 26% and 29% of total net sales for 2011 and 2010, respectively.during 2010, net sales in europe increased $6.9 billion or 58% compared to 2009. the growth in net sales was due mainly to a significant increase in iphone revenue attributable to continued growth from
existing carriers and country and carrier expansion, increased sales of mac desktop and portable systems and strong demand for ipad, partially offset by a stronger u.s. dollar. the europe segment represented 29% and 28% of the companys total
net sales in 2010 and 2009, respectively.japanjapans net sales increased $1.5 billion or 37% during 2011 compared to 2010. the key contributors to japans net sales growth were increased iphone revenue, strong sales of ipad, increased
sales of macs, and strength in the japanese yen relative to the u.s. dollar. the japan segment represented 5% and 6% of total net sales for 2011 and 2010, respectively.the recent earthquakes and tsunami that struck the northeast coast of japan have created uncertainty regarding general economic and market conditions in japan. any significant impact of these events on
consumer demand could negatively impact the companys net sales in japan in the future. the company does not currently believe that the impact of these events will have a material adverse effect on the company or its results of operations.during 2010, japans net sales increased $1.7 billion or 75% compared to 2009. the primary contributors to this growth
were significant year-over-year increases in iphone revenue, strong demand for ipad, and to a lesser extent strength in the japanese yen. the japan segment represented 6% and 5% of the companys total net sales for 2010 and 2009, respectively.33

during 2011, especially in greater china, which includes hong kong and taiwan. korea and australia also experienced strong year-over-year revenue growth. higher net sales in the asia pacific segment were due mainly to the increase in iphone revenue

gross margingross margin for the three years ended september 24, 2011, are as follows (in millions, except gross margin percentages):net salescost of salesgross margingross margin percentagethe gross margin percentage in 2011 was 40.5%, compared to 39.4% in 2010. this year-over-year increase in
gross margin was largely driven by lower commodity and other product costs.the gross margin percentage in 2010 was 39.4%
compared to 40.1% in 2009. this year-over-year decline in gross margin was primarily attributable to new products that had higher cost structures, including ipad, partially offset by a more favorable sales mix of iphone, which had a higher gross
margin than the company average.the company expects to experience decreases in its gross margin percentage in future
periods, as compared to levels achieved during 2011, largely due to a higher mix of new and innovative products with flat or reduced pricing that have higher cost structures and deliver greater value to customers, and potential future component cost
and other cost increases.the foregoing statements regarding the companys expected gross margin percentage are
forward-looking and could differ from anticipated levels because of several factors including, but not limited to certain of those set forth below in part i, item 1a, risk factors under the subheading future
operating results depend upon the companys ability to obtain components in sufficient quantities, which is incorporated herein by reference. in general, gross margins and margins on individual products will remain under
downward pressure due to a variety of factors, including continued industry wide global product pricing pressures, increased competition, compressed product life cycles, product transitions and potential increases in the cost of components, as well
as potential increases in the costs of outside manufacturing services and a potential shift in the companys sales mix towards products with lower gross margins. in response to these competitive pressures, the company expects it will continue
to take product pricing actions, which would adversely affect gross margins. gross margins could also be affected by the companys ability to manage product quality and warranty costs effectively and to stimulate demand for certain of its
products. due to the companys significant international operations, financial results can be significantly affected in the short-term by fluctuations in exchange rates.operating expensesoperating expenses for the three years ended

r&d expense increased 36% during 2011 compared to 2010, it declined slightly as a percentage of net sales, due to the 66% year-over-year growth in the companys net sales during 2011.r&d expense increased 34% or $449 million to $1.8 billion in 2010 compared to 2009. this increase was due primarily to an
increase in headcount and related expenses in the current year to support expanded r&d activities. also contributing to this increase in r&d expense in 2010 was the capitalization in 2009 of software development costs of $71 million related
to mac os x snow leopard. although total r&d expense increased 34% during 2010, it declined as a percentage of net sales given the 52% year-over-year increase in net sales in 2010.the company continues to believe that focused investments in r&d are critical to its future growth and competitive position in the
marketplace and are directly related to timely development of new and enhanced products that are central to the companys core business strategy. as such, the company expects to make further investments in r&d to remain competitive.selling, general and administrative expense (sg&a)sg&a expense increased $2.1 billion or 38% to $7.6 billion during 2011 compared to 2010. this increase was due primarily to the
companys continued expansion of its retail segment, increased headcount and related costs, higher spending on professional services and marketing and advertising programs, and increased variable costs associated with the overall growth of the
companys net sales.sg&a expense increased $1.4 billion or 33% to $5.5 billion in 2010 compared to 2009. this
increase was due primarily to the companys continued expansion of its retail segment, higher spending on marketing and advertising programs, increased share-based compensation expenses and variable costs associated with the overall growth of
the companys net sales.other income and expenseother income and expense for the three years ended september 24, 2011, are as follows (in millions):interest and dividend incomeother expense, nettotal other income and expensetotal other income and expense increased $260 million or 168% to $415 million during 2011 compared to
$155 million and $326 million in 2010 and 2009, respectively. the year-over-year increase in other income and expense during 2011 was due primarily to higher interest income and net realized gains on sales of marketable securities. the overall
decrease in other income and expense in 2010 compared to 2009 was attributable to the significant declines in interest rates on a year-over-year basis, partially offset by the companys higher cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities
balances. additionally the company incurred higher premium expenses on its foreign exchange option contracts, which further reduced the total other income and expense. the weighted average interest rate earned by the company on its cash, cash
equivalents and marketable securities was 0.77%, 0.75% and 1.43% during 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. during 2011, 2010 and 2009, the company had no debt outstanding and accordingly did not incur any related interest expense.provision for income taxesthe companys effective tax rates were approximately 24.2%, 24.4% and 31.8% for 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. the companys effective rates for these periods differ from the statutory

35% due primarily to certain undistributed foreign earnings for which no u.s. taxes are provided because such earnings are intended to be indefinitely reinvested outside the u.s.as of september 24, 2011, the company had deferred tax assets arising from deductible temporary differences, tax losses, and tax
credits of $3.2 billion, and deferred tax liabilities of $9.2 billion. management believes it is more likely than not that forecasted income, including income that may be generated as a result of certain tax planning strategies, together with future
reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, will be sufficient to fully recover the deferred tax assets. the company will continue to evaluate the realizability of deferred tax assets quarterly by assessing the need for and amount of a
valuation allowance.the internal revenue service (the irs) has completed its field audit of the companys
federal income tax returns for the years 2004 through 2006 and proposed certain adjustments. the company has contested certain of these adjustments through the irs appeals office. the irs is currently examining the years 2007 through 2009. all irs
audit issues for years prior to 2004 have been resolved. in addition, the company is subject to audits by state, local, and foreign tax authorities. management believes that adequate provisions have been made for any adjustments that may result
from tax examinations. however, the outcome of tax audits cannot be predicted with certainty. if any issues addressed in the companys tax audits are resolved in a manner not consistent with managements expectations, the company could be
required to adjust its provision for income taxes in the period such resolution occurs.liquidity and capital resourcesthe following table presents selected financial information and statistics as of and for the three years ended september 24, 2011 (in
millions):cash, cash equivalents and marketable securitiesaccounts receivable, netinventoriesworking capitalannual operating cash flowcash, cash equivalents and marketable securities increased $30.6 billion or 60% during 2011. the
principal components of this net increase was the cash generated by operating activities of $37.5 billion, which was partially offset by payments for acquisition of property, plant and equipment of $4.3 billion, payments for acquisition of
intangible assets of $3.2 billion and payments made in connection with business acquisitions, net of cash acquired, of $244 million. the company believes its existing balances of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities will be sufficient to
satisfy its working capital needs, capital asset purchases, outstanding commitments and other liquidity requirements associated with its existing operations over the next 12 months.the companys marketable securities investment portfolio is invested primarily in highly rated securities and its policy generally
limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. the companys investment policy requires investments to generally be investment grade with the objective of minimizing the potential risk of principal loss. as of september 24, 2011
and september 25, 2010, $54.3 billion and $30.8 billion, respectively, of the companys cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities were held by foreign subsidiaries and are generally based in u.s. dollar-denominated holdings. amounts
held by foreign subsidiaries are generally subject to u.s. income taxation on repatriation to the u.s.capital assetsthe companys capital expenditures were $4.6 billion during 2011, consisting of approximately $614 million for retail store
facilities and $4.0 billion for other capital expenditures, including product tooling and manufacturing37

process equipment, real estate for the future development of the companys second corporate campus, and other corporate facilities and infrastructure. the companys actual cash payments
for capital expenditures during 2011 were $4.3 billion, of which $612 million relates to retail store facilities.the company
anticipates utilizing approximately $8.0 billion for capital expenditures during 2012, including approximately $900 million for retail store facilities and approximately $7.1 billion for product tooling and manufacturing process equipment, and
corporate facilities and infrastructure, including information systems hardware, software and enhancements.during 2012, the
company expects to open about 40 new retail stores, approximately three-quarters of which will be located outside of the u.s.off-balance
sheet arrangements and contractual obligationsthe company has not entered into any transactions with unconsolidated
entities whereby the company has financial guarantees, subordinated retained interests, derivative instruments, or other contingent arrangements that expose the company to material continuing risks, contingent liabilities, or any other obligation
under a variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing, liquidity, market risk, or credit risk support to the company.the following table presents certain payments due by the company under contractual obligations with minimum firm commitments as of september 24, 2011 and excludes amounts already recorded on the
consolidated balance sheet (in millions):operating leasespurchase obligationsother obligationstotallease commitmentsthe companys major facility leases are typically for terms not exceeding 10 years and generally provide renewal options for terms not exceeding five additional years. leases for retail space are for
terms ranging from five to 20 years, the majority of which are for 10 years, and often contain multi-year renewal options. as of september 24, 2011, the companys total future minimum lease payments under noncancelable operating leases
were $3.0 billion, of which $2.4 billion related to leases for retail space.purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and
component suppliersthe company utilizes several outsourcing partners to manufacture sub-assemblies for the companys
products and to perform final assembly and test of finished products. these outsourcing partners acquire components and build product based on demand information supplied by the company, which typically covers periods up to 150 days. the company
also obtains individual components for its products from a wide variety of individual suppliers. consistent with industry practice, the company acquires components through a combination of purchase orders, supplier contracts, and open orders based
on projected demand information. as of september 24, 2011, the company had outstanding off-balance sheet third-party manufacturing commitments and component purchase commitments of $13.9 billion.38


## Item 7A


interest rate riskwhile the company is exposed to interest rate fluctuations in many of the worlds leading industrialized countries, the companys interest income and expense is most sensitive to fluctuations in
u.s. interest rates. changes in u.s. interest rates affect the interest earned on the companys cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, the fair value of those securities, as well as costs associated with hedging.the companys investment policy and strategy are focused on preservation of capital and supporting the liquidity requirements of the
company. a portion of the companys cash is managed by external managers within the guidelines of the companys investment policy and to objective market benchmarks. the companys internal portfolio is benchmarked against external
manager performance.the companys exposure to changes in interest rates relates primarily to the companys
investment portfolio. the company typically invests in highly rated securities and its policy generally limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. the companys investment policy generally requires investments to be investment
grade, with the objective of minimizing the potential risk of principal loss.to provide a meaningful assessment of the
interest rate risk associated with the companys investment portfolio, the company performed a sensitivity analysis to determine the impact a change in interest rates would have on the value of the investment portfolio assuming a 100 basis
point parallel shift in the yield curve. based on investment positions as of september 24, 2011, a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates across all maturities would result in a $913 million incremental decline in the fair
market value of the portfolio. as of september 25, 2010, a similar 100 basis point shift in the yield curve would have resulted in a $477 million incremental decline in the fair market value of the portfolio. such losses would only be realized
if the company sold the investments prior to maturity.foreign currency riskin general, the company is a net receiver of currencies other than the u.s. dollar. accordingly, changes in exchange rates, and in
particular a strengthening of the u.s. dollar, will negatively affect the companys net sales and gross margins as expressed in u.s. dollars. there is a risk that the company will have to adjust local currency product pricing due to competitive
pressures when there have been significant volatility in foreign currency exchange rates.the company may enter into foreign
currency forward and option contracts with financial institutions to protect against foreign exchange risks associated with certain existing assets and liabilities, certain firmly committed transactions, forecasted future cash flows, and net
investments in foreign subsidiaries. generally, the companys practice is to hedge a majority of its material foreign exchange exposures, typically for up to six months. however, the company may choose not to hedge certain foreign exchange
exposures for a variety of reasons, including but not limited to accounting considerations and the prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures.to provide a meaningful assessment of the foreign currency risk associated with certain of the companys foreign currency derivative positions, the company performed a sensitivity analysis using a
value-at-risk (var) model to assess the potential impact of fluctuations in exchange rates. the var model consisted of using a monte carlo simulation to generate thousands of random market price paths assuming normal market conditions.
the var is the maximum expected loss in fair value, for a given confidence interval, to the companys foreign currency derivative positions due to adverse movements in rates. the var model is not intended to represent actual losses but is used
as a risk estimation and management tool. the model assumes normal market conditions. forecasted transactions, firm commitments, and assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies were excluded from the model. based on the results of the
model, the company estimates with 95% confidence a maximum one-day loss in fair value of $161 million as of september 24, 2011 compared to a40



maximum one-day loss in fair value of $103 million as of september 25, 2010. because the company uses foreign currency instruments for hedging purposes, the loss in fair value incurred on
those instruments are generally offset by increases in the fair value of the underlying exposures.actual future gains and
losses associated with the companys investment portfolio and derivative positions may differ materially from the sensitivity analyses performed as of september 24, 2011 due to the inherent limitations associated with predicting the timing
and amount of changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchanges rates and the companys actual exposures and positions.41

notes to consolidated financial statementsnote 1  summary of significant accounting policiesapple inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries (collectively apple or the company) designs, manufactures, and markets mobile communication and media devices, personal computers, and
portable digital music players, and sells a variety of related software, services, peripherals, networking solutions, and third-party digital content and applications. the company sells its products worldwide through its retail stores, online
stores, and direct sales force, as well as through third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers and value-added resellers. in addition, the company sells a variety of third-party iphone, ipad, mac, and ipod compatible products
including application software, printers, storage devices, speakers, headphones, and various other accessories and supplies through its online and retail stores. the company sells to consumers, small and mid-sized businesses, education, enterprise
and government customers.basis of presentation and preparationthe accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the company. intercompany accounts and transactions have been
eliminated. the preparation of these consolidated financial statements in conformity with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles (gaap) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in
these consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. actual results could differ materially from those estimates. certain prior year amounts in the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto have been reclassified to conform to
the current years presentation.the companys fiscal year is the 52 or 53-week period that ends on the last
saturday of september. the companys fiscal years 2011, 2010 and 2009 ended on september 24, 2011, september 25, 2010 and september 26, 2009, respectively, and included 52 weeks each. an additional week is included in the
first fiscal quarter approximately every six years to realign fiscal quarters with calendar quarters. fiscal year 2012 will end on september 29, 2012, and will span 53 weeks, with a 14th week added to the first quarter of 2012. unless otherwise
stated, references to particular years or quarters refer to the companys fiscal years ended in september and the associated quarters of those fiscal years.during the first quarter of 2011, the company adopted the financial accounting standard boards (fasb) new accounting standard on consolidation of variable interest
entities. this new accounting standard eliminates the mandatory quantitative approach in determining control for evaluating whether variable interest entities need to be consolidated in favor of a qualitative analysis, and requires an
ongoing reassessment of control over such entities. the adoption of this new accounting standard did not impact the companys consolidated financial statements.revenue recognitionnet sales consist primarily of revenue from the sale
of hardware, software, digital content and applications, peripherals, and service and support contracts. the company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the sales price is fixed or
determinable, and collection is probable. product is considered delivered to the customer once it has been shipped and title and risk of loss have been transferred. for most of the companys product sales, these criteria are met at the time the
product is shipped. for online sales to individuals, for some sales to education customers in the u.s., and for certain other sales, the company defers revenue until the customer receives the product because the company legally retains a portion of
the risk of loss on these sales during transit. the company recognizes revenue from the sale of hardware products, software bundled with hardware that is essential to the functionality of the hardware, and third-party digital content sold on the
itunes store in accordance with general revenue recognition accounting guidance. the company recognizes revenue in accordance with industry specific software accounting guidance for the following types of sales transactions: (i) standalone
sales of software products, (ii) sales of software upgrades and (iii) sales of software bundled with hardware not essential to the functionality of the hardware.47



the company sells software and peripheral products obtained from other companies. the
company generally establishes its own pricing and retains related inventory risk, is the primary obligor in sales transactions with its customers, and assumes the credit risk for amounts billed to its customers. accordingly, the company generally
recognizes revenue for the sale of products obtained from other companies based on the gross amount billed. for sales of third-party software applications for iphone, ipad and ipod touch (ios devices) and macs made through the app store
and the mac app store, the company is not the primary obligor to users of the software, and third- party developers determine the selling price of their software. therefore, the company accounts for such sales on a net basis by recognizing only the
commission it retains from each sale and including that commission in net sales in the consolidated statements of operations. the portion of the sales price paid by users that is remitted by the company to third-party developers is not reflected in
the companys consolidated statements of operations.the company records deferred revenue when it receives payments in
advance of the delivery of products or the performance of services. this includes amounts that have been deferred for unspecified and specified software upgrade rights and non-software services that are attached to hardware and software products.
the company sells gift cards redeemable at its retail and online stores, and also sells gift cards redeemable on the itunes store for the purchase of content and software. the company records deferred revenue upon the sale of the card, which is
relieved upon redemption of the card by the customer. revenue from applecare service and support contracts is deferred and recognized over the service coverage periods. applecare service and support contracts typically include extended phone
support, repair services, web-based support resources and diagnostic tools offered under the companys standard limited warranty.the company records reductions to revenue for estimated commitments related to price protection and for customer incentive programs, including reseller and end-user rebates, and other sales programs and
volume-based incentives. the estimated cost of these programs is recognized in the period the company has sold the product and committed to a plan. the company also records reductions to revenue for expected future product returns based on the
companys historical experience. revenue is recorded net of taxes collected from customers that are remitted to governmental authorities, with the collected taxes recorded as current liabilities until remitted to the relevant government
authority.revenue recognition for arrangements with multiple deliverablesfor multi-element arrangements that include hardware products containing software essential to the hardware products functionality,
undelivered software elements that relate to the hardware products essential software, and undelivered non-software services, the company allocates revenue to all deliverables based on their relative selling prices. in such circumstances, the
company uses a hierarchy to determine the selling price to be used for allocating revenue to deliverables: (i) vendor-specific objective evidence of fair value (vsoe), (ii) third-party evidence of selling price
(tpe), and (iii) best estimate of the selling price (esp). vsoe generally exists only when the company sells the deliverable separately and is the price actually charged by the company for that deliverable. esps reflect
the companys best estimates of what the selling prices of elements would be if they were sold regularly on a stand-alone basis.for sales of iphone, ipad, apple tv, for sales of ipod touch beginning in june 2010, and for sales of mac beginning in june 2011, the company has indicated it may from time-to-time provide future
unspecified software upgrades and features to the essential software bundled with each of these hardware products free of charge to customers. essential software for ios devices includes ios and related applications and for mac includes mac os x and
ilife. in june 2011, the company announced it would provide various non-software services to owners of qualifying versions of ios devices and mac. the company has identified up to three deliverables in arrangements involving the sale of these
devices. the first deliverable is the hardware and software essential to the functionality of the hardware device delivered at the time of sale. the second deliverable is the embedded right included with the purchase of ios devices, mac and apple tv
to receive on a when-and-if-available basis, future unspecified software upgrades and features relating to the products essential software. the third48



deliverable is the non-software services to be provided to qualifying versions of ios devices and mac. the company allocates revenue between these deliverables using the relative selling price
method. because the company has neither vsoe nor tpe for these deliverables, the allocation of revenue has been based on the companys esps. amounts allocated to the delivered hardware and the related essential software are recognized at the
time of sale provided the other conditions for revenue recognition have been met. amounts allocated to the embedded unspecified software upgrade rights and the non-software services are deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis over the
estimated lives of each of these devices, which range from 24 to 48 months. cost of sales related to delivered hardware and related essential software, including estimated warranty costs, are recognized at the time of sale. costs incurred to provide
non-software services are recognized as cost of sales as incurred, and engineering and sales and marketing costs are recognized as operating expenses as incurred.the companys process for determining its esp for deliverables without vsoe or tpe considers multiple factors that may vary depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each
deliverable. the company believes its customers, particularly consumers, would be reluctant to buy unspecified software upgrade rights related to ios devices, mac and apple tv. this view is primarily based on the fact that unspecified upgrade rights
do not obligate the company to provide upgrades at a particular time or at all, and do not specify to customers which upgrades or features will be delivered. the company also believes its customers would be unwilling to pay a significant amount for
access to the non-software services because other companies offer similar services at little or no cost to users. therefore, the company has concluded that if it were to sell upgrade rights or access to the non-software services on a standalone
basis, including those rights and services attached to ios devices, mac and apple tv, the selling prices would be relatively low. key factors considered by the company in developing the esps for software upgrade rights include prices charged by the
company for similar offerings, market trends for pricing of mac and ios compatible software, the companys historical pricing practices, the nature of the upgrade rights (e.g., unspecified and when-and-if-available), and the relative esp of the
upgrade rights as compared to the total selling price of the product. the company may also consider, when appropriate, the impact of other products and services, including advertising services, on selling price assumptions when developing and
reviewing its esps for software upgrade rights and related deliverables. the company may also consider additional factors as appropriate, including the pricing of competitive alternatives if they exist and product-specific business objectives. when
relevant, the same factors are considered by the company in developing esps for offerings such as the non-software services; however, the primary consideration in developing esps for the non-software services is the estimated cost to provide such
services over the estimated life of the related devices, including consideration for a reasonable profit margin.beginning
with the companys june 2011 announcement of the upcoming release of the non-software services and mac os x lion, the companys combined esp for the unspecified software upgrade rights and the right to receive the non-software services are
as follows: $16 for iphone and ipad, $11 for ipod touch, and $22 for mac. the companys esp for the embedded unspecified software upgrade right included with each apple tv is $5 for 2011 and $10 for fiscal years prior to 2011. amounts allocated
to the embedded unspecified software upgrade rights and the non-software services associated with ios devices and apple tv are recognized on a straight-line basis over 24 months, and amounts allocated to the embedded unspecified software upgrade
rights and the non-software services associated with macs are recognized on a straight-line basis over 48 months.the
companys esp for the software upgrade right included with each iphone sold beginning with the introduction of iphone in june 2007 through the companys second quarter of 2010 was $25. beginning in april 2010 in conjunction with the
companys announcement of ios 4 for iphone, the company lowered its esp for the software upgrade right included with each iphone to $10. beginning with initial sales of ipad in april 2010, the companys esp for the embedded software
upgrade right included with the sale of each ipad is $10, and the companys esp for the embedded software upgrade right included with each ipod touch sold beginning in june 2010 is $5.the company accounts for multiple element arrangements that consist only of software or software-related products, including the sale of
upgrades to previously sold software, in accordance with industry specific49



software accounting guidance. for such transactions, revenue on arrangements that include multiple elements is allocated to each element based on the relative fair value of each element, and fair
value is determined by vsoe. if the company cannot objectively determine the fair value of any undelivered element included in such multiple-element arrangements, the company defers revenue until all elements are delivered and services have been
performed, or until fair value can objectively be determined for any remaining undelivered elements. beginning in july 2011, the sale of certain upgrades to mac os x and mac versions of ilife include when-and-if-available upgrade rights for which
the company does not have vsoe. therefore, beginning in july 2011 the company defers all revenue from the sale of upgrades to the mac os and mac versions of ilife and recognizes it ratably over 36 months.shipping costsfor all
periods presented, amounts billed to customers related to shipping and handling are classified as revenue, and the companys shipping and handling costs are included in cost of sales.warranty expensethe company generally provides for the estimated cost of
hardware and software warranties at the time the related revenue is recognized. the company assesses the adequacy of its pre-existing warranty liabilities and adjusts the amounts as necessary based on actual experience and changes in future
estimates.software development costsresearch and development costs are expensed as incurred. development costs of computer software to be sold, leased, or otherwise marketed are subject to capitalization beginning when a products
technological feasibility has been established and ending when a product is available for general release to customers. in most instances, the companys products are released soon after technological feasibility has been established. therefore,
costs incurred subsequent to achievement of technological feasibility are usually not significant, and generally most software development costs have been expensed as incurred.the company did not capitalize any software development costs during 2011 and 2010. in 2009, the company capitalized $71 million of costs
associated with the development of mac os x version 10.6 snow leopard (mac os x snow leopard), which was released during the fourth quarter of 2009. the capitalized costs are being amortized to cost of sales on a straight-line basis over
a three year estimated useful life of the underlying technology.total amortization related to capitalized software
development costs was $30 million, $48 million and $25 million in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.advertising costsadvertising costs are expensed as incurred. advertising expense was $933 million, $691 million and $501 million for 2011, 2010 and 2009,
respectively.share-based compensationthe company recognizes expense related to share-based payment transactions in which it receives employee services in exchange for (a) equity instruments of the company or (b) liabilities that
are based on the fair value of the enterprises equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of such equity instruments. share-based compensation cost for restricted stock units (rsus) is measured based on the closing
fair market value of the companys common stock on the date of grant. share-based compensation cost for stock options is estimated at the grant date based on each options fair-value as calculated by the black-scholes-merton
(bsm) option-pricing model. the company recognizes share-based compensation cost as expense ratably on a straight-line50

basis over the requisite service period. the company recognizes a benefit from share-based compensation in the consolidated statements of shareholders equity if an incremental tax benefit
is realized. in addition, the company recognizes the indirect effects of share-based compensation on research and development tax credits, foreign tax credits and domestic manufacturing deductions in the consolidated statements of operations.
further information regarding share-based compensation can be found in note 6, shareholders equity and share-based compensation of this form 10-k.income taxesthe provision for income taxes is computed using the asset
and liability method, under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, and for operating losses
and tax credit carryforwards. deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in effect for the years in which those tax assets are expected to be realized or settled. the company
records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is believed more likely than not to be realized.the company recognizes the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not the tax position will be
sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50%
likelihood of being realized upon settlement. see note 5, income taxes of this form 10-k for additional information.earnings
per common sharebasic earnings per common share is computed by dividing income available to common shareholders by the
weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. diluted earnings per common share is computed by dividing income available to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding
during the period increased to include the number of additional shares of common stock that would have been outstanding if the potentially dilutive securities had been issued. potentially dilutive securities include outstanding stock options, shares
to be purchased under the employee stock purchase plan and unvested rsus. the dilutive effect of potentially dilutive securities is reflected in diluted earnings per common share by application of the treasury stock method. under the treasury stock
method, an increase in the fair market value of the companys common stock can result in a greater dilutive effect from potentially dilutive securities.the following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted earnings per common share for the three years ended september 24, 2011 (in thousands, except net income in millions and per share

financial instrumentscash equivalents and marketable securitiesall highly liquid investments
with maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase are classified as cash equivalents. the companys marketable debt and equity securities have been classified and accounted for as available-for-sale. management determines the
appropriate classification of its investments at the time of purchase and reevaluates the designations at each balance sheet date. the company classifies its marketable debt securities as either short-term or long-term based on each
instruments underlying contractual maturity date. marketable debt securities with maturities of 12 months or less are classified as short-term and marketable debt securities with maturities greater than 12 months are classified as long-term.
the company classifies its marketable equity securities, including mutual funds, as either short-term or long-term based on the nature of each security and its availability for use in current operations. the companys marketable debt and equity
securities are carried at fair value, with the unrealized gains and losses, net of taxes, reported as a component of shareholders equity. the cost of securities sold is based upon the specific identification method.derivative financial instrumentsthe company accounts for its derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities and carries them at fair value.for derivative instruments that hedge the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows that are designated as cash flow hedges, the effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative
instrument is reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (aoci) in shareholders equity and reclassified into income in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. the
ineffective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative instrument, if any, is recognized in current income. to receive hedge accounting treatment, cash flow hedges must be highly effective in offsetting changes to expected future cash flows on
hedged transactions. for options designated as cash flow hedges, changes in the time value are excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and are recognized in income. for derivative instruments that hedge the exposure to changes in the
fair value of an asset or a liability and that are designated as fair value hedges, both the net gain or loss on the derivative instrument as well as the offsetting gain or loss on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are recognized in
earnings in the current period. the company had no fair value hedges in 2011, 2010 and 2009. the net gain or loss on the effective portion of a derivative instrument that is designated as an economic hedge of the foreign currency translation
exposure of the net investment in a foreign operation is reported in the same manner as a foreign currency translation adjustment. for forward exchange contracts designated as net investment hedges, the company excludes changes in fair value
relating to changes in the forward carry component from its definition of effectiveness. accordingly, any gains or losses related to this component are recognized in current income. derivatives that do not qualify as hedges must be adjusted to fair
value through current income.allowance for doubtful accountsthe company records its allowance for doubtful accounts based upon its assessment of various factors. the company considers historical experience, the age of the accounts receivable balances, credit
quality of the companys customers, current economic conditions, and other factors that may affect customers ability to pay.inventoriesinventories
are stated at the lower of cost, computed using the first-in, first-out method, or market. if the cost of the inventories exceeds their market value, provisions are made currently for the difference between the cost and the market value. the
companys inventories consist primarily of components and finished goods for all periods presented.52



property, plant and equipmentproperty, plant and equipment are stated at cost. depreciation is computed by use of the straight-line method over the estimated useful
lives of the assets, which for buildings is the lesser of 30 years or the remaining life of the underlying building, up to five years for equipment, and the shorter of lease terms or ten years for leasehold improvements. the company capitalizes
eligible costs to acquire or develop internal-use software that are incurred subsequent to the preliminary project stage. capitalized costs related to internal-use software are amortized using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives
of the assets, which range from three to five years. depreciation and amortization expense on property and equipment was $1.6 billion, $815 million and $606 million during 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.long-lived assets including goodwill and other acquired intangible assetsthe company reviews property, plant and equipment and certain identifiable intangibles, excluding goodwill, for impairment. long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. recoverability of these assets is measured by comparison of their carrying amounts to future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate. if property,
plant and equipment and certain identifiable intangibles are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized equals the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds its fair market value. the company did not record any
significant impairments during 2011, 2010 and 2009.the company does not amortize goodwill and intangible assets with
indefinite useful lives, rather such assets are required to be tested for impairment at least annually or sooner whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the assets may be impaired. the company performs its goodwill and intangible
asset impairment tests in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year. the company did not recognize any goodwill or intangible asset impairment charges in 2011, 2010 and 2009. the company established reporting units based on its current reporting
structure. for purposes of testing goodwill for impairment, goodwill has been allocated to these reporting units to the extent it relates to each reporting unit.the company amortizes its intangible assets with definite lives over their estimated useful lives and reviews these assets for impairment. the company is currently amortizing its acquired intangible
assets with definite lives over periods generally ranging between three to seven years.fair value measurementsthe company applies fair value accounting for all financial assets and liabilities and non-financial assets and liabilities that are
recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis. the company defines fair value as the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market
participants at the measurement date. when determining the fair value measurements for assets and liabilities, which are required to be recorded at fair value, the company considers the principal or most advantageous market in which the company
would transact and the market-based risk measurements or assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, such as risks inherent in valuation techniques, transfer restrictions and credit risk. fair value is estimated
by applying the following hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value into three levels and bases the categorization within the hierarchy upon the lowest level of input that is available and significant to the fair value
measurement:level 1  quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.level 2  observable inputs other than quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities, quoted prices
for identical or similar assets or liabilities in inactive markets, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.53



level 3  inputs that are generally unobservable and typically reflect
managements estimate of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability.the
companys valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of money market funds and certain marketable equity securities were derived from quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. the valuation techniques used to
measure the fair value of all other financial instruments, all of which have counterparties with high credit ratings, were valued based on quoted market prices or model driven valuations using significant inputs derived from or corroborated by
observable market data.in accordance with the fair value accounting requirements, companies may choose to measure eligible
financial instruments and certain other items at fair value. the company has not elected the fair value option for any eligible financial instruments.foreign currency translation and remeasurementthe company translates the
assets and liabilities of its non-u.s. dollar functional currency subsidiaries into u.s. dollars using exchange rates in effect at the end of each period. revenue and expenses for these subsidiaries are translated using rates that approximate those
in effect during the period. gains and losses from these translations are recognized in foreign currency translation included in accumulated other comprehensive income in shareholders equity. the companys subsidiaries that use the u.s.
dollar as their functional currency remeasure monetary assets and liabilities at exchange rates in effect at the end of each period, and inventories, property, and nonmonetary assets and liabilities at historical rates. gains and losses from these
remeasurements were insignificant and have been included in the companys results of operations.segment informationthe company reports segment information based on the management approach. the management approach designates the internal
reporting used by management for making decisions and assessing performance as the source of the companys reportable segments. information about the companys products, major customers and geographic areas on a company-wide basis is also
disclosed.54

the net unrealized gains as of september 24, 2011 and september 25, 2010 related
primarily to long-term marketable securities. the company may sell certain of its marketable securities prior to their stated maturities for strategic reasons including, but not limited to, anticipation of credit deterioration and duration
management. the company recognized net realized gains of $110 million during 2011 and no significant net realized gains or losses during 2010 and 2009 related to such sales. the maturities of the companys long-term marketable securities
generally range from one year to five years.as of september 24, 2011 and september 25, 2010, gross unrealized
losses related to individual securities that had been in a continuous loss position for 12 months or longer were not significant.the company considers the declines in market value of its marketable securities investment portfolio to be temporary in nature. the company typically invests in highly-rated securities, and its policy
generally limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. the companys investment policy requires investments to generally be investment grade, with the primary objective of minimizing the potential risk of principal loss. fair values
were determined for each individual security in the investment portfolio. when evaluating the investments for other-than-temporary impairment, the company reviews factors such as the length of time and extent to which fair value has been below cost
basis, the financial condition of the issuer and any changes thereto, and the companys intent to sell, or whether it is more likely than not it will be required to sell, the investment before recovery of the investments amortized cost
basis. during 2011, 2010 and 2009, the company did not recognize any significant impairment charges. as of september 24, 2011, the company does not consider any of its investments to be other-than-temporarily impaired.derivative financial instrumentsthe company uses derivatives to partially offset its business exposure to foreign currency exchange risk. the company may enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts to offset some of the
foreign exchange risk on expected future cash flows on certain forecasted revenue and cost of sales, on net investments in certain foreign subsidiaries, and on certain existing assets and liabilities.to help protect gross margins from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, certain of the companys subsidiaries whose
functional currency is the u.s. dollar hedge a portion of forecasted foreign currency revenue. the companys subsidiaries whose functional currency is not the u.s. dollar and who sell in local currencies may hedge a portion of forecasted
inventory purchases not denominated in the subsidiaries functional currencies. the company typically hedges portions of its forecasted foreign currency exposure associated with revenue and inventory purchases generally up to six months.to help protect the net investment in a foreign operation from adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates, the
company may enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts to offset the changes in the carrying amounts of these investments due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.the company may also enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts to partially offset the foreign currency exchange gains and
losses generated by the re-measurement of certain assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies. however, the company may choose not to hedge certain foreign currency exchange exposures for a variety of reasons including, but not
limited to, accounting considerations and the prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures. there can be no assurance the hedges will offset more than a portion of the financial impact resulting from movements in foreign currency
exchange rates.the company records all derivatives on the consolidated balance sheets at fair value. the companys
accounting policies for these instruments are based on whether the instruments are designated as hedge or non-hedge instruments. the effective portions of cash flow hedges are recorded in aoci until the hedged item is recognized in earnings. the
effective portions of net investment hedges are recorded in other comprehensive income as a part of the cumulative translation adjustment. the ineffective portions of cash flow hedges and net56

investment hedges are recorded in other income and expense. derivatives that are not designated as hedging instruments are adjusted to fair value through earnings in the financial statement line
item the derivative relates to.the company had a net deferred gain associated with cash flow hedges of approximately $290
million and a net deferred loss associated with cash flow hedges of approximately $252 million, net of taxes, recorded in aoci as of september 24, 2011 and september 25, 2010, respectively. deferred gains and losses associated with cash
flow hedges of foreign currency revenue are recognized as a component of net sales in the same period as the related revenue is recognized, and deferred gains and losses related to cash flow hedges of inventory purchases are recognized as a
component of cost of sales in the same period as the related costs are recognized. substantially all of the companys hedged transactions as of september 24, 2011 are expected to occur within six months.derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges must be de-designated as hedges when it is probable the forecasted hedged
transaction will not occur in the initially identified time period or within a subsequent two-month time period. deferred gains and losses in aoci associated with such derivative instruments are reclassified immediately into other income and
expense. any subsequent changes in fair value of such derivative instruments are reflected in other income and expense unless they are re-designated as hedges of other transactions. the company did not recognize any significant net gains or losses
related to the loss of hedge designation on discontinued cash flow hedges during 2011, 2010 and 2009.the companys
unrealized net gains and losses on net investment hedges, included in the cumulative translation adjustment account of aoci, were not significant as of september 24, 2011 and september 25, 2010, respectively. the ineffective portions and
amounts excluded from the effectiveness test of net investment hedges are recorded in other income and expense.the company
recognized in other income and expense a net loss of $158 million, $123 million and $133 million on foreign currency forward and option contracts not designated as hedging instruments during 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. these amounts represent
the net gain or loss on the derivative contracts and do not include changes in the related exposures, which generally offset a portion of the gain or loss on the derivative contracts.the following table summarizes the notional principal amounts of the companys outstanding derivative instruments and credit risk
amounts associated with outstanding or unsettled derivative instruments as of september 24, 2011 and september 25, 2010 (in millions):instruments qualifying as accounting hedges:foreign exchange contractsinstruments other than accounting hedges:foreign exchange contractsthe notional principal amounts for outstanding derivative instruments provide one measure of the
transaction volume outstanding and do not represent the amount of the companys exposure to credit or market loss. the credit risk amounts represent the companys gross exposure to potential accounting loss on derivative instruments that
are outstanding or unsettled if all counterparties failed to perform according to the terms of the contract, based on then-current currency exchange rates at each respective date. the companys gross exposure on these transactions may be
further mitigated by collateral received from certain counterparties. the companys exposure to credit loss and market risk will vary over time as a function of currency exchange rates. although the table above reflects the notional principal
and credit risk amounts of the companys foreign exchange instruments, it does not reflect the gains or losses associated with the exposures and transactions that the foreign57

exchange instruments are intended to hedge. the amounts ultimately realized upon settlement of these financial instruments, together with the gains and losses on the underlying exposures, will
depend on actual market conditions during the remaining life of the instruments.the company generally enters into master
netting arrangements, which reduce credit risk by permitting net settlement of transactions with the same counterparty. to further limit credit risk, the company generally enters into collateral security arrangements that provide for collateral to

outstanding with its third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers, value-added resellers, small and mid-sized businesses, and education, enterprise and government customers. the company generally does not require collateral from its
customers; however, the company will require collateral in certain instances to limit credit risk. in addition, when possible, the company attempts to limit credit risk on trade receivables with credit insurance for certain customers or by requiring
third-party financing, loans or leases to support credit exposure. these credit-financing arrangements are directly between the third-party financing company and the end customer. as such, the company generally does not assume any recourse or credit
risk sharing related to any of these arrangements.as of september 24, 2011, there were no customers that accounted for
10% or more of the companys total trade receivables. trade receivables from two of the companys customers accounted for 15% and 12% of total trade receivables as of september 25, 2010. the companys cellular network carriers
accounted for 52% and 64% of trade receivables as of september 24, 2011 and september 25, 2010, respectively. the additions and write-offs to the companys allowance for doubtful accounts during 2011, 2010 and 2009 were not
significant.59

billion and $6.6 billion in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. the companys consolidated financial statements provide for any related tax liability on amounts that may be repatriated, aside from undistributed earnings of certain of the
companys foreign subsidiaries that are intended to be indefinitely reinvested in operations outside the u.s. as of september 24, 2011, u.s. income taxes have not been provided on a cumulative total of $23.4 billion of such earnings. the
amount of unrecognized deferred tax liability related to these temporary differences is estimated to be approximately $8.0 billion.as of september 24, 2011 and september 25, 2010, $54.3 billion and $30.8 billion, respectively, of the companys cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities were held by foreign
subsidiaries and are generally based in u.s. dollar-denominated holdings. amounts held by foreign subsidiaries are generally subject to u.s. income taxation on repatriation to the u.s.deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect the effects of tax losses, credits, and the future income tax effects of temporary
differences between the consolidated financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and are measured using enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary
differences are expected to be recovered or settled.62

awards. for stock options, the company receives an income tax benefit calculated as the difference between the fair market value of the stock issued at the time of the exercise and the option price, tax effected. for rsus, the company receives
an income tax benefit upon the awards vesting equal to the tax effect of the underlying stocks fair market value. the company had net excess tax benefits from equity awards of $1.1 billion, $742 million and $246 million in 2011, 2010 and
2009, respectively, which were reflected as increases to common stock.uncertain tax positionstax positions are evaluated in a two-step process. the company first determines whether it is more likely than not that a tax position
will be sustained upon examination. if a tax position meets the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold it is then measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements. the tax position is measured as the largest
amount of benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. the company classifies gross interest and penalties and unrecognized tax benefits that are not expected to result in payment or receipt of cash within one
year as non-current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets.63

as of september 24, 2011, the total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits was $1.4

income taxes. as of september 24, 2011 and september 25, 2010, the total amount of gross interest and penalties accrued was $261 million and $247 million, respectively, which is classified as non-current liabilities in the consolidated
balance sheets. in connection with tax matters, the company recognized interest expense in 2011 and 2009 of $14 million and $64 million, respectively, and in 2010 the company recognized an interest benefit of $43 million.the company is subject to taxation and files income tax returns in the u.s. federal jurisdiction and in many state and foreign
jurisdictions. for u.s. federal income tax purposes, all years prior to 2004 are closed. the internal revenue service (the irs) has completed its field audit of the companys federal income tax returns for the years 2004 through
2006 and proposed certain adjustments. the company has contested certain of these adjustments through the irs appeals office. the irs is currently examining the years 2007 through 2009. in addition, the company is also subject to audits by state,
local and foreign tax authorities. in major states and major foreign jurisdictions, the years subsequent to 1988 and 2001, respectively, generally remain open and could be subject to examination by the taxing authorities.management believes that an adequate provision has been made for any adjustments that may result from tax examinations. however, the
outcome of tax audits cannot be predicted with certainty. if any issues addressed in the companys tax audits are resolved in a manner not consistent with managements expectations, the company could be required to adjust its provision for
income tax in the period such resolution occurs. although timing of the resolution and/or closure of audits is not certain, the company does not believe it is reasonably possible that its unrecognized tax benefits would materially change in the next
12 months.note 6  shareholders equity and share-based compensationpreferred stockthe

employees, including executive officers. the 2003 plan permits the granting of incentive stock options, nonstatutory stock options, rsus, stock appreciation rights, stock purchase rights and performance-based awards. options granted under the 2003
plan generally expire seven to ten years after the grant date and generally become exercisable over a period of four years, based on continued employment, with either annual, semi-annual or quarterly vesting. in general, rsus granted under the 2003
plan vest over two to four years, based on continued employment and are settled upon vesting in shares of the companys common stock on a one-for-one basis. each share issued with respect to an award granted under the 2003 plan (other than a
stock option or stock appreciation right) reduces the number of shares available for grant under the plan by two shares, whereas shares issued in respect of an option or stock appreciation right count against the number of shares available for grant
on a one-for-one basis. as of september 24, 2011, approximately 50.8 million shares were reserved for future issuance under the 2003 plan.65



1997 director stock planthe 1997 director stock plan (the director plan) is a shareholder approved plan that (i) permits the company to grant awards of rsus or stock options to the companys non-employee
directors, (ii) provides for automatic initial grants of rsus upon a non-employee director joining the board and automatic annual grants of rsus at each annual meeting of shareholders, and (iii) permits the board to prospectively change
the relative mixture of stock options and rsus for the initial and annual award grants and the methodology for determining the number of shares of the companys common stock subject to these grants without shareholder approval. each share
issued with respect to rsus granted under the director plan reduces the number of shares available for grant under the plan by two shares. the director plan expires november 9, 2019. as of september 24, 2011, approximately 190,000 shares
were reserved for future issuance under the director plan.rule 10b5-1 trading plansduring the fourth quarter of 2011, executive officers timothy d. cook, peter oppenheimer, d. bruce sewell, phil schiller and jeffrey e.
williams, and directors william v. campbell and arthur d. levinson had trading plans pursuant to rule 10b5-1(c)(1) of the securities exchange act of 1934, as amended (the exchange act). a trading plan is a written document that
pre-establishes the amounts, prices and dates (or a formula for determining the amounts, prices and dates) of future purchases or sales of the companys stock, including the exercise and sale of employee stock options and shares acquired
pursuant to the companys employee stock purchase plan and upon vesting of rsus.employee stock purchase planthe employee stock purchase plan (the purchase plan) is a shareholder approved plan under which substantially all employees
may purchase the companys common stock through payroll deductions at a price equal to 85% of the lower of the fair market values of the stock as of the beginning or the end of six-month offering periods. an employees payroll deductions
under the purchase plan are limited to 10% of the employees compensation and employees may not purchase more than $25,000 of stock during any calendar year. as of september 24, 2011, approximately 3.1 million shares were reserved for
future issuance under the purchase plan.employee savings planthe employee savings plan (the savings plan) is a deferred salary arrangement under section 401(k) of the internal
revenue code. under the savings plan, participating u.s. employees may defer a portion of their pre-tax earnings, up to the irs annual contribution limit ($16,500 for calendar year 2011). the company matches 50% to 100% of each employees
contributions, depending on length of service, up to a maximum 6% of the employees eligible earnings. the companys matching contributions to the savings plan were $90 million, $72 million and $59 million in 2011, 2010 and 2009,
respectively.66

2010 and 2009, respectively. the majority of rsus that vested in 2011, 2010 and 2009, were net-share settled such that the company withheld shares with value equivalent to the employees minimum statutory obligation for the applicable income
and other employment taxes, and remitted the cash to the appropriate taxing authorities. the total shares withheld were approximately 1.6 million, 1.8 million and 707,000 for 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively, and were based on the value
of the rsus on their vesting date as determined by the companys closing stock price. total payments for the employees tax obligations to the taxing authorities were $520 million, $406 million and $82 million in 2011, 2010 and 2009,
respectively, and are reflected as a financing activity within the consolidated statements of cash flows. these net-share settlements had the effect of share repurchases by the company as they reduced and retired the number of shares that would
have otherwise been issued as a result of the vesting and did not represent an expense to the company.67

trading day of the fiscal period in excess of the weighted-average exercise price multiplied by the number of options outstanding or exercisable. total intrinsic value of options at time of exercise was $2.6 billion, $2.0 billion and $827 million
for 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.share-based compensationshare-based compensation cost for rsus is measured based on the closing fair market value of the companys common stock on the date
of grant. share-based compensation cost for stock options and employee stock purchase plan rights (stock purchase rights) is estimated at the grant date and offering date, respectively, based on the fair-value as calculated by the bsm
option-pricing model. the bsm option-pricing model incorporates various assumptions including expected volatility, expected life and interest rates. the expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of the companys common
stock over the most recent period commensurate with the expected life of the companys stock options and other relevant factors including implied volatility in market traded options on the companys common stock. the company bases its
expected life assumption on its historical experience and on the terms and conditions of the stock awards it grants to employees. the company recognizes share-based compensation cost as expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service
period.the company granted 1,370 stock options, 34,000 stock options and 234,000 stock options during 2011, 2010 and 2009,
respectively. the weighted-average grant date fair value of stock options granted during 2011, 2010 and 2009 was $181.13, $108.58 and $46.71 per share, respectively.68

the company did not assume any stock options in conjunction with business combinations
during 2011 or 2009. during 2010, the company assumed 98,000 stock options, which had a weighted-average fair value of $216.82 per share.the weighted-average fair value of stock purchase rights per share was $71.47, $45.03 and $30.62 during 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.the following table provides a summary of the share-based compensation expense included in the consolidated statements of operations for

weighted-average period of 3.7 years.note 7  commitments and contingenciesaccrued warranty and indemnificationthe company offers a basic limited parts and labor warranty on its hardware products. the basic warranty period for hardware products is typically one year from the date of purchase by the end-user. the
company also offers a 90-day basic warranty for its service parts used to repair the companys hardware products. the company provides currently for the estimated cost that may be incurred under its basic limited product warranties at the time
related revenue is recognized. factors considered in determining appropriate accruals for product warranty obligations include the size of the installed base of products subject to warranty protection, historical and projected warranty claim rates,
historical and projected cost-per-claim, and knowledge of specific product failures that are outside of the companys typical experience. the company assesses the adequacy of its pre-existing warranty liabilities and adjusts the amounts as
necessary based on actual experience and changes in future estimates.the following table reconciles changes in the
companys accrued warranty and related costs for the three years ended september 24, 2011 (in millions):beginning accrued warranty and related costscost of warranty claimsaccruals for product warrantyending accrued warranty and related coststhe company generally does not indemnify end-users of its operating system and application software
against legal claims that the software infringes third-party intellectual property rights. other agreements entered into by the company sometimes include indemnification provisions under which the company could be subject to costs and/or damages in
the event of an infringement claim against the company or an indemnified third-party. however, the company has not been required to make any significant payments resulting from such an infringement claim asserted against it or an indemnified
third-party. in the opinion of management, there was not69



at least a reasonable possibility the company may have incurred a material loss with respect to indemnification of end-users of its operating system or application software for infringement of
third-party intellectual property rights. the company did not record a liability for infringement costs related to indemnification as of either september 24, 2011 or september 25, 2010.the company has entered into indemnification agreements with its directors and executive officers. under these agreements, the company
has agreed to indemnify such individuals to the fullest extent permitted by law against liabilities that arise by reason of their status as directors or officers and to advance expenses incurred by such individuals in connection with related legal
proceedings. it is not possible to determine the maximum potential amount of payments the company could be required to make under these agreements due to the limited history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances
involved in each claim. however, the company maintains directors and officers liability insurance coverage to reduce its exposure to such obligations, and payments made under these agreements historically have not been material.concentrations in the available sources of supply of materials and productalthough most components essential to the companys business are generally available from multiple sources, a number of components
are currently obtained from single or limited sources, which subjects the company to significant supply and pricing risks. many components that are available from multiple sources are at times subject to industry-wide shortages and significant
commodity pricing fluctuations. in addition, the company has entered into various agreements for the supply of components; however there can be no guarantee that the company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms, or at
all. therefore, the company remains subject to significant risks of supply shortages and price increases that can materially adversely affect its financial condition and operating results.the company and other participants in the mobile communication and media device, and personal computer industries also compete for
various components with other industries that have experienced increased demand for their products. the company also uses some custom components that are not common to the rest of these industries, and new products introduced by the company often
utilize custom components available from only one source. when a component or product uses new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers yields have matured or manufacturing capacity has increased. if the
companys supply of components for a new or existing product were delayed or constrained, or if an outsourcing partner delayed shipments of completed products to the company, the companys financial condition and operating results could be
materially adversely affected. the companys business and financial performance could also be materially adversely affected depending on the time required to obtain sufficient quantities from the original source, or to identify and obtain
sufficient quantities from an alternative source. continued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at all, may be affected if those suppliers concentrated on the production of common components instead of components customized to
meet the companys requirements.substantially all of the companys hardware products are manufactured by
outsourcing partners that are primarily located in asia. a significant concentration of this manufacturing is currently performed by a small number of outsourcing partners, often in single locations. certain of these outsourcing partners are the
sole-sourced suppliers of components and manufacturer for many of the companys products. although the company works closely with its outsourcing partners on manufacturing schedules, the companys operating results could be adversely
affected if its outsourcing partners were unable to meet their production commitments. the companys purchase commitments typically cover its requirements for periods up to 150 days.long-term supply agreementsthe company has entered into long-term
agreements to secure the supply of certain inventory components. these agreements generally expire between 2012 and 2022. as of september 24, 2011, the company had a total of $2.3 billion of inventory component prepayments outstanding, of which
$728 million are classified as other70

current assets and $1.6 billion are classified as other assets in the consolidated balance sheets. the company had a total of $956 million of inventory component prepayments outstanding as of
september 25, 2010. the companys outstanding prepayments will be applied to certain inventory component purchases made during the term of each respective agreement.other off-balance sheet commitmentslease commitmentsthe company leases various equipment and facilities, including retail space, under noncancelable operating lease arrangements. the company
does not currently utilize any other off-balance sheet financing arrangements. the major facility leases are typically for terms not exceeding 10 years and generally provide renewal options for terms not exceeding five additional years. leases for
retail space are for terms ranging from five to 20 years, the majority of which are for ten years, and often contain multi-year renewal options. as of september 24, 2011, the companys total future minimum lease payments under
noncancelable operating leases were $3.0 billion, of which $2.4 billion related to leases for retail space.rent expense
under all operating leases, including both cancelable and noncancelable leases, was $338 million, $271 million and $231 million in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. future minimum lease payments under noncancelable operating leases having remaining

under long-term supply agreements to make additional inventory component prepayments and to acquire capital equipment, commitments to acquire product tooling and manufacturing process equipment, and commitments related to advertising, research and
development, internet and telecommunications services and other obligations.contingenciesthe company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that have arisen in the ordinary course of business and have not been fully
adjudicated, which are discussed in part i, item 3 of this form 10-k under the heading legal proceedings and in part i item 1a under the heading risk factors. in the opinion of management, there was not at least a
reasonable possibility the company may have incurred a material loss, or a material loss in excess of a recorded accrual, with respect to loss contingencies. however, the outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain. therefore, although management
considers the likelihood of such an outcome to be remote, if one or more of these legal matters were resolved against the company in the same reporting period for amounts in excess of managements expectations, the companys consolidated
financial statements of a particular reporting period could be materially adversely affected.71



note 8  segment information and geographic datathe company reports segment information based on the management approach. the management approach designates the internal
reporting used by management for making decisions and assessing performance as the source of the companys reportable segments.the company manages its business primarily on a geographic basis. accordingly, the company determined its reportable operating segments, which are generally based on the nature and location of its
customers, to be the americas, europe, japan, asia-pacific and retail operations. the results of the americas, europe, japan and asia-pacific reportable segments do not include results of the retail segment. the americas segment includes both north
and south america. the europe segment includes european countries, as well as the middle east and africa. the asia-pacific segment includes australia and asian countries, other than japan. the retail segment operates apple retail stores in 11
countries. each reportable operating segment provides similar hardware and software products and similar services. the accounting policies of the various segments are the same as those described in note 1, summary of significant accounting
policies.the company evaluates the performance of its operating segments based on net sales and operating income. net
sales for geographic segments are generally based on the location of customers, while retail segment net sales are based on sales from the companys retail stores. operating income for each segment includes net sales to third parties, related
cost of sales and operating expenses directly attributable to the segment. advertising expenses are generally included in the geographic segment in which the expenditures are incurred. operating income for each segment excludes other income and
expense and certain expenses managed outside the operating segments. costs excluded from segment operating income include various corporate expenses, such as manufacturing costs and variances not included in standard costs, research and development,
corporate marketing expenses, share-based compensation expense, income taxes, various nonrecurring charges, and other separately managed general and administrative costs. the company does not include intercompany transfers between segments for
management reporting purposes. segment assets exclude corporate assets, such as cash and cash equivalents, short-term and long-term marketable securities, other long-term investments, manufacturing and corporate facilities, product tooling and
manufacturing process equipment, miscellaneous corporate infrastructure, goodwill and other acquired intangible assets. except for the retail segment, capital asset purchases for long-lived assets are not reported to management by segment. cash
payments for capital asset purchases by the retail segment were $612 million, $392 million and $369 million for 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.the company has certain retail stores that have been designed and built to serve as high-profile venues to promote brand awareness and serve as vehicles for corporate sales and marketing activities.
because of their unique design elements, locations and size, these stores require substantially more investment than the companys more typical retail stores. the company allocates certain operating expenses associated with its high-profile
stores to corporate expense to reflect the estimated company-wide benefit. the allocation of these operating costs to corporate expense is based on the amount incurred for a high-profile store in excess of that incurred by a more typical company
retail location. the company had opened a total of 19 high-profile stores as of september 24, 2011. amounts allocated to corporate expense resulting from the operations of high-profile stores were $102 million, $75 million and $65 million for
2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.72

our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.we conducted our audits in
accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board (united states). those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. an audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. an audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as
well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. we believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.in our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of apple inc. at september 24, 2011 and september 25,
2010, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended september 24, 2011, in conformity with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles.we also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board (united states), apple

report of ernst & young llp, independent registered public accounting firmthe board of directors and shareholders of apple inc.we have audited apple inc.s internal control over financial reporting as of september 24, 2011, based on criteria established in internal control  integrated framework issued by
the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission (the coso criteria). apple inc.s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the
effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying managements annual report on internal control over financial reporting. our responsibility is to express an opinion on the companys internal control
over financial reporting based on our audit.we conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the public company
accounting oversight board (united states). those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. our
audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk,
and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. we believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.a companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. a companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that,
in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance
regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. also, projections
of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.in our opinion, apple inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of
september 24, 2011, based on the coso criteria.we also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the public
company accounting oversight board (united states), the 2011 consolidated financial statements of apple inc. and our report dated october 26, 2011 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon./s/ ernst & young llpsan jose, californiaoctober 26, 201177

financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with gaap. the companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that:pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the
companys assets;provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with gaap, and
that the companys receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of the companys management and directors; andprovide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets
that could have a material effect on the financial statements.management, including the companys
chief executive officer and chief financial officer, does not expect that the companys internal controls will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. a control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable,
not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs.
because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of internal controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. also, any evaluation of the effectiveness of
controls in future periods are subject to the risk that those internal controls may become inadequate because of changes in business conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.managements annual report on internal control over financial reportingthe companys management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as
defined in rule 13a-15(f) under the exchange act. management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the companys internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria set forth in internal control  integrated framework
issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission (coso). based on the companys assessment, management has concluded that its internal control over financial reporting was effective as of
september 24, 2011 to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles. the companys independent
registered public accounting firm, ernst & young llp, has issued an audit report on the companys internal control over financial reporting, which appears in item 15(a) of this annual report on form 10-k.78

## Item 1A


global markets for the companys products and services are highly competitive and subject
to rapid technological change, and the company may be unable to compete effectively in these markets.the companys products and
services compete in highly competitive global markets characterized by aggressive price cutting and resulting downward pressure on gross margins, frequent introduction of new products, short product life cycles, evolving industry standards,
continual improvement in product price/performance characteristics, rapid adoption of technological and product advancements by competitors and price sensitivity on the part of consumers.the companys ability to compete successfully depends heavily on its ability to ensure a continuing and timely introduction of innovative new
products and technologies to the marketplace. the company believes it is unique in that it designs and develops nearly the entire solution for its products, including the hardware, operating system, numerous software applications and related
services. as a result, the company must make significant investments in r&d. the company currently holds a significant number of patents and copyrights and has registered and/or has applied to register numerous patents, trademarks and service
marks. in contrast, many of the companys competitors seek to compete primarily through aggressive pricing and very low cost structures, and emulating the companys products and infringing on its intellectual property.
if the company is unable to continue to develop and sell innovative new products with attractive margins or if competitors infringe on the companys intellectual property, the companys ability to maintain a competitive advantage could be
adversely affected.the company markets certain mobile communication and media devices based on the ios mobile operating system and also markets
related third-party digital content and applications. the company faces substantial competition in these markets from companies that have significant technical, marketing, distribution and other resources, as well as established hardware, software
and digital content supplier relationships; and the company has a minority market share in the smartphone market. additionally, the company faces significant price competition as competitors reduce their selling prices and attempt to imitate the
companys product features and applications within their own products or, alternatively, collaborate with each other to offer solutions that are more competitive than those they currently offer. the company also competes with illegitimate ways
to obtain third-party digital content and applications and with business models that include content provided to users for free. some of the companys competitors have greater experience, product breadth and distribution channels than the
company. because some current and potential competitors have substantial resources and/or experience and a lower cost structure, they may be able to provide products and services at little or no profit or even at a loss. the company also expects
competition to intensify as competitors attempt to imitate the companys approach to providing components seamlessly within their individual offerings or work collaboratively to offer integrated solutions. the companys financial condition
and operating results depend substantially on the companys ability to continually improve ios and ios devices in order to maintain their functional and design advantages.the company is the only authorized maker of hardware using os x, which has a minority market share in the personal computer market. this market has been
contracting and is dominated by computer makers using competing operating systems, most notably windows. in the market for personal computers and accessories, the company faces a significant number of competitors, many of which have broader product
lines, lower priced products and a larger installed customer base. historically, consolidation in this market has resulted in larger competitors. price competition has been particularly intense as competitors selling windows-based personal computers
have aggressively cut prices and lowered product margins. an increasing number of internet-enabled devices that include software applications and are smaller and simpler than traditional personal computers compete for market share with the
companys existing products. the companys financial condition and operating results also depend on its ability to continually improve the mac platform to maintain its functional and design advantages.there can be no assurance the company will be able to continue to provide products and services that compete effectively.apple inc. | 2014 form 10-k | 10



to remain competitive and stimulate customer demand, the company must successfully manage
frequent product introductions and transitions.due to the highly volatile and competitive nature of the industries in which the company
competes, the company must continually introduce new products, services and technologies, enhance existing products and services, and effectively stimulate customer demand for new and upgraded products. the success of new product introductions
depends on a number of factors including, but not limited to, timely and successful product development, market acceptance, the companys ability to manage the risks associated with new product production ramp-up issues, the availability of
application software for new products, the effective management of purchase commitments and inventory levels in line with anticipated product demand, the availability of products in appropriate quantities and at expected costs to meet anticipated
demand, and the risk that new products may have quality or other defects or deficiencies in the early stages of introduction. accordingly, the company cannot determine in advance the ultimate effect of new product introductions and transitions.the company depends on the performance of distributors, carriers and other resellers.the company distributes its products through cellular network carriers, wholesalers, national and regional retailers, and value-added resellers, many of
whom distribute products from competing manufacturers. the company also sells its products and third-party products in most of its major markets directly to education, enterprise and government customers, and consumers and small and mid-sized
businesses through its online and retail stores.carriers providing cellular network service for iphone typically subsidize users purchases of
the device. there is no assurance that such subsidies will be continued at all or in the same amounts upon renewal of the companys agreements with these carriers or in agreements the company enters into with new carriers.many resellers have narrow operating margins and have been adversely affected in the past by weak economic conditions. some resellers have perceived the
expansion of the companys direct sales as conflicting with their business interests as distributors and resellers of the companys products. such a perception could discourage resellers from investing resources in the distribution and
sale of the companys products or lead them to limit or cease distribution of those products. the company has invested and will continue to invest in programs to enhance reseller sales, including staffing selected resellers stores with
company employees and contractors, and improving product placement displays. these programs could require a substantial investment while providing no assurance of return or incremental revenue. the financial condition of these resellers could
weaken, these resellers could stop distributing the companys products, or uncertainty regarding demand for the companys products could cause resellers to reduce their ordering and marketing of the companys products.the company faces substantial inventory and other asset risk in addition to purchase commitment cancellation risk.the company records a write-down for product and component inventories that have become obsolete or exceed anticipated demand or net realizable value and
accrues necessary cancellation fee reserves for orders of excess products and components. the company also reviews its long-lived assets, including capital assets held at its suppliers facilities and inventory prepayments, for impairment
whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. if the company determines that impairment has occurred, it records a write-down equal to the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds
its fair value. although the company believes its provisions related to inventory, capital assets, inventory prepayments and other assets and purchase commitments are currently adequate, no assurance can be given that the company will not incur
additional related charges given the rapid and unpredictable pace of product obsolescence in the industries in which the company competes.the
company must order components for its products and build inventory in advance of product announcements and shipments. consistent with industry practice, components are normally acquired through a combination of purchase orders, supplier contracts
and open orders, in each case based on projected demand. where appropriate, the purchases are applied to inventory component prepayments that are outstanding with the respective supplier. purchase commitments typically
cover forecasted component and manufacturing requirements for periods up to 150 days. because the companys markets are volatile, competitive and subject to rapid technology and price changes, there is a risk the company will forecast
incorrectly and order or produce excess or insufficient amounts of components or products, or not fully utilize firm purchase commitments.apple inc. | 2014 form 10-k | 11



future operating results depend upon the companys ability to obtain components in
sufficient quantities.because the company currently obtains components from single or limited sources, the company is subject to significant
supply and pricing risks. many components, including those that are available from multiple sources, are at times subject to industry-wide shortages and significant commodity pricing fluctuations. while the company has entered into agreements for
the supply of many components, there can be no assurance that the company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms, or at all. a number of suppliers of components may suffer from poor financial conditions, which can lead to
business failure for the supplier or consolidation within a particular industry, further limiting the companys ability to obtain sufficient quantities of components. the follow-on effects from global economic conditions on the
companys suppliers, described in global and regional economic conditions could materially adversely affect the company above, also could affect the companys ability to obtain components. therefore, the company
remains subject to significant risks of supply shortages and price increases.the company and other participants in the markets for mobile
communication and media devices and personal computers also compete for various components with other industries that have experienced increased demand for their products. the company uses some custom components that are not common to the rest of
these industries. the companys new products often utilize custom components available from only one source. when a component or product uses new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers yields have matured
or manufacturing capacity has increased. continued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at all, may be affected if those suppliers decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to
meet the companys requirements. the supply of components for a new or existing product could be delayed or constrained, or a key manufacturing vendor could delay shipments of completed products to the company.the company depends on component and product manufacturing and logistical services provided by outsourcing partners, many of whom are
located outside of the u.s.substantially all of the companys manufacturing is performed in whole or in part by a few outsourcing
partners located primarily in asia. the company has also outsourced much of its transportation and logistics management. while these arrangements may lower operating costs, they also reduce the companys direct control over production and
distribution. it is uncertain what effect such diminished control will have on the quality or quantity of products or services, or the companys flexibility to respond to changing conditions. although arrangements with these partners may
contain provisions for warranty expense reimbursement, the company may remain responsible to the consumer for warranty service in the event of product defects and could experience an unanticipated product defect or warranty liability. while the
company relies on its partners to adhere to its supplier code of conduct, material violations of the supplier code of conduct could occur.the
company relies on sole-sourced outsourcing partners in the u.s., asia and europe to supply and manufacture many critical components, and on outsourcing partners primarily located in asia, for final assembly of substantially all of the companys
hardware products. any failure of these partners to perform may have a negative impact on the companys cost or supply of components or finished goods. in addition, manufacturing or logistics in these locations or transit to final destinations
may be disrupted for a variety of reasons including, but not limited to, natural and man-made disasters, information technology system failures, commercial disputes, military actions or economic, business, labor, environmental, public health, or
political issues.the company has invested in manufacturing process equipment, much of which is held at certain of its outsourcing partners, and has
made prepayments to certain of its suppliers associated with long-term supply agreements. while these arrangements help ensure the supply of components and finished goods, if these outsourcing partners or suppliers experience severe financial
problems or other disruptions in their business, the net realizable value of these assets could be negatively impacted.the
companys products and services may experience quality problems from time to time that can result in decreased sales and operating margin and harm to the companys reputation.the company sells complex hardware and software products and services that can contain design and manufacturing defects. sophisticated operating system
software and applications, such as those sold by the company, often contain bugs that can unexpectedly interfere with the softwares intended operation. the companys online services may from time to time experience outages,
service slowdowns, or errors. defects may also occur in components and products the company purchases from third parties. there can be no assurance the company will be able to detect and fix all defects in the hardware, software and services it
sells. failure to do so could result in lost revenue, significant warranty and other expenses and harm to the companys reputation.apple inc. | 2014 form 10-k | 12



the company relies on access to third-party digital content, which may not be available to the
company on commercially reasonable terms or at all.the company contracts with numerous third parties to offer their digital content through
the itunes store. this includes the right to make available music, movies, tv shows and books currently available through the itunes store. the licensing or other distribution arrangements with these third parties are for relatively short terms and
do not guarantee the continuation or renewal of these arrangements on reasonable terms, if at all. some third-party content providers and distributors currently or in the future may offer competing products and services, and could take action to
make it more difficult or impossible for the company to license or otherwise distribute their content in the future. other content owners, providers or distributors may seek to limit the companys access to, or increase the cost of, such
content. the company may be unable to continue to offer a wide variety of content at reasonable prices with acceptable usage rules, or continue to expand its geographic reach. failure to obtain the right to make available third-party digital
content, or to make available such content on commercially reasonable terms, could have a material adverse impact on the companys financial condition and operating results.some third-party digital content providers require the company to provide digital rights management and other security solutions. if requirements change,
the company may have to develop or license new technology to provide these solutions. there is no assurance the company will be able to develop or license such solutions at a reasonable cost and in a timely manner. in addition, certain countries
have passed or may propose and adopt legislation that would force the company to license its digital rights management, which could lessen the protection of content and subject it to piracy and also could negatively affect arrangements with the
companys content providers.the companys future performance depends in part on support from
third-party software developers.the company believes decisions by customers to purchase its hardware
products depend in part on the availability of third-party software applications and services. there is no assurance that third-party developers will continue to develop and maintain software applications and
services for the companys products. if third-party software applications and services cease to be developed and maintained for the companys products, customers may choose not to buy the companys products.with respect to its mac products, the company believes the availability of third-party software applications and
services depends in part on the developers perception and analysis of the relative benefits of developing, maintaining and upgrading such software for the companys products compared to windows-based products. this analysis may be based
on factors such as the market position of the company and its products, the anticipated revenue that may be generated, expected future growth of mac sales and the costs of developing such applications and services. if the companys minority
share of the global personal computer market causes developers to question the macs prospects, developers could be less inclined to develop or upgrade software for the companys mac products and more inclined to devote their resources to
developing and upgrading software for the larger windows market.with respect to ios devices, the company relies on the continued availability and
development of compelling and innovative software applications, which are distributed through a single distribution channel, the app store. ios devices are subject to rapid technological change, and, if third-party developers are unable to or choose
not to keep up with this pace of change, third-party applications might not successfully operate and may result in dissatisfied customers. as with applications for the companys mac products, the availability and development of these
applications also depend on developers perceptions and analysis of the relative benefits of developing software for the companys ios devices rather than its competitors platforms, such as android. if developers focus their efforts
on these competing platforms, the availability and quality of applications for the companys ios devices may suffer.the company
relies on access to third-party intellectual property, which may not be available to the company on commercially reasonable terms or at all.many of the companys products include third-party intellectual property, which requires licenses from those third parties. based on past experience
and industry practice, the company believes such licenses generally can be obtained on reasonable terms. there is, however, no assurance that the necessary licenses can be obtained on acceptable terms or at all. failure to obtain the right to use
third-party intellectual property, or to use such intellectual property on commercially reasonable terms, could preclude the company from selling certain products or otherwise have a material adverse impact on the companys financial condition
and operating results.apple inc. | 2014 form 10-k | 13



the company could be impacted by unfavorable results of legal proceedings, such as being found
to have infringed on intellectual property rights.the company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that have not yet been
fully resolved and that have arisen in the ordinary course of business, and additional claims may arise in the future.for example, technology
companies, including many of the companys competitors, frequently enter into litigation based on allegations of patent infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. in addition, patent holding companies seek to monetize
patents they have purchased or otherwise obtained. as the company has grown, the intellectual property rights claims against it have increased and may continue to increase. in particular, the companys cellular enabled products compete with
mobile communication and media device companies that hold significant patent portfolios, and the number of patent claims against the company has significantly increased. the company is vigorously defending infringement actions in courts in a
number of u.s. jurisdictions and before the u.s. international trade commission, as well as internationally in various countries. the plaintiffs in these actions frequently seek injunctions and substantial damages.regardless of the scope or validity of such patents or other intellectual property rights, or the merits of any claims by potential or actual
litigants, the company may have to engage in protracted litigation. if the company is found to infringe one or more patents or other intellectual property rights, regardless of whether it can develop non-infringing technology, it may be required to
pay substantial damages or royalties to a third-party, or it may be subject to a temporary or permanent injunction prohibiting the company from marketing or selling certain products.in certain cases, the company may consider the desirability of entering into licensing agreements, although no assurance can be given that such licenses
can be obtained on acceptable terms or that litigation will not occur. these licenses may also significantly increase the companys operating expenses.regardless of the merit of particular claims, litigation may be expensive, time-consuming, disruptive to the companys operations and distracting to
management. in recognition of these considerations, the company may enter into arrangements to settle litigation.in managements opinion,
there is not at least a reasonable possibility the company may have incurred a material loss, or a material loss in excess of a recorded accrual, with respect to loss contingencies, including matters related to infringement of intellectual property
rights. however, the outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain.although management considers the likelihood of such an outcome to be remote, if
one or more legal matters were resolved against the company in a reporting period for amounts in excess of managements expectations, the companys consolidated financial statements for that reporting period could be materially adversely
affected. further, such an outcome could result in significant compensatory, punitive or trebled monetary damages, disgorgement of revenue or profits, remedial corporate measures or injunctive relief against the company that could materially
adversely affect its financial condition and operating results.the company is subject to laws and regulations worldwide, changes to
which could increase the companys costs and individually or in the aggregate adversely affect the companys business.the company
is subject to laws and regulations affecting its domestic and international operations in a number of areas. these u.s. and foreign laws and regulations affect the companys activities including, but not limited to, in areas of labor,
advertising, digital content, consumer protection, real estate, billing, e-commerce, promotions, quality of services, telecommunications, mobile communications and media, television, intellectual property ownership and infringement, tax, import and
export requirements, anti-corruption, foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions, data privacy requirements, anti-competition, environmental, health and safety.apple inc. | 2014 form 10-k | 14



by way of example, laws and regulations related to mobile communications and media devices in the many
jurisdictions in which the company operates are extensive and subject to change. such changes could include, among others, restrictions on the production, manufacture, distribution and use of devices, locking devices to a carriers network, or
mandating the use of devices on more than one carriers network. these devices are also subject to certification and regulation by governmental and standardization bodies, as well as by cellular network carriers for use on their
networks. these certification processes are extensive and time consuming, and could result in additional testing requirements, product modifications, or delays in product shipment dates, or could preclude the company from selling certain
products.compliance with these laws, regulations and similar requirements may be onerous and expensive, and they may be inconsistent from
jurisdiction to jurisdiction, further increasing the cost of compliance and doing business. any such costs, which may rise in the future as a result of changes in these laws and regulations or in their interpretation, could individually or in the
aggregate make the companys products and services less attractive to the companys customers, delay the introduction of new products in one or more regions, or cause the company to change or limit its business practices. the company has
implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations, but there can be no assurance that the companys employees, contractors, or agents will not violate such laws and regulations or the
companys policies and procedures.the companys business is subject to the risks of international operations.the company derives a significant portion of its revenue and earnings from its international operations. compliance with applicable u.s. and foreign laws
and regulations, such as import and export requirements, anti-corruption laws, tax laws, foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions, data privacy requirements, environmental laws, labor laws and anti-competition regulations,
increases the costs of doing business in foreign jurisdictions. although the company has implemented policies and procedures to comply with these laws and regulations, a violation by the companys employees, contractors, or agents could
nevertheless occur.the company also could be significantly affected by other risks associated with international activities including, but not
limited to, economic and labor conditions, increased duties, taxes and other costs and political instability. margins on sales of the companys products in foreign countries, and on sales of products that include components obtained from
foreign suppliers, could be materially adversely affected by international trade regulations, including duties, tariffs and antidumping penalties. the company is also exposed to credit and collectability risk on its trade receivables with customers
in certain international markets. there can be no assurance the company can effectively limit its credit risk and avoid losses.the
companys retail segment has required and will continue to require a substantial investment and commitment of resources and is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties.the companys retail stores have required substantial investment in equipment and leasehold improvements, information systems, inventory and
personnel. the company also has entered into substantial operating lease commitments for retail space. certain stores have been designed and built to serve as high-profile venues to promote brand awareness and serve as vehicles for corporate sales
and marketing activities. because of their unique design elements, locations and size, these stores require substantially more investment than the companys more typical retail stores. due to the high cost structure associated with the retail
segment, a decline in sales or the closure or poor performance of individual or multiple stores could result in significant lease termination costs, write-offs of equipment and leasehold improvements, and severance costs.many factors unique to retail operations, some of which are beyond the companys control, pose risks and uncertainties. these risks and
uncertainties include, but are not limited to, macro-economic factors that could have an adverse effect on general retail activity, as well as the companys inability to manage costs associated with store construction and operation, the
companys failure to manage relationships with its existing retail partners, more challenging environments in managing retail operations outside the u.s., costs associated with unanticipated fluctuations in the value of retail inventory, and
the companys inability to obtain and renew leases in quality retail locations at a reasonable cost.apple inc. | 2014 form 10-k | 15



investment in new business strategies and acquisitions could disrupt the companys ongoing
business and present risks not originally contemplated.the company has invested, and in the future may invest, in new business strategies or
acquisitions. such endeavors may involve significant risks and uncertainties, including distraction of management from current operations, greater than expected liabilities and expenses, inadequate return of capital and unidentified issues not
discovered in the companys due diligence. these new ventures are inherently risky and may not be successful.the companys
business and reputation may be impacted by information technology system failures or network disruptions.the company may be subject to
information technology system failures and network disruptions. these may be caused by natural disasters, accidents, power disruptions, telecommunications failures, acts of terrorism or war, computer viruses, physical or electronic break-ins, or
other events or disruptions. system redundancy may be ineffective or inadequate, and the companys disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities. such failures or disruptions could prevent access to the companys
online stores and services, preclude retail store transactions, compromise company or customer data, and result in delayed or cancelled orders. system failures and disruptions could also impede the manufacturing and shipping of products, delivery of
online services, transactions processing and financial reporting.there may be breaches of the companys information technology
systems that materially damage business partner and customer relationships, curtail or otherwise adversely impact access to online stores and services, or subject the company to significant reputational, financial, legal and operational
consequences.the companys business requires it to use and store customer, employee and business partner personally identifiable
information (pii). this may include, among other information, names, addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, contact preferences, tax identification numbers and payment account information. although malicious attacks to gain access to
pii affect many companies across various industries, the company is at a relatively greater risk of being targeted because of its high profile and the amount of pii it manages.the company requires user names and passwords in order to access its information technology systems. the company also uses encryption and authentication
technologies designed to secure the transmission and storage of data and prevent access to company data or accounts. as with all companies, these security measures are subject to third-party security breaches, employee error, malfeasance, faulty
password management, or other irregularities. for example, third parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees or customers into disclosing user names, passwords or other sensitive information, which may in turn be used to access the
companys information technology systems. to help protect customers and the company, the company monitors accounts and systems for unusual activity and may freeze accounts under suspicious circumstances, which may result in the delay or loss of
customer orders.the company devotes significant resources to network security, data encryption and other security measures to protect its systems
and data, but these security measures cannot provide absolute security. to the extent the company was to experience a breach of its systems and was unable to protect sensitive data, such a breach could materially damage business partner and customer
relationships, and curtail or otherwise adversely impact access to online stores and services. moreover, if a computer security breach affects the companys systems or results in the unauthorized release of pii, the companys reputation
and brand could be materially damaged, use of the companys products and services could decrease, and the company could be exposed to a risk of loss or litigation and possible liability. while the company maintains insurance coverage that,
subject to policy terms and conditions and subject to a significant self-insured retention, is designed to address certain aspects of cyber risks, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise
in the continually evolving area of cyber risk.apple inc. | 2014 form 10-k | 16



the companys business is subject to a variety of u.s. and international laws, rules,
policies and other obligations regarding data protection.the company is subject to federal, state and international laws relating to the
collection, use, retention, security and transfer of pii. in many cases, these laws apply not only to third-party transactions, but also to transfers of information between the company and its subsidiaries, and among the company, its subsidiaries
and other parties with which the company has commercial relations. several jurisdictions have passed laws in this area, and other jurisdictions are considering imposing additional restrictions. these laws continue to develop and may be inconsistent
from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. complying with emerging and changing international requirements may cause the company to incur substantial costs or require the company to change its business practices. noncompliance could result in penalties or
significant legal liability.the companys privacy policy, which includes related practices concerning the use and disclosure of data, is
posted on its website. any failure by the company, its suppliers or other parties with whom the company does business to comply with its posted privacy policy or with other federal, state or international privacy-related or data protection laws and
regulations could result in proceedings against the company by governmental entities or others.the company is also subject to payment card
association rules and obligations under its contracts with payment card processors. under these rules and obligations, if information is compromised, the company could be liable to payment card issuers for associated expenses and penalties. in
addition, if the company fails to follow payment card industry security standards, even if no customer information is compromised, the company could incur significant fines or experience a significant increase in payment card transaction costs.the companys success depends largely on the continued service and availability of key personnel.much of the companys future success depends on the continued availability and service of key personnel, including its chief executive officer,
executive team and other highly skilled employees. experienced personnel in the technology industry are in high demand and competition for their talents is intense, especially in silicon valley, where most of the companys key personnel are
located.the companys business may be impacted by political events, war, terrorism, public health issues, natural disasters and
other business interruptions.war, terrorism, geopolitical uncertainties, public health issues and other business interruptions have caused
and could cause damage or disruption to international commerce and the global economy, and thus could have a material adverse effect on the company, its suppliers, logistics providers, manufacturing vendors and customers, including channel partners.
the companys business operations are subject to interruption by, among others, natural disasters, whether as a result of climate change or otherwise, fire, power shortages, nuclear power plant accidents, terrorist attacks and other hostile
acts, labor disputes, public health issues and other events beyond its control. such events could decrease demand for the companys products, make it difficult or impossible for the company to make and deliver products to its customers,
including channel partners, or to receive components from its suppliers, and create delays and inefficiencies in the companys supply chain. should major public health issues, including pandemics, arise, the company could be adversely affected
by more stringent employee travel restrictions, additional limitations in freight services, governmental actions limiting the movement of products between regions, delays in production ramps of new products and disruptions in the operations of the
companys manufacturing vendors and component suppliers. the majority of the companys r&d activities, its corporate headquarters, information technology systems and other critical business operations, including certain component
suppliers and manufacturing vendors, are in locations that could be affected by natural disasters. in the event of a natural disaster, the company could incur significant losses, require substantial recovery time and experience significant
expenditures in order to resume operations.apple inc. | 2014 form 10-k | 17



the company expects its quarterly revenue and operating results to fluctuate.the companys profit margins vary across its products and distribution channels. the companys software, accessories, and service and support
contracts generally have higher gross margins than certain of the companys other products. gross margins on the companys hardware products vary across product lines and can change over time as a result of product transitions, pricing and
configuration changes, and component, warranty, and other cost fluctuations. the companys direct sales generally have higher associated gross margins than its indirect sales through its channel partners. in addition, the companys gross
margin and operating margin percentages, as well as overall profitability, may be materially adversely impacted as a result of a shift in product, geographic or channel mix, component cost increases, the strengthening u.s. dollar, price competition,
or the introduction of new products, including those that have higher cost structures with flat or reduced pricing.the company has typically
experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters due in part to seasonal holiday demand. additionally, new product introductions can significantly impact net sales, product costs and operating expenses. the company could
be subject to unexpected developments late in a quarter, such as lower-than-anticipated demand for the companys products, issues with new product introductions, an internal systems failure, or failure of one of the companys logistics,
components supply, or manufacturing partners.the companys stock price is subject to volatility.the companys stock price has experienced substantial price volatility in the past and may continue to do so in the future. additionally, the
company, the technology industry and the stock market as a whole have experienced extreme stock price and volume fluctuations that have affected stock prices in ways that may have been unrelated to these companies operating performance. price
volatility over a given period may cause the average price at which the company repurchases its own stock to exceed the stocks price at a given point in time. the company believes its stock price reflects expectations of future growth and
profitability. the company also believes its stock price reflects expectations that its cash dividend will continue at current levels or grow and that its current share repurchase program will be fully consummated. future dividends are subject to
declaration by the companys board of directors, and the companys share repurchase program does not obligate it to acquire any specific number of shares. if the company fails to meet any of these expectations related to future growth,
profitability, dividends, share repurchases or other market expectations, its stock price may decline significantly, which could have a material adverse impact on investor confidence and employee retention.the companys financial performance is subject to risks associated with changes in the value of the u.s. dollar versus local
currencies.the companys primary exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates relates to non-u.s. dollar denominated sales
and operating expenses worldwide. weakening of foreign currencies relative to the u.s. dollar adversely affects the u.s. dollar value of the companys foreign currency-denominated sales and earnings, and generally leads the company to raise
international pricing, potentially reducing demand for the companys products. margins on sales of the companys products in foreign countries and on sales of products that include components obtained from foreign suppliers, could be
materially adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. in some circumstances, for competitive or other reasons, the company may decide not to raise local prices to fully offset the dollars strengthening, or at all, which
would adversely affect the u.s. dollar value of the companys foreign currency denominated sales and earnings. conversely, a strengthening of foreign currencies relative to the u.s. dollar, while generally beneficial to the companys
foreign currency-denominated sales and earnings, could cause the company to reduce international pricing and incur losses on its foreign currency derivative instruments, thereby limiting the benefit. additionally, strengthening of foreign currencies
may also increase the companys cost of product components denominated in those currencies, thus adversely affecting gross margins.the company
uses derivative instruments, such as foreign currency forward and option contracts, to hedge certain exposures to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. the use of such hedging activities may not offset any, or more than a portion, of the
adverse financial effects of unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates over the limited time the hedges are in place.apple inc. | 2014 form 10-k | 18



the company is exposed to credit risk and fluctuations in the market values of its investment
portfolio.given the global nature of its business, the company has both domestic and international investments. credit ratings and pricing
of the companys investments can be negatively affected by liquidity, credit deterioration, financial results, economic risk, political risk, sovereign risk or other factors. as a result, the value and liquidity of the companys cash, cash
equivalents and marketable securities may fluctuate substantially. therefore, although the company has not realized any significant losses on its cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, future fluctuations in their value could result in a
significant realized loss.the company is exposed to credit risk on its trade accounts receivable, vendor non-trade receivables and
prepayments related to long-term supply agreements, and this risk is heightened during periods when economic conditions worsen.the company
distributes its products through third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers and value-added resellers. the company also sells its products directly to small and mid-sized businesses and education, enterprise and government
customers. a substantial majority of the companys outstanding trade receivables are not covered by collateral, third-party financing arrangements or credit insurance. the companys exposure to credit and collectability risk on its trade
receivables is higher in certain international markets and its ability to mitigate such risks may be limited. the company also has unsecured vendor non-trade receivables resulting from purchases of components by outsourcing partners and other
vendors that manufacture sub-assemblies or assemble final products for the company. in addition, the company has made prepayments associated with long-term supply agreements to secure supply of inventory components. as of september 27, 2014, a
significant portion of the companys trade receivables was concentrated within cellular network carriers, and its vendor non-trade receivables and prepayments related to long-term supply agreements were concentrated among a few individual
vendors located primarily in asia. while the company has procedures to monitor and limit exposure to credit risk on its trade and vendor non-trade receivables, as well as long-term prepayments, there can be no assurance such procedures will
effectively limit its credit risk and avoid losses.the company could be subject to changes in its tax rates, the adoption of new u.s.
or international tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities.the company is subject to taxes in the u.s. and numerous foreign
jurisdictions, including ireland, where a number of the companys subsidiaries are organized. due to economic and political conditions, tax rates in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change. the companys future effective
tax rates could be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, or changes in tax laws or their interpretation, including in the u.s. and
ireland. for example, in june 2014, the european commission opened a formal investigation to examine whether decisions by the tax authorities in ireland with regard to the corporate income tax to be paid by two of the companys irish
subsidiaries comply with european union rules on state aid. if the european commission were to take a final decision against ireland, it could require changes to existing tax rulings that, in turn, could increase the companys taxes in the
future. the european commission could also require ireland to recover from the company past taxes reflective of the disallowed state aid.the
company is also subject to the examination of its tax returns and other tax matters by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities and governmental bodies. the company regularly assesses the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from
these examinations to determine the adequacy of its provision for taxes. there can be no assurance as to the outcome of these examinations. if the companys effective tax rates were to increase, particularly in the u.s. or ireland, or if the
ultimate determination of the companys taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued, the companys operating results, cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected.none.apple inc. | 2014 form 10-k | 19

utilized $23.0 billion to repurchase common shares and paid dividends of $10.5 billion or $1.64 per common share. in conjunction with its capital return program, in may 2013 the company issued $17.0 billion of long-term debt with varying maturities

sales grew in all segments except rest of asia pacific. overall average selling prices (asps) for iphone were relatively flat in 2014 compared to 2013, with growth in asps in the americas and retail segments being offset by a decline in

increases in net sales and unit sales of iphone during 2013 compared to 2012. the year-over-year impact of higher iphone unit sales in 2013 was partially offset by a 3% decline in iphone asps primarily as a result of a shift in product mix towards

introductions in the first half of 2013 and increased sales of services. with an average of 403 and 365 open stores during 2013 and 2012, respectively, average revenue per store decreased to $50.2 million in 2013, compared to $51.5 million in 2012.the retail segments operating income was $4.6 billion, $4.0 billion and $4.6 billion during 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. the
year-over-year increase in retail segment operating income in 2014 was attributable to higher net sales and higher gross margin primarily due to a higher mix of iphone. the year-over-year decrease in retail segment operating income in 2013 was

reductions on select products and higher cost structures on certain new products.the year-over-year decrease in gross margin in 2013 compared to
2012 was driven by multiple factors including introduction of new versions of existing products with higher cost structures and flat or reduced pricing; a shift in sales mix to products with lower margins; introduction of ipad mini with gross margin
significantly below the companys average product margins; higher expenses associated with changes to certain of the companys service policies and other warranty costs; price reductions on certain products, including ipad 2 and iphone 4;

the company anticipates gross margin during the first quarter of 2015 to be between 37.5% and 38.5%. the
foregoing statement regarding the companys expected gross margin percentage in the first quarter of 2015 is forward-looking and could differ from actual results. the companys future gross margins can be impacted by multiple factors
including, but not limited to those set forth above in part i, item 1a of this form 10-k under the heading risk factors and those described in this paragraph. in general, the company believes gross margins will remain under downward
pressure due to a variety of factors, including continued industry wide global product pricing pressures, increased competition, compressed product life cycles, product transitions, potential increases in the cost of components and potential
strengthening of the u.s. dollar, as well as potential increases in the costs of outside manufacturing services and a potential shift in the companys sales mix towards products with lower gross margins. in response to competitive pressures,
the company expects it will continue to take product pricing actions, which would adversely affect gross margins. gross margins could also be affected by the companys ability to manage product quality and warranty costs effectively and to
stimulate demand for certain of its products. due to the companys significant international operations, financial results can be significantly affected by fluctuations in exchange rates.operating expensesoperating expenses for 2014, 2013 and 2012

company began accessing the commercial paper markets in the third quarter of 2014. the company currently anticipates the cash used for future dividends and the share repurchase program will come from its current domestic cash, cash generated from
on-going u.s. operating activities and from borrowings.as of september 27, 2014 and september 28, 2013, $137.1 billion and $111.3
billion, respectively, of the companys cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities were held by foreign subsidiaries and are generally based in u.s. dollar-denominated holdings. amounts held by
foreign subsidiaries are generally subject to u.s. income taxation on repatriation to the u.s. the companys marketable securities investment portfolio is invested primarily in highly-rated securities and its investment policy generally limits
the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. the policy requires investments generally to be investment grade with the objective of minimizing the potential risk of principal loss.during 2014, cash generated from operating activities of $59.7 billion was a result of $39.5 billion of net income, non-cash adjustments to net income of
$13.2 billion and an increase in net change in operating assets and liabilities of $7.0 billion. cash used in investing activities of $22.6 billion during 2014 consisted primarily of cash used for purchases of marketable securities, net of sales and
maturities, of $9.0 billion; cash used to acquire property, plant and equipment of $9.6 billion; and cash paid for business acquisitions, net of cash acquired, of $3.8 billion. cash used in financing activities of $37.5 billion during 2014 consisted
primarily of cash used to repurchase common stock of $45.0 billion and cash used to pay dividends and dividend equivalents of $11.1 billion, partially offset by net proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt and commercial paper of $12.0
billion and $6.3 billion, respectively.during 2013, cash generated from operating activities of $53.7 billion was a result of $37.0 billion of net
income, non-cash adjustments to net income of $10.2 billion and an increase in net change in operating assets and liabilities of $6.5 billion. cash used in investing activities of $33.8 billion during 2013 consisted primarily of cash used for

capital assetsthe companys capital expenditures were $11.0 billion during 2014, consisting of $491 million for retail store facilities and $10.5 billion for other
capital expenditures, including product tooling and manufacturing process equipment and other corporate facilities and infrastructure. the companys actual cash payments for capital expenditures during 2014 were $9.6 billion.the company anticipates utilizing approximately $13.0 billion for capital expenditures during 2015, including approximately $600 million for retail store
facilities and approximately $12.4 billion for other capital expenditures, including product tooling and manufacturing process equipment, data centers and corporate facilities and infrastructure, including information systems hardware, software and
enhancements.during 2015, the company expects to open about 25 new retail stores, with approximately three-quarters located outside of the u.s.
during 2015, the company also expects to remodel approximately five of its existing stores.debtin april 2014, the board of directors authorized the company to issue unsecured short-term promissory notes (commercial paper) pursuant to a
commercial paper program. the company intends to use the net proceeds from the commercial paper program for general corporate purposes, including dividends and share repurchases. as of september 27, 2014, the company had $6.3 billion of
commercial paper outstanding, with a weighted-average interest rate of 0.12% and maturities generally less than nine months.in the third quarter of
2014 and 2013, the company issued $12.0 billion and $17.0 billion of long-term debt, respectively. the debt issuances included floating- and fixed-rate notes with varying maturities for an aggregate principal amount of $29.0 billion (collectively
the notes). the company has entered, and may enter in the future, into interest rate swaps to manage interest rate risk on the notes. interest rate swaps allow the company to effectively convert fixed-rate payments into floating-rate
payments or floating-rate payments into fixed-rate payments. in the third quarter of 2014, the company entered into interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional amount of $9.0 billion, which effectively converted most of the fixed-rate notes into
floating-rate notes, and in the third quarter of 2013, the company entered into interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional amount of $3.0 billion, which effectively converted the floating-rate notes into fixed-rate notes.capital return programin april 2014, the companys board
of directors increased the share repurchase program authorization from $60 billion to $90 billion of the companys common stock, of which $67.9 billion had been utilized as of september 27, 2014. the share repurchase program is expected to
be completed by the end of december 2015. the companys share repurchase program does not obligate it to acquire any specific number of shares. under the program, shares may be repurchased in privately negotiated or open market transactions,
including under plans complying with rule 10b5-1 under the exchange act.apple inc. | 2014 form 10-k | 36

the increase to the companys share repurchase program authorization resulted in a total capital return
program of over $130 billion. the company expects to complete the capital return program by the end of december 2015 by paying dividends and dividend equivalents, repurchasing shares and remitting withheld taxes related to net share settlement of
restricted stock units. to assist in funding its capital return program, the company expects to access the debt markets, both domestically and internationally.the following table presents the companys dividends, dividend equivalents, share repurchases and net share settlement activity from the start of

purchase commitmentsthe company utilizes several outsourcing partners to manufacture sub-assemblies for the companys products and to perform final assembly and testing
of finished products. these outsourcing partners acquire components and build product based on demand information supplied by the company, which typically covers periods up to 150 days. the company also obtains individual components for its products
from a wide variety of individual suppliers. consistent with industry practice, the company acquires components through a combination of purchase orders, supplier contracts and open orders based on projected demand information. where
appropriate, the purchases are applied to inventory component prepayments that are outstanding with the respective supplier.other
obligationsthe companys other obligations were comprised mainly of commitments to acquire capital assets, including product tooling and
manufacturing process equipment and commitments related to advertising, r&d, internet and telecommunications services and other obligations.the
companys other non-current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets consist primarily of deferred tax liabilities, gross unrecognized tax benefits and the related gross interest and penalties. as of september 27, 2014, the company
had non-current deferred tax liabilities of $20.3 billion. additionally, as of september 27, 2014, the company had gross unrecognized tax benefits of $4.0 billion and an additional $630 million for gross interest and penalties classified as
non-current liabilities. at this time, the company is unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments in individual years in connection with these tax liabilities; therefore, such amounts are not included in the above
contractual obligation table.indemnificationthe company
generally does not indemnify end-users of its operating system and application software against legal claims that the software infringes third-party intellectual property rights. other agreements entered into by the company sometimes include
indemnification provisions under which the company could be subject to costs and/or damages in the event of an infringement claim against the company or an indemnified third-party. however, the company has not been required to make any significant
payments resulting from such an infringement claim asserted against it or an indemnified third-party. in the opinion of management, there was not at least a reasonable possibility the company may have incurred a material loss with respect to
indemnification of end-users of its operating system or application software for infringement of third-party intellectual property rights. the company did not record a liability for infringement costs related to indemnification as of
september 27, 2014 or september 28, 2013.the company has entered into indemnification agreements with its directors and executive
officers. under these agreements, the company has agreed to indemnify such individuals to the fullest extent permitted by law against liabilities that arise by reason of their status as directors or officers and to advance expenses incurred by such
individuals in connection with related legal proceedings. it is not possible to determine the maximum potential amount of payments the company could be required to make under these agreements due to the limited history of prior indemnification
claims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each claim. however, the company maintains directors and officers liability insurance coverage to reduce its exposure to such obligations and payments made under these agreements historically
have not been material.apple inc. | 2014 form 10-k | 38



critical accounting policies and estimatesthe preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles (gaap) and
the companys discussion and analysis of its financial condition and operating results require the companys management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported in its consolidated financial statements
and accompanying notes. note 1, summary of significant accounting policies of the notes to consolidated financial statements in part ii, item 8 of this form 10-k describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in
the preparation of the companys consolidated financial statements. management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the
basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. actual results may differ from these estimates and such differences may be material.management believes the companys critical accounting policies and estimates are those related to revenue recognition, valuation and impairment of
marketable securities, inventory valuation and valuation of manufacturing-related assets and estimated purchase commitment cancellation fees, warranty costs, income taxes and legal and other contingencies. management considers these policies
critical because they are both important to the portrayal of the companys financial condition and operating results, and they require management to make judgments and estimates about inherently uncertain matters. the companys senior
management has reviewed these critical accounting policies and related disclosures with the audit and finance committee of the companys board of directors.revenue recognitionnet sales consist primarily of revenue
from the sale of hardware, software, digital content and applications, accessories, and service and support contracts. the company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the sales price is fixed
or determinable and collection is probable. product is considered delivered to the customer once it has been shipped and title, risk of loss and rewards of ownership have been transferred. for most of the companys product sales, these criteria
are met at the time the product is shipped. for online sales to individuals, for some sales to education customers in the u.s., and for certain other sales, the company defers revenue until the customer receives the product because the company
retains a portion of the risk of loss on these sales during transit. the company recognizes revenue from the sale of hardware products, software bundled with hardware that is essential to the functionality of the hardware and third-party digital
content sold on the itunes store in accordance with general revenue recognition accounting guidance. the company recognizes revenue in accordance with industry specific software accounting guidance for the following types of sales transactions:
(i) standalone sales of software products, (ii) sales of software upgrades and (iii) sales of software bundled with hardware not essential to the functionality of the hardware.for multi-element arrangements that include hardware products containing software essential to the hardware products functionality, undelivered
software elements that relate to the hardware products essential software and/or undelivered non-software services, the company allocates revenue to all deliverables based on their relative selling prices. in such circumstances, the company
uses a hierarchy to determine the selling price to be used for allocating revenue to deliverables: (i) vendor-specific objective evidence of fair value (vsoe), (ii) third-party evidence of selling price (tpe) and
(iii) best estimate of selling price (esp). vsoe generally exists only when the company sells the deliverable separately and is the price actually charged by the company for that deliverable. esps reflect the companys best
estimates of what the selling prices of elements would be if they were sold regularly on a stand-alone basis.for sales of qualifying versions of
ios devices, mac and apple tv, the company has indicated it may from time to time provide future unspecified software upgrades and features free of charge to customers. the company also provides various non-software services to owners of qualifying
versions of ios devices and mac. because the company has neither vsoe nor tpe for the unspecified software upgrade rights or the non-software services, revenue is allocated to these rights and services based on the companys esps. revenue
allocated to the unspecified software upgrade rights and non-software services based on the companys esps is deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis over the estimated period the software upgrades and non-software services are
expected to be provided for each of these devices, which ranges from two to four years.apple inc. | 2014 form 10-k | 39



the companys process for determining esps involves managements judgment and considers multiple
factors that may vary over time depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each deliverable. should future facts and circumstances change, the companys esps and the future rate of related amortization for software upgrades
and non-software services related to future sales of these devices could change. factors subject to change include the unspecified software upgrade rights offered, the estimated value of unspecified software upgrade rights, the estimated or actual
costs incurred to provide non-software services and the estimated period software upgrades and non-software services are expected to be provided.the company records reductions to revenue for estimated commitments related to price protection and other customer incentive programs. for transactions
involving price protection, the company recognizes revenue net of the estimated amount to be refunded, provided the refund amount can be reasonably and reliably estimated and the other conditions for revenue recognition have been met. the
companys policy requires that, if refunds cannot be reliably estimated, revenue is not recognized until reliable estimates can be made or the price protection lapses. for the companys other customer incentive programs, the estimated cost
is recognized at the later of the date at which the company has sold the product or the date at which the program is offered. the company also records reductions to revenue for expected future product returns based on the companys historical
experience. future market conditions and product transitions may require the company to increase customer incentive programs that could result in reductions to future revenue. additionally, certain customer incentive programs require management to
estimate the number of customers who will actually redeem the incentive. managements estimates are based on historical experience and the specific terms and conditions of particular incentive programs. if a greater than estimated proportion of
customers redeems such incentives, the company would be required to record additional reductions to revenue, which would have an adverse impact on the companys results of operations.valuation and impairment of marketable securitiesthe
companys investments in available-for-sale securities are reported at fair value. unrealized gains and losses related to changes in the fair value of securities are recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income, net of tax, in the
companys consolidated balance sheets. changes in the fair value of available-for-sale securities impact the companys net income only when such securities are sold or an other-than-temporary impairment is recognized. realized gains and
losses on the sale of securities are determined by specific identification of each securitys cost basis. the company regularly reviews its investment portfolio to determine if any security is other-than-temporarily impaired, which would
require the company to record an impairment charge in the period any such determination is made. in making this judgment, the company evaluates, among other things, the duration and extent to which the fair value of a security is less than its cost;
the financial condition of the issuer and any changes thereto; and the companys intent to sell, or whether it will more likely than not be required to sell, the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis. the companys
assessment on whether a security is other-than-temporarily impaired could change in the future due to new developments or changes in assumptions related to any particular security.inventory valuation and valuation of manufacturing-related assets and estimated purchase commitment cancellation feesthe company must order components for its products and build inventory in advance of product shipments and has invested in manufacturing process
equipment, including capital assets held at its suppliers facilities. in addition, the company has made prepayments to certain of its suppliers associated with long-term supply agreements to secure supply of inventory components. the company
records a write-down for inventories of components and products, including third-party products held for resale, which have become obsolete or are in excess of anticipated demand or net realizable value. the company performs a detailed review of
inventory that considers multiple factors including demand forecasts, product life cycle status, product development plans, current sales levels and component cost trends. the company also reviews its manufacturing-related capital assets and
inventory prepayments for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. if the company determines that an asset is not recoverable, it records an impairment loss equal to the amount
by which the carrying value of such an asset exceeds its fair value.apple inc. | 2014 form 10-k | 40



the industries in which the company competes are subject to a rapid and unpredictable pace of product and
component obsolescence and demand changes. in certain circumstances the company may be required to record additional write-downs of inventory, inventory prepayments and/or manufacturing-related capital assets. these circumstances include future
demand or market conditions for the companys products being less favorable than forecasted, unforeseen technological changes or changes to the companys product development plans that negatively impact the utility of any of these assets,
or significant deterioration in the financial condition of one or more of the companys suppliers that hold any of the companys manufacturing process equipment or to whom the company has made an inventory prepayment. such write-downs
would adversely affect the companys results of operations in the period when the write-downs were recorded.the company records accruals for
estimated cancellation fees related to component orders that have been cancelled or are expected to be cancelled. consistent with industry practice, the company acquires components through a combination of purchase orders, supplier contracts and
open orders in each case based on projected demand. where appropriate, the purchases are applied to inventory component prepayments that are outstanding with the respective supplier. purchase commitments typically cover the companys
forecasted component and manufacturing requirements for periods up to 150 days. if there is an abrupt and substantial decline in demand for one or more of the companys products, if the companys product development plans change, or if
there is an unanticipated change in technological requirements for any of the companys products, then the company may be required to record additional accruals for cancellation fees that would adversely affect its results of operations in the
period when the cancellation fees are identified and recorded.warranty coststhe company provides for the estimated cost of warranties at the time the related revenue is recognized based on historical and projected warranty claim
rates, historical and projected cost-per-claim and knowledge of specific product failures that are outside of the companys typical experience. each quarter, the company re-evaluates these estimates to assess the adequacy of its recorded
warranty liabilities considering the size of the installed base of products subject to warranty protection and adjusts the amounts as necessary. if actual product failure rates or repair costs differ from estimates, revisions to the estimated
warranty liabilities would be required and could materially affect the companys results of operations.income taxesthe company records a tax provision for the anticipated tax consequences of the reported results of operations. the provision for income taxes is computed
using the asset and liability method, under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, and for
operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in effect for the years in which those tax assets are expected to be realized or
settled. the company records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is believed more likely than not to be realized.the company recognizes tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on
examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood
of being realized upon ultimate settlement.management believes it is more likely than not that forecasted income, including income that may be
generated as a result of certain tax planning strategies, together with future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, will be sufficient to fully recover the deferred tax assets. in the event that the company determines all or part of
the net deferred tax assets are not realizable in the future, the company will make an adjustment to the valuation allowance that would be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made. in addition, the calculation of tax liabilities
involves significant judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of gaap and complex tax laws. resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with managements expectations could have a material impact on
the companys financial condition and operating results.apple inc. | 2014 form 10-k | 41


## Item 7A


debtin april
2014, the board of directors authorized the company to issue commercial paper pursuant to a commercial paper program. as of september 27, 2014, the company had $6.3 billion of commercial paper outstanding, with maturities generally less than
nine months.in the third quarters of 2014 and 2013, the company issued $12.0 billion and $17.0 billion of long-term debt, respectively. the debt
issuances included floating- and fixed-rate notes with varying maturities for an aggregate principal amount of $29.0 billion (collectively the notes). the company has entered, and may enter in the future, into interest rate swaps to
manage interest rate risk on the notes. interest rate swaps allow the company to effectively convert fixed-rate payments into floating-rate payments or floating-rate payments into fixed-rate payments. in the third quarter of 2014, the company
entered into interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional amount of $9.0 billion, which effectively converted most of the fixed-rate notes into floating-rate notes, and in the third quarter of 2013, the company entered into interest rate swaps
with an aggregate notional amount of $3.0 billion, which effectively converted the floating-rate notes into fixed-rate notes. as of september 27, 2014, a 100 basis point increase in market interest rates would cause interest expense on the
companys debt to increase by $110 million on an annualized basis.further details regarding the companys debt is provided in part ii,
item 8 of this form 10-k in the notes to consolidated financial statements in note 6, debt.foreign
currency riskin general, the company is a net receiver of currencies other than the u.s. dollar. accordingly, changes in exchange rates, and in
particular a strengthening of the u.s. dollar, will negatively affect the companys net sales and gross margins as expressed in u.s. dollars. there is a risk that the company will have to adjust local currency product pricing due to competitive
pressures when there have been significant volatility in foreign currency exchange rates.the company may enter into foreign currency forward and
option contracts with financial institutions to protect against foreign exchange risks associated with certain existing assets and liabilities, certain firmly committed transactions, forecasted future cash flows and net investments in foreign
subsidiaries. the companys practice is to hedge a portion of its material foreign exchange exposures, typically for up to 12 months. however, the company may choose not to hedge certain foreign exchange exposures for a variety of reasons,
including but not limited to accounting considerations and the prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures.to provide a meaningful
assessment of the foreign currency risk associated with certain of the companys foreign currency derivative positions, the company performed a sensitivity analysis using a value-at-risk (var) model to assess the potential impact of
fluctuations in exchange rates. the var model consisted of using a monte carlo simulation to generate thousands of random market price paths assuming normal market conditions. the var is the maximum expected loss in fair value, for a given
confidence interval, to the companys foreign currency derivative positions due to adverse movements in rates. the var model is not intended to represent actual losses but is used as a risk estimation and management tool. the model assumes
normal market conditions. forecasted transactions, firm commitments and assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies were excluded from the model. based on the results of the model, the company estimates with 95% confidence a maximum
one-day loss in fair value of $240 million as of september 27, 2014 compared to a maximum one-day loss in fair value of $201 million as of september 28, 2013. because the company uses foreign currency instruments for hedging purposes, the
loss in fair value incurred on those instruments are generally offset by increases in the fair value of the underlying exposures.actual future
gains and losses associated with the companys investment portfolio and derivative positions may differ materially from the sensitivity analyses performed as of september 27, 2014 due to the inherent limitations associated with predicting
the timing and amount of changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchanges rates and the companys actual exposures and positions.apple inc. | 2014 form 10-k | 43

notes to consolidated financial statementsnote 1  summary of significant accounting policiesapple inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries (collectively apple or the company) designs, manufactures and
markets mobile communication and media devices, personal computers and portable digital music players, and sells a variety of related software, services, accessories, networking solutions and third-party digital content and applications. the company
sells its products worldwide through its retail stores, online stores and direct sales force, as well as through third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers and value-added resellers. in addition, the company sells a variety of
third-party iphone, ipad, mac and ipod compatible products, including application software, and various accessories through its online and retail stores. the company sells to consumers, small and mid-sized businesses, and education, enterprise and
government customers.basis of presentation and preparationthe accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the company. intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. the
preparation of these consolidated financial statements in conformity with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles (gaap) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in these consolidated
financial statements and accompanying notes. actual results could differ materially from those estimates.the companys fiscal year is the 52
or 53-week period that ends on the last saturday of september. the companys fiscal years 2014, 2013 and 2012 ended on september 27, 2014, september 28, 2013 and september 29, 2012, respectively. an additional week is
included in the first fiscal quarter approximately every six years to realign fiscal quarters with calendar quarters. fiscal years 2014 and 2013 spanned 52 weeks each. fiscal year 2012 spanned 53 weeks, with a 14th week included in the first
quarter of 2012. unless otherwise stated, references to particular years, quarters, months and periods refer to the companys fiscal years ended in september and the associated quarters, months and periods of those fiscal years.during the first quarter of 2014, the company adopted updated accounting standards that (i) required disclosure of additional information about the
amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income (aoci) by component and (ii) required gross and net disclosures about offsetting assets and liabilities. the adoption of these updated standards only impacted the
disclosures in the notes to consolidated financial statements; accordingly, the adoption had no impact on the companys financial position or results of operations. the company has provided these additional disclosures in this form 10-k in note 8, comprehensive income and note 2, financial instruments, respectively.common
stock spliton june 6, 2014, the company effected a seven-for-one stock split to shareholders of record as of june 2, 2014. all share
and per share information has been retroactively adjusted to reflect the stock split.revenue recognitionnet sales consist primarily of revenue from the sale of hardware, software, digital content and applications, accessories and service and support
contracts. the company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the sales price is fixed or determinable and collection is probable. product is considered delivered to the customer once it has been
shipped and title, risk of loss and rewards of ownership have been transferred. for most of the companys product sales, these criteria are met at the time the product is shipped. for online sales to individuals, for some sales to education
customers in the u.s., and for certain other sales, the company defers revenue until the customer receives the product because the company retains a portion of the risk of loss on these sales during transit. the company recognizes revenue from the
sale of hardware products, software bundled with hardware that is essential to the functionality of the hardware, and third-party digital content sold on the itunes store in accordance with general revenue recognition accounting guidance. the
company recognizes revenue in accordance with industry specific software accounting guidance for the following types of sales transactions: (i) standalone sales of software products, (ii) sales of software upgrades and (iii) sales of
software bundled with hardware not essential to the functionality of the hardware.apple inc. | 2014 form 10-k | 50



for the sale of most third-party products, the company recognizes revenue based on the gross amount billed
to customers because the company establishes its own pricing for such products, retains related inventory risk for physical products, is the primary obligor to the customer and assumes the credit risk for amounts billed to its customers. for
third-party applications sold through the app store and mac app store and certain digital content sold through the itunes store, the company does not determine the selling price of the products and is not the primary obligor to the customer.
therefore, the company accounts for such sales on a net basis by recognizing in net sales only the commission it retains from each sale. the portion of the gross amount billed to customers that is remitted by the company to third-party app
developers and certain digital content owners is not reflected in the companys consolidated statements of operations.the company records
deferred revenue when it receives payments in advance of the delivery of products or the performance of services. this includes amounts that have been deferred for unspecified and specified software upgrade rights and non-software services that are
attached to hardware and software products. the company sells gift cards redeemable at its retail and online stores, and also sells gift cards redeemable on the itunes store for the purchase of digital content and software. the company records
deferred revenue upon the sale of the card, which is relieved upon redemption of the card by the customer. revenue from applecare service and support contracts is deferred and recognized over the service coverage periods. applecare service and
support contracts typically include extended phone support, repair services, web-based support resources and diagnostic tools offered under the companys standard limited warranty.the company records reductions to revenue for estimated commitments related to price protection and other customer incentive programs. for transactions
involving price protection, the company recognizes revenue net of the estimated amount to be refunded. for the companys other customer incentive programs, the estimated cost of these programs is recognized at the later of the date at which the
company has sold the product or the date at which the program is offered. the company also records reductions to revenue for expected future product returns based on the companys historical experience. revenue is recorded net of taxes
collected from customers that are remitted to governmental authorities, with the collected taxes recorded as current liabilities until remitted to the relevant government authority.revenue recognition for arrangements with multiple deliverablesfor multi-element arrangements that include hardware products containing software essential to the hardware products functionality, undelivered
software elements that relate to the hardware products essential software, and undelivered non-software services, the company allocates revenue to all deliverables based on their relative selling prices. in such circumstances, the company uses
a hierarchy to determine the selling price to be used for allocating revenue to deliverables: (i) vendor-specific objective evidence of fair value (vsoe), (ii) third-party evidence of selling price (tpe) and
(iii) best estimate of selling price (esp). vsoe generally exists only when the company sells the deliverable separately and is the price actually charged by the company for that deliverable. esps reflect the companys best
estimates of what the selling prices of elements would be if they were sold regularly on a stand-alone basis. for multi-element arrangements accounted for in accordance with industry specific software accounting guidance, the company allocates
revenue to all deliverables based on the vsoe of each element, and if vsoe does not exist revenue is recognized when elements lacking vsoe are delivered.for sales of qualifying versions of iphone, ipad and ipod touch (ios devices), mac and apple tv, the company has indicated it may from time
to time provide future unspecified software upgrades and features to the essential software bundled with each of these hardware products free of charge to customers. essential software for ios devices includes ios and related applications and for
mac includes os x and related applications. the company also provides various non-software services to owners of qualifying versions of ios devices and mac. the company has identified up to three deliverables regularly included in arrangements
involving the sale of these devices. the first deliverable is the hardware and software essential to the functionality of the hardware device delivered at the time of sale. the second deliverable is the embedded right included with the purchase of
ios devices, mac and apple tv to receive on a when-and-if-available basis, future unspecified software upgrades and features relating to the products essential software. the third deliverable is the non-software services to be provided to
qualifying versions of ios devices and mac. the company allocates revenue between these deliverables using the relative selling price method. because the company has neither vsoe nor tpe for these deliverables, the allocation of revenue is based on
the companys esps. revenue allocated to the delivered hardware and the related essential software is recognized at the time of sale provided the other conditions for revenue recognition have been met. revenue allocated to the embedded

software upgrade rights and the non-software services is deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis over the estimated period the software upgrades and non-software services are expected to
be provided for each of these devices, which ranges from two to four years. cost of sales related to delivered hardware and related essential software, including estimated warranty costs, are recognized at the time of sale. costs incurred to provide
non-software services are recognized as cost of sales as incurred, and engineering and sales and marketing costs are recognized as operating expenses as incurred.the companys process for determining its esp for deliverables without vsoe or tpe considers multiple factors that may vary depending upon the
unique facts and circumstances related to each deliverable. the company believes its customers would be reluctant to buy unspecified software upgrade rights for the essential software included with its qualifying hardware products. this view is
primarily based on the fact that unspecified software upgrade rights do not obligate the company to provide upgrades at a particular time or at all, and do not specify to customers which upgrades or features will be delivered. the company also
believes its customers would be unwilling to pay a significant amount for access to the non-software services because other companies offer similar services at little or no cost to users. therefore, the company has concluded that if it were to sell
upgrade rights or access to the non-software services on a standalone basis, including those rights and services attached to ios devices, mac and apple tv, the selling prices would be relatively low. key factors considered by the company in
developing the esps for software upgrade rights include prices charged by the company for similar offerings, market trends in the pricing of apple-branded and third-party mac and ios compatible software, the nature of the upgrade rights (e.g.,
unspecified versus specified) and the relative esp of the upgrade rights as compared to the total selling price of the product. the company may also consider additional factors as appropriate, including the impact of other products and services
provided to customers, the pricing of competitive alternatives if they exist, product-specific business objectives and the length of time a particular version of a device has been available. when relevant, the same factors are considered by the
company in developing esps for offerings such as the non-software services with additional consideration given to the estimated cost to provide such services.in 2014, 2013 and 2012, the companys combined esps for the unspecified software upgrade rights and the rights to receive the non-software services
included with its qualifying hardware devices have ranged from $5 to $40. as of september 27, 2014, the combined esps for mac was $40 and for iphone and ipad ranged from $15 to $25. revenue allocated to such rights is deferred and recognized on
a straight-line basis over the estimated period the rights are expected to be provided for each device, which ranges from two to four years.shipping costsfor all periods presented, amounts billed to customers related to shipping and handling are classified as revenue, and the companys
shipping and handling costs are included in cost of sales.warranty coststhe company generally provides for the estimated cost of hardware and software warranties at the time the related revenue is recognized. the company
assesses the adequacy of its pre-existing warranty liabilities and adjusts the amounts as necessary based on actual experience and changes in future estimates.software development costsresearch and development
(r&d) costs are expensed as incurred. development costs of computer software to be sold, leased, or otherwise marketed are subject to capitalization beginning when a products technological feasibility has been established and
ending when a product is available for general release to customers. in most instances, the companys products are released soon after technological feasibility has been established. costs incurred subsequent to achievement of technological
feasibility were not significant, and software development costs were expensed as incurred during 2014, 2013 and 2012.advertising costsadvertising costs are expensed as incurred and included in selling, general and administrative expenses. advertising expense was $1.2 billion, $1.1

share-based compensationthe company recognizes expense related to share-based payment transactions in which it receives employee services in exchange for (a) equity
instruments of the company or (b) liabilities that are based on the fair value of the enterprises equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of such equity instruments. share-based compensation cost for restricted stock and
restricted stock units (rsus) is measured based on the closing fair market value of the companys common stock on the date of grant. the company recognizes share-based compensation cost over the awards requisite service period
on a straight-line basis for time-based rsus and on a graded basis for rsus that are contingent on the achievement of performance metrics. the company recognizes a benefit from share-based compensation in the consolidated statements of
shareholders equity if an incremental tax benefit is realized. in addition, the company recognizes the indirect effects of share-based compensation on r&d tax credits, foreign tax credits and domestic manufacturing deductions in the
consolidated statements of operations. further information regarding share-based compensation can be found in note 9, benefit plans of this form 10-k.income taxesthe provision for income taxes is computed using
the asset and liability method, under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and for
operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in effect for the years in which those tax assets are expected to be realized or
settled. the company records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is believed more likely than not to be realized.the company recognizes the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not the tax position will be sustained on
examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood
of being realized upon settlement. see note 5, income taxes of this form 10-k for additional information.earnings per sharebasic earnings per share is computed by dividing income available to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock
outstanding during the period. diluted earnings per share is computed by dividing income available to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period increased to include the number of
additional shares of common stock that would have been outstanding if the potentially dilutive securities had been issued. potentially dilutive securities include outstanding stock options, shares to be purchased under the companys employee
stock purchase plan, unvested restricted stock and unvested rsus. the dilutive effect of potentially dilutive securities is reflected in diluted earnings per share by application of the treasury stock method. under the treasury stock method, an
increase in the fair market value of the companys common stock can result in a greater dilutive effect from potentially dilutive securities.the following table shows the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share for 2014, 2013 and 2012 (net income in millions and shares in

financial instrumentscash
equivalents and marketable securitiesall highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase are
classified as cash equivalents. the companys marketable debt and equity securities have been classified and accounted for as available-for-sale. management
determines the appropriate classification of its investments at the time of purchase and reevaluates the designations at each balance sheet date. the company classifies its marketable debt securities as either short-term or long-term based on each
instruments underlying contractual maturity date. marketable debt securities with maturities of 12 months or less are classified as short-term and marketable debt securities with maturities greater than 12 months are classified as long-term.
the company classifies its marketable equity securities, including mutual funds, as either short-term or long-term based on the nature of each security and its availability for use in current operations. the companys marketable debt and equity
securities are carried at fair value, with the unrealized gains and losses, net of taxes, reported as a component of shareholders equity. the cost of securities sold is based upon the specific identification method.derivative financial instrumentsthe company accounts for its
derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities and carries them at fair value.for derivative instruments that hedge the exposure to
variability in expected future cash flows that are designated as cash flow hedges, the effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative instrument is reported as a component of aoci in shareholders equity and reclassified into income in
the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. the ineffective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative instrument, if any, is recognized in current income. to receive hedge accounting treatment, cash flow
hedges must be highly effective in offsetting changes to expected future cash flows on hedged transactions. for options designated as cash flow hedges, changes in the time value are excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and are
recognized in income. for derivative instruments that hedge the exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset or a liability and that are designated as fair value hedges, both the net gain or loss on the derivative instrument as well as the
offsetting gain or loss on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are recognized in earnings in the current period. for derivative instruments designated as a hedge of the foreign currency translation exposure of the net investment in a
foreign operation, the net gain or loss on the effective portion of the derivative instrument is reported in the same manner as a foreign currency translation adjustment. for forward exchange contracts designated as net investment hedges, the
company excludes changes in fair value relating to changes in the forward carry component from its definition of effectiveness. accordingly, any gains or losses related to this component are recognized in current income. derivatives that do not
qualify as hedges are adjusted to fair value through current income.allowance for doubtful accountsthe company records its allowance for doubtful accounts based upon its assessment of various factors. the company considers historical experience, the age
of the accounts receivable balances, credit quality of the companys customers, current economic conditions and other factors that may affect customers ability to pay.inventoriesinventories are stated at the lower of cost,
computed using the first-in, first-out method, or market. if the cost of the inventories exceeds their market value, provisions are made currently for the difference between the cost and the market value.property, plant and equipmentproperty, plant and equipment
are stated at cost. depreciation is computed by use of the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which for buildings is the lesser of 30 years or the remaining life of the
underlying building; between two to five years for machinery and equipment, including product tooling and manufacturing process equipment; and the shorter of lease terms or ten years for leasehold improvements. the company capitalizes eligible costs
to acquire or develop internal-use software that are incurred subsequent to the preliminary project stage. capitalized costs related to internal-use software are amortized using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets,
which range from three to five years. depreciation and amortization expense on property and equipment was $6.9 billion, $5.8 billion and $2.6 billion during 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.apple inc. | 2014 form 10-k | 54



long-lived assets including goodwill and other acquired intangible assetsthe company reviews property, plant and equipment, inventory component prepayments and certain identifiable intangibles, excluding goodwill, for
impairment. long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. recoverability of these assets is measured by comparison of their carrying amounts
to future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate. if property, plant and equipment, inventory component prepayments and certain identifiable intangibles are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized equals the
amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds its fair value. the company did not record any significant impairments during 2014, 2013 and 2012.the company does not amortize goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives, rather such assets are required to be tested for impairment at
least annually or sooner whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the assets may be impaired. the company performs its goodwill and intangible asset impairment tests in the fourth quarter of each year. the company did not recognize
any impairment charges related to goodwill or indefinite lived intangible assets during 2014, 2013 and 2012. the company established reporting units based on its current reporting structure. for purposes of testing goodwill for impairment, goodwill
has been allocated to these reporting units to the extent it relates to each reporting unit. in 2014 and 2013, the companys goodwill was allocated to the americas and europe reportable operating segments.the company amortizes its intangible assets with definite useful lives over their estimated useful lives and reviews these assets for impairment. the
company typically amortizes its acquired intangible assets with definite useful lives over periods from three to seven years.fair value measurementsthe company applies fair value accounting for all financial assets and liabilities and non-financial assets and liabilities that are recognized or
disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis. the company defines fair value as the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants
at the measurement date. when determining the fair value measurements for assets and liabilities, which are required to be recorded at fair value, the company considers the principal or most advantageous market in which the company would transact
and the market-based risk measurements or assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, such as risks inherent in valuation techniques, transfer restrictions and credit risk. fair value is estimated by applying
the following hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value into three levels and bases the categorization within the hierarchy upon the lowest level of input that is available and significant to the fair value measurement:level 1  quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.level 2  observable inputs other than quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities, quoted prices for identical or
similar assets or liabilities in inactive markets, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.level 3  inputs that are generally unobservable and typically reflect managements estimate of assumptions that market participants
would use in pricing the asset or liability.the companys valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of money market funds and
certain marketable equity securities were derived from quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. the valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of the companys debt instruments and all other financial
instruments, all of which have counterparties with high credit ratings, were valued based on quoted market prices or model driven valuations using significant inputs derived from or corroborated by observable market data.in accordance with the fair value accounting requirements, companies may choose to measure eligible financial instruments and certain other items at fair
value. the company has not elected the fair value option for any eligible financial instruments.apple inc. | 2014 form 10-k | 55

foreign currency translation and remeasurementthe company translates the assets and liabilities of its non-u.s. dollar functional currency subsidiaries into u.s. dollars using exchange rates in effect
at the end of each period. revenue and expenses for these subsidiaries are translated using rates that approximate those in effect during the period. gains and losses from these translations are recognized in foreign currency translation included in
aoci in shareholders equity. the companys subsidiaries that use the u.s. dollar as their functional currency remeasure monetary assets and liabilities at exchange rates in effect at the end of each period, and inventories, property and
nonmonetary assets and liabilities at historical rates. gains and losses from these remeasurements were not significant during 2014, 2013 and 2012 and have been included in the companys results of operations.note 2  financial instrumentscash, cash equivalents and marketable securitiesthe following tables show the companys cash and available-for-sale

gross unrealized losses related to individual securities that had been in a continuous loss position for 12 months or longer were not significant.as of september 27, 2014, the company considers the declines in market value of its marketable securities investment portfolio to be temporary in
nature and does not consider any of its investments other-than-temporarily impaired. the company typically invests in highly-rated securities, and its investment policy limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. the policy generally
requires investments to be investment grade, with the primary objective of minimizing the potential risk of principal loss. fair values were determined for each individual security in the investment portfolio. when evaluating an investment for
other-than-temporary impairment, the company reviews factors such as the length of time and extent to which fair value has been below its cost basis, the financial condition of the issuer and any changes thereto, changes in market interest rates,
and the companys intent to sell, or whether it is more likely than not it will be required to sell, the investment before recovery of the investments cost basis. during 2014, 2013 and 2012 the company did not recognize any significant

derivative financial instrumentsthe company uses derivatives to partially offset its business exposure to foreign currency and interest rate risk. the company may enter into forward
contracts, option contracts, swaps, or other derivative instruments to offset some of the risk on expected future cash flows, on net investments in certain foreign subsidiaries and on certain existing assets and liabilities. however, the company may
choose not to hedge certain exposures for a variety of reasons including, but not limited to, accounting considerations and the prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures. there can be no assurance the hedges will offset more than a
portion of the financial impact resulting from movements in foreign currency exchange or interest rates.to help protect gross margins from
fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, certain of the companys subsidiaries whose functional currency is the u.s. dollar hedge a portion of forecasted foreign currency revenue. the companys subsidiaries whose functional
currency is not the u.s. dollar and who sell in local currencies may hedge a portion of forecasted inventory purchases not denominated in the subsidiaries functional currencies. the company typically hedges portions of its forecasted foreign
currency exposure associated with revenue and inventory purchases, typically for up to 12 months.to help protect the net investment in a foreign
operation from adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates, the company may enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts to offset the changes in the carrying amounts of these investments due to fluctuations in foreign currency
exchange rates.the company may also enter into foreign currency forward contracts and option contracts to partially offset the foreign currency
exchange gains and losses generated by the re-measurement of certain assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies.the company
may enter into interest rate swaps, options, or other instruments to manage interest rate risk. these instruments may offset a portion of changes in income or expense, or changes in fair value of the companys long-term debt or investments.the company records all derivatives in the consolidated balance sheets at fair value. the companys accounting treatment for these instruments
is based on the hedge designation. the effective portions of cash flow hedges are recorded in aoci until the hedged item is recognized in earnings. gains and losses related to changes in fair value hedges are recognized in earnings along with a
corresponding loss or gain related to the change in value of the underlying hedged item. the effective portions of net investment hedges are recorded in other comprehensive income (oci) as a part of the cumulative translation adjustment.
the ineffective portions of cash flow hedges and net investment hedges are recorded in other income and expense. derivatives that are not designated as hedging instruments are adjusted to fair value through earnings in the financial statement line
item to which the derivative relates.deferred gains and losses associated with cash flow hedges of foreign currency revenue are recognized as a
component of net sales in the same period as the related revenue is recognized, and deferred gains and losses related to cash flow hedges of inventory purchases are recognized as a component of cost of sales in the same period as the related costs
are recognized. deferred gains and losses associated with cash flow hedges of interest income or expense are recognized as a component of other income/(expense), net in the same period as the related income or expense is recognized. the
companys foreign currency and interest rate transactions hedged with cash flow hedges as of september 27, 2014 are expected to occur within 12 months and four years, respectively.derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges must be de-designated as hedges when it is probable the forecasted hedged transaction will not
occur in the initially identified time period or within a subsequent two-month time period. deferred gains and losses in aoci associated with such derivative instruments are reclassified immediately into other income and expense. any subsequent
changes in fair value of such derivative instruments are reflected in other income and expense unless they are re-designated as hedges of other transactions. the company did not recognize any significant net gains or losses related to the loss of
hedge designation on discontinued cash flow hedges during 2014, 2013 and 2012.the gain/loss recognized in other income and expense for foreign
currency forward and option contracts not designated as hedging instruments was not significant during 2014, 2013 and 2012. these amounts represent the net gain or loss on the derivative contracts and do not include changes in the related exposures,
which generally offset a portion of the gain or loss on the derivative contracts.apple inc. | 2014 form 10-k | 58

do not represent the amount of the companys exposure to credit or market loss. the credit risk amounts represent the companys gross exposure to potential accounting loss on derivative instruments that are outstanding or unsettled if all
counterparties failed to perform according to the terms of the contract, based on then-current currency or interest rates at each respective date. the companys gross exposure on these transactions may be
further mitigated by collateral received from certain counterparties. the companys exposure to credit loss and market risk will vary over time as currency and interest rates change. although the table above reflects the notional and credit
risk amounts of the companys derivative instruments, it does not reflect the gains or losses associated with the exposures and transactions that the instruments are intended to hedge. the amounts ultimately realized upon settlement of these
financial instruments, together with the gains and losses on the underlying exposures, will depend on actual market conditions during the remaining life of the instruments.the company generally enters into master netting arrangements, which are designed to reduce credit risk by permitting net settlement of transactions with
the same counterparty. to further limit credit risk, the company generally enters into collateral security arrangements that provide for collateral to be received or posted when the net fair value of certain financial instruments fluctuates from
contractually established thresholds. the company presents its derivative assets and derivative liabilities at their gross fair values in its consolidated balance sheets. as of september 27, 2014, the company received $2.1 billion of cash
collateral related to the derivative instruments under its collateral security arrangements, which were recorded as accrued expenses in the consolidated balance sheet. as of september 28, 2013, the company posted cash collateral related to
the derivative instruments under its collateral security arrangements of $164 million, which were recorded as other current assets in the consolidated balance sheet. the company did not have any derivative instruments with credit-risk related
contingent features that would require it to post additional collateral as of september 27, 2014 or september 28, 2013.under master
netting arrangements with the respective counterparties to the companys derivative contracts, the company is allowed to net settle transactions with a single net amount payable by one party to the other. as of september 27, 2014 and
september 28, 2013, the potential effects of these rights of set-off associated with the companys derivative contracts, including the effects of collateral, would be a reduction to both derivative assets and derivative liabilities
of $1.6 billion and $333 million, respectively, resulting in net derivative liabilities of $549 million and $57 million, respectively.apple inc. | 2014 form 10-k | 59

receivablesthe company has considerable trade receivables outstanding with its third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers,
value-added resellers, small and mid-sized businesses, and education, enterprise and government customers. the company generally does not require collateral from its customers; however, the company will require collateral in certain instances to
limit credit risk. in addition, when possible, the company attempts to limit credit risk on trade receivables with credit insurance for certain customers or by requiring third-party financing, loans or leases to support credit exposure. these
credit-financing arrangements are directly between the third-party financing company and the end customer. as such, the company generally does not assume any recourse or credit risk sharing related to any of these arrangements.as of september 27, 2014, the company had two customers that represented 10% or more of total trade receivables, one of which accounted for 16% and
the other 13%. as of september 28, 2013, the company had two customers that represented 10% or more of total trade receivables, one of which accounted for 13% and the other 10%. the companys cellular network carriers accounted for 72% and

the foreign provision for income taxes is based on foreign pre-tax earnings of $33.6 billion, $30.5 billion
and $36.8 billion in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. the companys consolidated financial statements provide for any related tax liability on undistributed earnings that the company does not intend to be indefinitely reinvested outside
the u.s. substantially all of the companys undistributed international earnings intended to be indefinitely reinvested in operations outside the u.s. were generated by subsidiaries organized in ireland, which has a statutory tax rate of 12.5%.
as of september 27, 2014, u.s. income taxes have not been provided on a cumulative total of $69.7 billion of such earnings. the amount of unrecognized deferred tax liability related to these temporary differences is estimated to be
approximately $23.3 billion.as of september 27, 2014 and september 28, 2013, $137.1 billion and $111.3 billion, respectively, of the

temporary differences between the consolidated financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and are measured using enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in the years in which those
temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.uncertain tax positionstax positions are evaluated in a two-step process. the company first determines whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained
upon examination. if a tax position meets the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold it is then measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements. the tax position is measured as the largest amount of benefit
that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. the company classifies gross interest and penalties and unrecognized tax benefits that are not expected to result in payment or receipt of cash within one year as
non-current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets.as of september 27, 2014, the total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits was
$4.0 billion, of which $1.4 billion, if recognized, would affect the companys effective tax rate. as of september 28, 2013, the total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits was $2.7 billion, of which $1.4 billion, if recognized,
would affect the companys effective tax rate.the aggregate changes in the balance of gross unrecognized tax benefits, which excludes interest

the company includes interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within the provision for
income taxes. as of september 27, 2014 and september 28, 2013, the total amount of gross interest and penalties accrued was $630 million and $590 million, respectively, which is classified as non-current liabilities in the consolidated
balance sheets. in connection with tax matters, the company recognized interest and penalty expense in 2014, 2013 and 2012 of $40 million, $189 million and $140 million, respectively.the company is subject to taxation and files income tax returns in the u.s. federal jurisdiction and in many state and foreign jurisdictions. during the
fiscal year ended september 27, 2014, the u.s. internal revenue service (irs) concluded its review of the years 2004 through 2009, which resulted in the company reducing its gross unrecognized tax benefits by $570 million and
recognizing a tax benefit of $166 million. the irs is currently examining the years 2010 through 2012. in addition, the company is also subject to audits by state, local and foreign tax authorities. in major states and major foreign
jurisdictions, the years subsequent to 1996 and 2002, respectively, generally remain open and could be subject to examination by the taxing authorities.management believes that an adequate provision has been made for any adjustments that may result from tax examinations. however, the outcome of tax
audits cannot be predicted with certainty. if any issues addressed in the companys tax audits are resolved in a manner not consistent with managements expectations, the company could be required to adjust its provision for income taxes
in the period such resolution occurs. although timing of the resolution and/or closure of audits is not certain, the company does not believe it is reasonably possible that its unrecognized tax benefits would materially change in the next 12 months.note 6  debtcommercial paperin april 2014, the board of directors authorized the company to issue unsecured short-term promissory notes (commercial paper) pursuant to a
commercial paper program. the company intends to use net proceeds from the commercial paper program for general corporate purposes, including dividends and share repurchases. as of september 27, 2014, the company had $6.3 billion of commercial

share repurchase programin 2012, the companys board of directors authorized a program to repurchase up to $10 billion of the companys common stock beginning in 2013.
the companys board of directors increased the share repurchase authorization to $60 billion in april 2013 and to $90 billion in april 2014. as of september 27, 2014, $67.9 billion of the $90 billion had been utilized. the companys
share repurchase program does not obligate it to acquire any specific number of shares. under the program, shares may be repurchased in privately negotiated and/or open market transactions, including under plans complying with rule 10b5-1 under the
securities exchange act of 1934, as amended (the exchange act).the company has entered into four accelerated share repurchase
arrangements (asrs) with financial institutions beginning in august 2012. in exchange for up-front payments, the financial institutions deliver shares of the companys common stock during the purchase periods of each asr. the total
number of shares ultimately delivered, and therefore the average repurchase price paid per share, will be determined at the end of the applicable purchase period of each asr based on the volume weighted-average price of the companys common
stock during that period. the shares received are retired in the periods they are delivered, and the up-front payments are accounted for as a reduction to shareholders equity in the companys
consolidated balance sheet in the periods the payments are made. the company reflects the asrs as a repurchase of common stock in the period delivered for purposes of calculating earnings per share and as forward contracts indexed to its own common
stock. the asrs met all of the applicable criteria for equity classification, and therefore, were not accounted for as derivative instruments.the

2014, shareholders approved the 2014 employee stock plan (the 2014 plan) and terminated the companys authority to grant new awards under the 2003 employee stock plan (the 2003 plan). the 2014 plan provides for
broad-based equity grants to employees, including executive officers, and permits the granting of rsus, stock grants, performance-based awards, stock options and stock appreciation rights, as well as cash bonus awards. rsus granted under the 2014
plan generally vest over four years, based on continued employment, and are settled upon vesting in shares of the companys common stock on a one-for-one basis. each share issued with respect to rsus granted under the 2014 plan reduces the
number of shares available for grant under the plan by two shares. rsus cancelled and shares withheld to satisfy tax withholding obligations increase the number of shares available for grant under the 2014 plan utilizing a factor of two times the
number of rsus cancelled or shares withheld. currently, all rsus granted under the 2014 plan have dividend equivalent rights (ders), which entitle holders of rsus to the same dividend value per share as holders of common stock. ders are
subject to the same vesting and other terms and conditions as the corresponding unvested rsus. ders are accumulated and paid when the underlying shares vest. upon approval of the 2014 plan, the company reserved 385 million shares plus the
number of shares remaining that were reserved but not issued under the 2003 plan. shares subject to outstanding awards under the 2003 plan that expire, are cancelled or otherwise terminate, or are withheld to satisfy tax withholding obligations with
respect to rsus, will also be available for awards under the 2014 plan. as of september 27, 2014, approximately 492.6 million shares were reserved for future issuance under the 2014 plan.2003 employee stock planthe 2003 plan is a shareholder
approved plan that provided for broad-based equity grants to employees, including executive officers. the 2003 plan permitted the granting of incentive stock options, nonstatutory stock options, rsus, stock appreciation rights, stock purchase rights
and performance-based awards. options granted under the 2003 plan generally expire seven to ten years after the grant date and generally become exercisable over a period of four years, based on continued employment, with either annual, semi-annual
or quarterly vesting. rsus granted under the 2003 plan generally vest over two to four years, based on continued employment and are settled upon vesting in shares of the companys common stock on a one-for-one basis. all rsus, other than rsus
held by the chief executive officer, granted under the 2003 plan have ders. ders are subject to the same vesting and other terms and conditions as the corresponding unvested rsus. ders are accumulated and paid when the underlying shares vest. in the
second quarter of 2014, the company terminated the authority to grant new awards under the 2003 plan.apple inc. | 2014 form 10-k | 71



1997 director stock planthe 1997 director stock plan (the director plan) is a shareholder approved plan that (i) permits the company to grant awards of rsus or
stock options to the companys non-employee directors, (ii) provides for automatic initial grants of rsus upon a non-employee director joining the board of directors and automatic annual grants of rsus at each annual meeting of
shareholders, and (iii) permits the board of directors to prospectively change the relative mixture of stock options and rsus for the initial and annual award grants and the methodology for determining the number of shares of the companys
common stock subject to these grants without shareholder approval. each share issued with respect to rsus granted under the director plan reduces the number of shares available for grant under the plan by two shares. the director plan expires
november 9, 2019. all rsus granted under the director plan are entitled to ders. ders are subject to the same vesting and other terms and conditions as the corresponding unvested rsus. ders are accumulated and paid when the underlying shares
vest. as of september 27, 2014, approximately 1.2 million shares were reserved for future issuance under the director plan.rule 10b5-1 trading plansduring the fourth quarter of 2014, section 16 officers timothy d. cook, luca maestri, daniel riccio, philip w. schiller, d. bruce sewell and
jeffrey e. williams had equity trading plans in place in accordance with rule 10b5-1(c)(1) under the exchange act. an equity trading plan is a written document that pre-establishes the amounts, prices and
dates (or formula for determining the amounts, prices and dates) of future purchases or sales of the companys stock, including shares acquired pursuant to the companys employee and director equity plans.employee stock purchase planthe employee stock purchase plan
(the purchase plan) is a shareholder approved plan under which substantially all employees may purchase the companys common stock through payroll deductions at a price equal to 85% of the lower of the fair market values of the
stock as of the beginning or the end of six-month offering periods. an employees payroll deductions under the purchase plan are limited to 10% of the employees compensation and employees may not purchase more than $25,000 of stock during
any calendar year. as of september 27, 2014, approximately 7.6 million shares were reserved for future issuance under the purchase plan.401(k) planthe companys 401(k) plan is a deferred salary arrangement under section 401(k) of the internal revenue code. under the 401(k) plan,
participating u.s. employees may defer a portion of their pre-tax earnings, up to the irs annual contribution limit ($17,500 for calendar year 2014). the company matches 50% to 100% of each employees contributions, depending on length of
service, up to a maximum 6% of the employees eligible earnings. the companys matching contributions to the 401(k) plan were $163 million, $135 million and $114 million in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.apple inc. | 2014 form 10-k | 72

and 2012, respectively. the majority of rsus that vested in 2014, 2013 and 2012 were net-share settled such that the company withheld shares with value equivalent to the employees minimum statutory obligation for the applicable income and
other employment taxes, and remitted the cash to the appropriate taxing authorities. the total shares withheld were approximately 15.6 million, 15.5 million and 16.1 million for 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively, and were based on the
value of the rsus on their respective vesting dates as determined by the companys closing stock price. total payments for the employees tax obligations to taxing authorities were $1.2 billion, $1.1 billion and $1.2 billion in 2014,
2013 and 2012, respectively, and are reflected as a financing activity within the consolidated statements of cash flows. these net-share settlements had the effect of share repurchases by the company as they reduced and retired the number of
shares that would have otherwise been issued as a result of the vesting and did not represent an expense to the company.stock optionsthe company had 6.6 million stock options outstanding as of september 27, 2014, with a weighted-average exercise price per share of $21.99 and
weighted-average remaining contractual term of 1.4 years, substantially all of which are exercisable. the aggregate intrinsic value of the stock options outstanding as of september 27, 2014 was $520 million, which represents the value of the
companys closing stock price on the last trading day of the period in excess of the weighted-average exercise price multiplied by the number of options outstanding. total intrinsic value of options at time of exercise was $1.5 billion, $1.0

weighted-average period of 2.9 years.note 10  commitments and contingenciesaccrued warranty and indemnificationthe company offers a basic
limited parts and labor warranty on its hardware products. the basic warranty period for hardware products is typically one year from the date of purchase by the end-user. the company also offers a 90-day
basic warranty for its service parts used to repair the companys hardware products. the company provides currently for the estimated cost that may be incurred under its basic limited product warranties at the time related revenue is
recognized. factors considered in determining appropriate accruals for product warranty obligations include the size of the installed base of products subject to warranty protection, historical and projected warranty claim rates, historical and
projected cost-per-claim and knowledge of specific product failures that are outside of the companys typical experience. the company assesses the adequacy of its pre-existing warranty liabilities and adjusts the amounts as necessary based on
actual experience and changes in future estimates.the following table shows changes in the companys accrued warranties and related costs for

that the software infringes third-party intellectual property rights. other agreements entered into by the company sometimes include indemnification provisions under which the company could be subject to costs and/or damages in the event of an
infringement claim against the company or an indemnified third-party. however, the company has not been required to make any significant payments resulting from such an infringement claim asserted against it or an indemnified third-party. in the
opinion of management, there was not at least a reasonable possibility the company may have incurred a material loss with respect to indemnification of end-users of its operating system or application software for infringement of third-party
intellectual property rights. the company did not record a liability for infringement costs related to indemnification as of september 27, 2014 or september 28, 2013.the company has entered into indemnification agreements with its directors and executive officers. under these agreements, the company has agreed to
indemnify such individuals to the fullest extent permitted by law against liabilities that arise by reason of their status as directors or officers and to advance expenses incurred by such individuals in connection with related legal proceedings. it
is not possible to determine the maximum potential amount of payments the company could be required to make under these agreements due to the limited history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each
claim. however, the company maintains directors and officers liability insurance coverage to reduce its exposure to such obligations, and payments made under these agreements historically have not been material.apple inc. | 2014 form 10-k | 74

concentrations in the available sources of supply of materials and productalthough most components essential to the companys business are generally available from multiple sources, a number of components are currently
obtained from single or limited sources. in addition, the company competes for various components with other participants in the markets for mobile communication and media devices and personal computers. therefore, many components used by the
company, including those that are available from multiple sources, are at times subject to industry-wide shortage and significant pricing fluctuations that could materially adversely affect the companys financial condition and operating
results.the company uses some custom components that are not commonly used by its competitors, and new products introduced by the company often
utilize custom components available from only one source. when a component or product uses new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers yields have matured or manufacturing capacity has increased. if the
companys supply of components for a new or existing product were delayed or constrained, or if an outsourcing partner delayed shipments of completed products to the company, the companys financial condition and operating results could be
materially adversely affected. the companys business and financial performance could also be materially adversely affected depending on the time required to obtain sufficient quantities from the original source, or to identify and obtain
sufficient quantities from an alternative source. continued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at all, may be affected if those suppliers concentrated on the production of common components instead of components customized to
meet the companys requirements.the company has entered into agreements for the supply of many components; however, there can be no guarantee
that the company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms, or at all. therefore, the company remains subject to significant risks of supply shortages and price increases that could materially adversely affect its financial
condition and operating results.substantially all of the companys hardware products are manufactured by outsourcing partners that are located
primarily in asia. a significant concentration of this manufacturing is currently performed by a small number of outsourcing partners, often in single locations. certain of these outsourcing partners are the sole-sourced suppliers of components and
manufacturers for many of the companys products. although the company works closely with its outsourcing partners on manufacturing schedules, the companys operating results could be adversely affected if its outsourcing partners were
unable to meet their production commitments. the companys purchase commitments typically cover its requirements for periods up to 150 days.other
off-balance sheet commitmentsoperating leasesthe
company leases various equipment and facilities, including retail space, under noncancelable operating lease arrangements. the company does not currently utilize any other off-balance sheet financing arrangements. the major facility leases are
typically for terms not exceeding 10 years and generally contain multi-year renewal options. leases for retail space are for terms ranging from five to 20 years, the majority of which are for 10 years, and often contain multi-year renewal options.
as of september 27, 2014, the companys total future minimum lease payments under noncancelable operating leases were $5.0 billion, of which $3.6 billion related to leases for retail space.rent expense under all operating leases, including both cancelable and noncancelable leases, was $717 million, $645 million and $488 million in 2014,
2013 and 2012, respectively. future minimum lease payments under noncancelable operating leases having remaining terms in excess of one year as of september 27, 2014, are as follows (in millions):20152016201720182019thereaftertotalapple inc. | 2014 form 10-k | 75



other commitmentsthe company utilizes several outsourcing partners to manufacture sub-assemblies for the companys products and to perform final assembly and testing
of finished products. these outsourcing partners acquire components and build product based on demand information supplied by the company, which typically covers periods up to 150 days. the company also obtains individual components for its products
from a wide variety of individual suppliers. consistent with industry practice, the company acquires components through a combination of purchase orders, supplier contracts and open orders based on projected demand information. where
appropriate, the purchases are applied to inventory component prepayments that are outstanding with the respective supplier. as of september 27, 2014, the company had outstanding off-balance sheet third-party
manufacturing commitments and component purchase commitments of $24.5 billion.in addition to the off-balance sheet commitments mentioned above, the
company had outstanding obligations of $3.4 billion as of september 27, 2014, which consisted mainly of commitments to acquire capital assets, including product tooling and manufacturing process equipment, and commitments related to
advertising, r&d, internet and telecommunications services and other obligations.contingenciesthe company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that have arisen in the ordinary course of business and that have not been fully
adjudicated. in the opinion of management, there was not at least a reasonable possibility the company may have incurred a material loss, or a material loss in excess of a recorded accrual, with respect to loss contingencies. however, the outcome of
litigation is inherently uncertain. therefore, although management considers the likelihood of such an outcome to be remote, if one or more of these legal matters were resolved against the company in a reporting period for amounts in excess of
managements expectations, the companys consolidated financial statements for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected.apple inc.

note 11  segment information and geographic datathe company reports segment information based on the management approach. the management approach designates the internal reporting used by
management for making decisions and assessing performance as the source of the companys reportable segments.the company manages its business
primarily on a geographic basis. the companys reportable operating segments consist of the americas, europe, greater china, japan, rest of asia pacific and retail operations. the americas segment includes both north and south america. the
europe segment includes european countries, as well as india, the middle east and africa. the greater china segment includes china, hong kong and taiwan. the rest of asia pacific segment includes australia and asian countries, other than those
countries included in the companys other operating segments. the results of the companys geographic segments do not include results of the retail segment. each operating segment provides similar hardware and software products and similar
services. the accounting policies of the various segments are the same as those described in note 1, summary of significant accounting policies.the company evaluates the performance of its operating segments based on net sales and operating income. net sales for geographic segments are generally
based on the location of customers, while retail segment net sales are based on sales through the companys retail stores. operating income for each segment includes net sales to third parties, related cost of sales and operating expenses
directly attributable to the segment. advertising expenses are generally included in the geographic segment in which the expenditures are incurred. operating income for each segment excludes other income and expense and certain expenses managed
outside the operating segments. costs excluded from segment operating income include various corporate expenses such as r&d, corporate marketing expenses, share-based compensation expense, income taxes, various nonrecurring charges, other
separately managed general and administrative costs and certain manufacturing period expenses. the company does not include intercompany transfers between segments for management reporting purposes.segment assets include receivables and inventories, and for the retail segment also includes capital assets. segment assets exclude corporate assets,
such as cash and cash equivalents, short-term and long-term marketable securities, vendor non-trade receivables, other long-term investments, manufacturing and corporate facilities, product tooling and manufacturing process equipment, miscellaneous
corporate infrastructure, goodwill and other acquired intangible assets. except for the retail segment, capital asset purchases for long-lived assets are not reported to management by segment and therefore are excluded from the geographic segment
assets and instead included in corporate assets. cash payments for capital asset purchases by the retail segment were $484 million, $495 million and $858 million for 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. the companys total depreciation and
amortization was $7.9 billion, $6.8 billion and $3.3 billion in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively, of which $441 million, $382 million and $319 million was related to the retail segment in the respective years. depreciation and amortization on
segment assets included in the geographic segments was not significant.as the company continues to expand its business, management believes
collaboration across its online, retail and indirect channels is integral to better serve its customers and optimize its financial results. beginning in the first quarter of 2015, management will be assessing business performance and making
decisions on a geographic basis, including the results of its retail stores in each respective geographic segment. accordingly, the company will be changing its reportable segments to align with the way the business is managed. the companys
reportable operating segments will consist of the americas, europe, greater china, japan and rest of asia pacific operations, and the retail segment will no longer be classified as a separate reportable segment. the historical segment data for prior
periods will be reclassified to reflect this change beginning in the quarterly report on form 10-q for the quarter ending december 27, 2014.apple inc. | 2014 form 10-k | 77

report of ernst & young llp, independent registered public accounting firmthe board of directors and shareholders of apple inc.we have audited apple inc.s internal control over financial reporting as of september 27, 2014, based on criteria established in internal
control  integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission (1992 framework) (the coso criteria). apple inc.s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal
control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying managements annual report on internal control over financial reporting. our responsibility
is to express an opinion on the companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.we conducted our audit in accordance
with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board (united states). those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was
maintained in all material respects. our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of
internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. we believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.a companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial
reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. a companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that
(1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as
necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors
of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. also, projections of any
evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.in our opinion, apple inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of september 27, 2014, based
on the coso criteria.we also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board (united states), the

none.evaluation of disclosure controls and proceduresbased on an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of the companys management, the companys principal executive officer
and principal financial officer have concluded that the companys disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the securities exchange act of 1934, as amended (the exchange act) were effective
as of september 27, 2014 to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by the company in reports that it files or submits under the exchange act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the
time periods specified in the securities and exchange commission rules and forms and (ii) accumulated and communicated to the companys management, including its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate
to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.inherent limitations over internal controlsthe companys internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles (gaap). the companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and
procedures that:pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the companys

companys receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of the companys management and directors; andprovide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could
have a material effect on the financial statements.management, including the companys chief executive officer and chief
financial officer, does not expect that the companys internal controls will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. a control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the
objectives of the control system are met. further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. because of the inherent limitations
in all control systems, no evaluation of internal controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. also, any evaluation of the effectiveness of controls in future periods are subject
to the risk that those internal controls may become inadequate because of changes in business conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.managements annual report on internal control over financial reportingthe companys management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in rule
13a-15(f) under the exchange act). management conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of the companys internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria set forth in internal control  integrated framework issued by the
committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission (1992 framework). based on the companys assessment, management has concluded that its internal control over financial reporting was effective as of september 27, 2014 to

# 2013 AAPL

## Item 1A


finance development and/or manufacture products resulting in product delays; inability of customers, including channel partners, to obtain credit to finance purchases of the
companys products; failure of derivative counterparties and other financial institutions; and restricting the companys ability to issue new debt. other income and expense also could vary materially from expectations depending on
gains or losses realized on the sale or exchange of financial instruments; impairment charges resulting from revaluations of debt and equity securities and other investments; interest rates; cash balances; volatility in foreign
exchange rates; and changes in fair value of derivative instruments. increased volatility in the financial markets and overall economic uncertainty would increase the risk of the actual amounts realized in the future on the
companys financial instruments differing significantly from the fair values currently assigned to them.global
markets for the companys products and services are highly competitive and subject to rapid technological change, and the company may be unable to compete effectively in these markets.the companys products and services compete in highly competitive global markets characterized by aggressive price cutting and
resulting downward pressure on gross margins, frequent introduction of new products, short product life cycles, evolving industry standards, continual improvement in product price/performance characteristics, rapid adoption of technological and
product advancements by competitors, and price sensitivity on the part of consumers.the companys ability to compete
successfully depends heavily on its ability to ensure a continuing and timely introduction of innovative new products and technologies to the marketplace. the company believes it is unique in that it designs and develops nearly the entire solution
for its products, including the hardware, operating system, numerous software applications, and related services. as a result, the company must make significant investments in research and development. the company currently holds a significant
number of patents and copyrights and has registered and/or has applied to register numerous patents, trademarks and service marks. in contrast, many of the companys competitors seek to compete primarily through aggressive pricing and very low
cost structures, and emulating the companys products and infringing on its intellectual property. if the company is unable to continue to develop and sell innovative new products with attractive margins or if competitors
infringe on the companys intellectual property, the companys ability to maintain a competitive advantage could be adversely affected.the company markets certain mobile communication and media devices based on the ios mobile operating system and also markets related third-party digital content and applications. the company faces
substantial competition in these markets from companies that have significant technical, marketing, distribution and other resources, as well as established hardware, software and digital content supplier relationships; and the company has a
minority market share in the smartphone market. additionally, the company faces significant price competition as competitors reduce their selling prices and attempt to imitate the companys product features and applications within their own
products or, alternatively, collaborate with each other to offer solutions that are more competitive than those they currently offer. the company also competes with illegitimate ways to obtain third-party digital content and applications. some of
the companys competitors have greater experience, product breadth and distribution channels than the company. because some current and potential competitors have substantial resources and/or experience and a lower cost structure, they may be
able to provide products and services at little or no profit or even at a loss. the company also expects competition to intensify as competitors attempt to imitate the companys approach to providing components seamlessly within their
individual offerings or work collaboratively to offer integrated solutions. the companys financial condition and operating results depend substantially on the companys ability to continually improve ios and ios devices in order to
maintain their functional and design advantages.the company is the only authorized maker of hardware using os x, which has a
minority market share in the personal computer market. this market is dominated by computer makers using competing operating systems, most notably windows. in the market for personal computers and peripherals, the company faces a significant number
of competitors, many of which have broader product lines, lower priced products, and a larger installed10



customer base. historically, consolidation in this market has resulted in larger competitors. price competition has been particularly intense as competitors selling windows-based personal
computers have aggressively cut prices and lowered product margins. an increasing number of internet-enabled devices that include software applications and are smaller and simpler than traditional personal computers compete for market share with the
companys existing products. the companys financial condition and operating results also depend on its ability to continually improve the mac platform to maintain its functional and design advantages.there can be no assurance the company will be able to continue to provide products and services that compete effectively.to remain competitive and stimulate customer demand, the company must successfully manage frequent product introductions and
transitions.due to the highly volatile and competitive nature of the industries in which the company competes, the
company must continually introduce new products, services and technologies, enhance existing products and services, and effectively stimulate customer demand for new and upgraded products. the success of new product introductions depends on a number
of factors including, but not limited to, timely and successful product development, market acceptance, the companys ability to manage the risks associated with new product production ramp-up issues, the availability of application software
for new products, the effective management of purchase commitments and inventory levels in line with anticipated product demand, the availability of products in appropriate quantities and costs to meet anticipated demand, and the risk that new
products may have quality or other defects or deficiencies in the early stages of introduction. accordingly, the company cannot determine in advance the ultimate effect of new product introductions and transitions.the company depends on the performance of distributors, carriers and other resellers.the company distributes its products through cellular network carriers, wholesalers, national and regional retailers, and value-added
resellers, many of whom distribute products from competing manufacturers. the company also sells its products and third-party products in most of its major markets directly to education, enterprise and government customers, and consumers and small
and mid-sized businesses through its online and retail stores.carriers providing cellular network service for iphone
typically subsidize users purchases of the device. there is no assurance that such subsidies will be continued at all or in the same amounts upon renewal of the companys agreements with these carriers or in agreements the company enters
into with new carriers.many resellers have narrow operating margins and have been adversely affected in the past by weak
economic conditions. some resellers have perceived the expansion of the companys direct sales as conflicting with their business interests as distributors and resellers of the companys products. such a perception could discourage
resellers from investing resources in the distribution and sale of the companys products or lead them to limit or cease distribution of those products. the company has invested and will continue to invest in programs to enhance reseller sales,
including staffing selected resellers stores with company employees and contractors and improving product placement displays. these programs could require a substantial investment while providing no assurance of return or incremental revenue.
the financial condition of these resellers could weaken, these resellers could stop distributing the companys products, or uncertainty regarding demand for the companys products could cause resellers to reduce their ordering and
marketing of the companys products.the company faces substantial inventory and other asset risk in addition to
purchase commitment cancellation risk.the company records a write-down for product and component inventories that have
become obsolete or exceed anticipated demand or net realizable value and accrues necessary cancellation fee reserves for orders of excess products and components. the company also reviews its long-lived assets, including capital assets held at its
suppliers facilities and inventory prepayments, for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate the11



carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. if the company determines that impairment has occurred, it records a write-down equal to the amount by which the carrying value of the assets
exceeds its fair value. although the company believes its provisions related to inventory, capital assets, inventory prepayments and other assets and purchase commitments are currently adequate, no assurance can be given that the company will not
incur additional related charges given the rapid and unpredictable pace of product obsolescence in the industries in which the company competes.the company must order components for its products and build inventory in advance of product announcements and shipments. consistent with industry practice, components are normally acquired through a
combination of purchase orders, supplier contracts, and open orders, in each case based on projected demand. where appropriate, the purchases are applied to inventory component prepayments that are outstanding with
the respective supplier. purchase commitments typically cover forecasted component and manufacturing requirements for periods up to 150 days. because the companys markets are volatile, competitive and subject to rapid technology and price
changes, there is a risk the company will forecast incorrectly and order or produce excess or insufficient amounts of components or products, or not fully utilize firm purchase commitments.future operating results depend upon the companys ability to obtain components in sufficient quantities.because the company currently obtains components from single or limited sources, the company is subject to significant supply and pricing
risks. many components, including those that are available from multiple sources, are at times subject to industry-wide shortages and significant commodity pricing fluctuations. while the company has entered into various agreements for the supply of
components, there can be no assurance that the company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms, or at all. the follow-on effects from global economic conditions on the companys suppliers, described in
global economic conditions could materially adversely affect the company above, also could affect the companys ability to obtain components. therefore, the company remains subject to significant risks of supply
shortages and price increases.the company and other participants in the markets for mobile communication and media devices
and personal computers also compete for various components with other industries that have experienced increased demand for their products. the company uses some custom components that are not common to the rest of these industries. the
companys new products often utilize custom components available from only one source. when a component or product uses new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers yields have matured or manufacturing
capacity has increased. continued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at all, may be affected if those suppliers decided to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the
companys requirements. the supply of components for a new or existing product could be delayed or constrained, or a key manufacturing vendor could delay shipments of completed products to the company.the company depends on component and product manufacturing and logistical services provided by outsourcing partners, many of whom are
located outside of the u.s.substantially all of the companys manufacturing is performed in whole or in part by a
few outsourcing partners located primarily in asia. the company has also outsourced much of its transportation and logistics management. while these arrangements may lower operating costs, they also reduce the companys direct control over
production and distribution. it is uncertain what effect such diminished control will have on the quality or quantity of products or services, or the companys flexibility to respond to changing conditions. although arrangements with these
partners may contain provisions for warranty expense reimbursement, the company may remain responsible to the consumer for warranty service in the event of product defects and could experience an unanticipated product defect or warranty liability.
while the company relies on its partners to adhere to its supplier code of conduct, material violations of the supplier code of conduct could occur.the company relies on sole-sourced outsourcing partners in the u.s., asia and europe to supply and manufacture many critical components, and on outsourcing partners in asia for final assembly of
substantially all12



of the companys hardware products. any failure of these partners to perform may have a negative impact on the companys cost or supply of components or finished goods. in addition,
manufacturing or logistics in these locations or transit to final destinations may be disrupted for a variety of reasons including, but not limited to, natural and man-made disasters, information technology system failures, commercial disputes,
military actions or economic, business, labor, environmental, public health, or political issues.the company has invested in
manufacturing process equipment, much of which is held at certain of its outsourcing partners, and has made prepayments to certain of its suppliers associated with long-term supply agreements. while these arrangements help ensure the supply of
components and finished goods, if these outsourcing partners or suppliers experience severe financial problems or other disruptions in their business, the net realizable value of these assets could be negatively impacted.the companys products and services may experience quality problems from time to time that can result in decreased sales and
operating margin and harm to the companys reputation.the company sells complex hardware and software products and
services that can contain design and manufacturing defects. sophisticated operating system software and applications, such as those sold by the company, often contain bugs that can unexpectedly interfere with the softwares intended
operation. the companys online services may from time to time experience outages, service slowdowns, or errors. defects may also occur in components and products the company purchases from third parties. there can be no assurance the company
will be able to detect and fix all defects in the hardware, software and services it sells. failure to do so could result in lost revenue, significant warranty and other expenses, and harm to the companys reputation.the company relies on access to third-party digital content, which may not be available to the company on commercially reasonable
terms or at all.the company contracts with numerous third parties to offer their digital content through the itunes
store. this includes the right to make available music, movies, tv shows and books currently available through the itunes store. the licensing arrangements with these third parties are short-term and do not guarantee the continuation or renewal of
these arrangements on reasonable terms, if at all. some third-party content providers and distributors currently or in the future may offer competing products and services, and could take action to make it more difficult or impossible for the
company to license their content in the future. other content owners, providers or distributors may seek to limit the companys access to, or increase the cost of, such content. the company may be unable to continue to offer a wide variety of
content at reasonable prices with acceptable usage rules, or continue to expand its geographic reach. failure to obtain the right to make available third-party digital content, or to make available such content on commercially reasonable terms,
could have a material adverse impact on the companys financial condition and operating results.some third-party
digital content providers require the company to provide digital rights management and other security solutions. if requirements change, the company may have to develop or license new technology to provide these solutions. there is no assurance the
company will be able to develop or license such solutions at a reasonable cost and in a timely manner. in addition, certain countries have passed or may propose and adopt legislation that would force the company to license its digital rights
management, which could lessen the protection of content and subject it to piracy and also could negatively affect arrangements with the companys content providers.the companys future performance depends in part on support from third-party software developers.the company believes decisions by customers to purchase its hardware products depend in part on the availability of third-party software applications and services. there is no assurance that third-party developers will continue to develop and maintain software applications and services for the companys products. if
third-party software applications and services cease to be developed and maintained for the companys products, customers may choose not to buy the companys products.13



with respect to its mac products, the company believes the availability of third-party software applications and services depends in part on the developers perception and analysis of the relative benefits of developing, maintaining, and upgrading such software for the companys
products compared to windows-based products. this analysis may be based on factors such as the market position of the company and its products, the anticipated revenue that may be generated, continued growth of mac sales, and the costs of developing
such applications and services. if the companys minority share of the global personal computer market causes developers to question the companys prospects, developers could be less inclined to develop or upgrade software for the
companys products and more inclined to devote their resources to developing and upgrading software for the larger windows market.with respect to ios devices, the company relies on the continued availability and development of compelling and innovative software applications, which are distributed through a single distribution
channel, the app store. the absence of multiple distribution channels, which are available for competing platforms, may limit the availability and acceptance of third-party applications by the companys customers, thereby causing developers to
reduce or curtail development for the ios platform. in addition, ios devices are subject to rapid technological change, and, if third-party developers are unable to or choose not to keep up with this pace of change, third-party applications might
not successfully operate and may result in dissatisfied customers. as with applications for the companys mac products, the availability and development of these applications also depend on developers perceptions and analysis of the
relative benefits of developing software for the companys products rather than its competitors platforms, such as android. if developers focus their efforts on these competing platforms, the availability and quality of applications for
the companys ios devices may suffer.the company relies on access to third-party intellectual property, which may
not be available to the company on commercially reasonable terms or at all.many of the companys products include
third-party intellectual property, which requires licenses from those third parties. based on past experience and industry practice, the company believes such licenses generally can be obtained on reasonable terms. there is, however, no assurance
that the necessary licenses can be obtained on acceptable terms or at all. failure to obtain the right to use third-party intellectual property, or to use such intellectual property on commercially reasonable terms, could preclude the company from
selling certain products or otherwise have a material adverse impact on the companys financial condition and operating results.the company could be impacted by unfavorable results of legal proceedings, such as being found to have infringed on intellectual property rights.the company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that have not yet been fully resolved and that have arisen in the ordinary
course of business, and additional claims may arise in the future.for example, technology companies, including many of the
companys competitors, frequently enter into litigation based on allegations of patent infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. in addition, patent holding companies seek to monetize patents they have purchased or
otherwise obtained. as the company has grown, the intellectual property rights claims against it have increased and may continue to increase. in particular, the companys cellular enabled products compete with mobile communication and media
device companies that hold significant patent portfolios, and the number of patent claims against the company has significantly increased. the company is vigorously defending infringement actions in courts in a number of u.s. jurisdictions and
before the u.s. international trade commission, as well as internationally in europe and asia. the plaintiffs in these actions frequently seek injunctions and substantial damages.regardless of the scope or validity of such patents or other intellectual property rights, or the merits of any claims by potential
or actual litigants, the company may have to engage in protracted litigation. if the company is found to infringe one or more patents or other intellectual property rights, regardless of whether it can develop non-infringing technology, it may be
required to pay substantial damages or royalties to a third-party, or it may be subject to a temporary or permanent injunction prohibiting the company from marketing or selling certain products.14



in certain cases, the company may consider the desirability of entering into licensing
agreements, although no assurance can be given that such licenses can be obtained on acceptable terms or that litigation will not occur. these licenses may also significantly increase the companys operating expenses.regardless of the merit of particular claims, litigation may be expensive, time-consuming, disruptive to the companys operations,
and distracting to management. in recognition of these considerations, the company may enter into arrangements to settle litigation.in managements opinion, there is not at least a reasonable possibility the company may have incurred a material loss, or a material loss in excess of a recorded accrual, with respect to loss
contingencies, including matters related to infringement of intellectual property rights. however, the outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain.although management considers the likelihood of such an outcome to be remote, if one or more legal matters were resolved against the company in a reporting period for amounts in excess of
managements expectations, the companys consolidated financial statements for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected. further, such an outcome could result in significant compensatory, punitive or trebled monetary
damages, disgorgement of revenue or profits, remedial corporate measures or injunctive relief against the company that could materially adversely affect its financial condition and operating results.the company is subject to laws and regulations worldwide, changes to which could increase the companys costs and individually or
in the aggregate adversely affect the companys business.the company is subject to laws and regulations affecting
its domestic and international operations in a number of areas. these u.s. and foreign laws and regulations affect the companys activities including, but not limited to, areas of labor, advertising, digital content, consumer protection,
real estate, billing, e-commerce, promotions, quality of services, telecommunications, mobile communications and media, television, intellectual property ownership and infringement, tax, import and export requirements, anti-corruption, foreign
exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions, data privacy requirements, anti-competition, environmental, health, and safety.by way of example, laws and regulations related to mobile communications and media devices in the many jurisdictions in which the company operates are extensive and subject to change. such changes could
include, among others, restrictions on the production, manufacture, distribution, and use of devices, locking devices to a carriers network, or mandating the use of devices on more than one carriers network. these devices are also
subject to certification and regulation by governmental and standardization bodies, as well as by cellular network carriers for use on their networks. these certification processes are extensive and time consuming, and could result in
additional testing requirements, product modifications, delays in product shipment dates, or preclude the company from selling certain products.compliance with these laws, regulations and similar requirements may be onerous and expensive, and they may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, further increasing the cost of compliance and
doing business. any such costs, which may rise in the future as a result of changes in these laws and regulations or in their interpretation could individually or in the aggregate make the companys products and services less attractive to the
companys customers, delay the introduction of new products in one or more regions, or cause the company to change or limit its business practices. the company has implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with
applicable laws and regulations, but there can be no assurance that the companys employees, contractors, or agents will not violate such laws and regulations or the companys policies and procedures.the companys business is subject to the risks of international operations.the company derives a significant portion of its revenue and earnings from its international operations. compliance with applicable u.s.
and foreign laws and regulations, such as import and export requirements, anti-corruption laws, tax laws, foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions, data privacy requirements,15



environmental laws, labor laws, and anti-competition regulations, increases the costs of doing business in foreign jurisdictions. although the company has implemented policies and procedures to
comply with these laws and regulations, a violation by the companys employees, contractors, or agents could nevertheless occur.the company also could be significantly affected by other risks associated with international activities including, but not limited to, economic and labor conditions, increased duties, taxes and other
costs, and political instability. margins on sales of the companys products in foreign countries, and on sales of products that include components obtained from foreign suppliers, could be materially adversely affected by international trade
regulations, including duties, tariffs and antidumping penalties. the company is also exposed to credit and collectability risk on its trade receivables with customers in certain international markets. there can be no assurance the company can
effectively limit its credit risk and avoid losses.the companys retail segment has required and will continue to
require a substantial investment and commitment of resources and is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties.the
companys retail stores have required substantial investment in equipment and leasehold improvements, information systems, inventory and personnel. the company also has entered into substantial operating lease commitments for retail space.
certain stores have been designed and built to serve as high-profile venues to promote brand awareness and serve as vehicles for corporate sales and marketing activities. because of their unique design elements, locations and size, these stores
require substantially more investment than the companys more typical retail stores. due to the high cost structure associated with the retail segment, a decline in sales or the closure or poor performance of individual or multiple stores could
result in significant lease termination costs, write-offs of equipment and leasehold improvements, and severance costs.many
factors unique to retail operations, some of which are beyond the companys control, pose risks and uncertainties. these risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, macro-economic factors that could have an adverse effect on
general retail activity, as well as the companys inability to manage costs associated with store construction and operation, the companys failure to manage relationships with its existing retail channel partners, more challenging
environments in managing retail operations outside the u.s., costs associated with unanticipated fluctuations in the value of retail inventory, and the companys inability to obtain and renew leases in quality retail locations at a reasonable
cost.investment in new business strategies and acquisitions could disrupt the companys ongoing business and present
risks not originally contemplated.the company has invested, and in the future may invest, in new business strategies or
acquisitions. such endeavors may involve significant risks and uncertainties, including distraction of management from current operations, greater than expected liabilities and expenses, inadequate return of capital, and unidentified issues not
discovered in the companys due diligence. these new ventures are inherently risky and may not be successful.the
companys business and reputation may be impacted by information technology system failures or network disruptions.the company may be subject to information technology system failures and network disruptions. these may be caused by natural disasters,
accidents, power disruptions, telecommunications failures, acts of terrorism or war, computer viruses, physical or electronic break-ins, or other events or disruptions. system redundancy may be ineffective or inadequate, and the companys
disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities. such failures or disruptions could prevent access to the companys online stores and services, preclude retail store transactions, compromise company or customer data, and
result in delayed or cancelled orders. system failures and disruptions could also impede the manufacturing and shipping of products, delivery of online services, transactions processing and financial reporting.16



there may be breaches of the companys information technology systems that
materially damage business partner and customer relationships, curtail or otherwise adversely impact access to online stores and services, or subject the company to significant reputational, financial, legal, and operational consequences.the companys business requires it to use and store customer, employee, and business partner personally identifiable
information (pii). this may include, among other information, names, addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, contact preferences, tax identification numbers, and payment account information. although malicious attacks to gain access
to pii affect many companies across various industries, the company is at a relatively greater risk of being targeted because of its high profile and the amount of pii it manages.the company requires user names and passwords in order to access its information technology systems. the company also uses encryption and
authentication technologies to secure the transmission and storage of data and prevent access to company data or accounts. as with all companies, these security measures are subject to third-party security breaches, employee error, malfeasance,
faulty password management, or other irregularities. for example, third parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees or customers into disclosing user names, passwords or other sensitive information, which may in turn be used to access the
companys information technology systems. to help protect customers and the company, the company monitors accounts and systems for unusual activity and may freeze accounts under suspicious circumstances, which may result in the delay or loss of
customer orders.the company devotes significant resources to network security, data encryption, and other security measures
to protect its systems and data, but these security measures cannot provide absolute security. to the extent the company was to experience a breach of its systems and was unable to protect sensitive data, such a breach could materially damage
business partner and customer relationships, and curtail or otherwise adversely impact access to online stores and services. moreover, if a computer security breach affects the companys systems or results in the unauthorized release of pii,
the companys reputation and brand could be materially damaged, use of the companys products and services could decrease, and the company could be exposed to a risk of loss or litigation and possible liability.the companys business is subject to a variety of u.s. and international laws, rules, policies and other obligations regarding
data protection.the company is subject to federal, state and international laws relating to the collection, use,
retention, security and transfer of pii. in many cases, these laws apply not only to third-party transactions, but also to transfers of information between the company and its subsidiaries, and among the company, its subsidiaries and other parties
with which the company has commercial relations. several jurisdictions have passed laws in this area, and other jurisdictions are considering imposing additional restrictions. these laws continue to develop and may be inconsistent from jurisdiction
to jurisdiction. complying with emerging and changing international requirements may cause the company to incur substantial costs or require the company to change its business practices. noncompliance could result in penalties or significant legal
liability.the companys privacy policy and related practices concerning the use and disclosure of data are posted on
its website. any failure by the company, its suppliers or other parties with whom the company does business to comply with its posted privacy policy or with other federal, state or international privacy-related or data protection laws and
regulations could result in proceedings against the company by governmental entities or others.the company is also subject
to payment card association rules and obligations under its contracts with payment card processors. under these rules and obligations, if information is compromised, the company could be liable to payment card issuers for associated expenses and
penalties. in addition, if the company fails to follow payment card industry security standards, even if no customer information is compromised, the company could incur significant fines or experience a significant increase in payment card
transaction costs.17



the companys success depends largely on the continued service and availability of
key personnel.much of the companys future success depends on the continued availability and service of key
personnel, including its chief executive officer, executive team and other highly skilled employees. experienced personnel in the technology industry are in high demand and competition for their talents is intense, especially in silicon valley,
where most of the companys key personnel are located.the companys business may be impacted by political
events, war, terrorism, public health issues, natural disasters and other circumstances.war, terrorism, geopolitical
uncertainties, public health issues, and other business interruptions have caused and could cause damage or disruption to international commerce and the global economy, and thus could have a material adverse effect on the company, its suppliers,
logistics providers, manufacturing vendors and customers, including channel partners. the companys business operations are subject to interruption by, among others, natural disasters, fire, power shortages, nuclear power plant accidents,
terrorist attacks and other hostile acts, labor disputes, public health issues, and other events beyond its control. such events could decrease demand for the companys products, make it difficult or impossible for the company to make and
deliver products to its customers, including channel partners, or to receive components from its suppliers, and create delays and inefficiencies in the companys supply chain. should major public health issues, including pandemics, arise, the
company could be adversely affected by more stringent employee travel restrictions, additional limitations in freight services, governmental actions limiting the movement of products between regions, delays in production ramps of new products, and
disruptions in the operations of the companys manufacturing vendors and component suppliers. the majority of the companys research and development activities, its corporate headquarters, information technology systems, and other critical
business operations, including certain component suppliers and manufacturing vendors, are in locations that could be affected by natural disasters. in the event of a natural disaster, the company could incur significant losses, require substantial
recovery time and experience significant expenditures in order to resume operations.the company expects its quarterly
revenue and operating results to fluctuate.the companys profit margins vary across its products and distribution
channels. the companys software, accessories, and service and support contracts generally have higher gross margins than certain of the companys other products. gross margins on the companys hardware products vary across product
lines and can change over time as a result of product transitions, pricing and configuration changes, and component, warranty, and other cost fluctuations. the companys direct sales generally have higher associated gross margins than its
indirect sales through its channel partners. in addition, the companys gross margin and operating margin percentages, as well as overall profitability, may be materially adversely impacted as a result of a shift in product, geographic or
channel mix, component cost increases, the strengthening u.s. dollar, price competition, or the introduction of new products, including those that have higher cost structures with flat or reduced pricing.the company has typically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters due in part to seasonal holiday
demand. additionally, new product introductions can significantly impact net sales, product costs and operating expenses. the company could be subject to unexpected developments late in a quarter, such as lower-than-anticipated demand for the
companys products, issues with new product introductions, an internal systems failure, or failure of one of the companys logistics, components supply, or manufacturing partners.the companys stock price is subject to volatility.the companys stock continues to experience substantial price volatility. additionally, the company, the technology industry, and the stock market as a whole have experienced extreme stock price and
volume fluctuations that have affected stock prices in ways that may have been unrelated to these companies operating performance. price volatility over a given period may cause the average price at which the company repurchases its own stock
to exceed the stocks price at a given point in time. the company believes its stock price reflects18



expectations of future growth and profitability. the company also believes its stock price reflects expectations that its cash dividend will continue at current levels or grow and that its
current share repurchase program will be fully consummated. future dividends are subject to declaration by the companys board of directors, and the companys share repurchase program does not obligate it to acquire any specific number of
shares. if the company fails to meet any of these expectations related to future growth, profitability, dividends, share repurchases or other market expectations its stock price may decline significantly, which could have a material adverse impact
on investor confidence and employee retention.the companys financial performance is subject to risks associated
with changes in the value of the u.s. dollar versus local currencies.the companys primary exposure to movements in
foreign currency exchange rates relates to non-u.s. dollar denominated sales and operating expenses worldwide. weakening of foreign currencies relative to the u.s. dollar adversely affects the u.s. dollar value of the companys foreign
currency-denominated sales and earnings, and generally leads the company to raise international pricing, potentially reducing demand for the companys products. margins on sales of the companys products in foreign countries, and on sales
of products that include components obtained from foreign suppliers, could be materially adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. in some circumstances, for competitive or other reasons, the company may decide not to raise
local prices to fully offset the dollars strengthening, or at all, which would adversely affect the u.s. dollar value of the companys foreign currency denominated sales and earnings. conversely, a strengthening of foreign currencies
relative to the u.s. dollar, while generally beneficial to the companys foreign currency-denominated sales and earnings, could cause the company to reduce international pricing and incur losses on its foreign currency derivative instruments,
thereby limiting the benefit. additionally, strengthening of foreign currencies may also increase the companys cost of product components denominated in those currencies, thus adversely affecting gross margins.the company uses derivative instruments, such as foreign currency forward and option contracts, to hedge certain exposures to
fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. the use of such hedging activities may not offset any or more than a portion of the adverse financial effects of unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates over the limited time the hedges are in
place.the company is exposed to credit risk and fluctuations in the market values of its investment portfolio.given the global nature of its business, the company has both domestic and international investments. credit ratings and
pricing of the companys investments can be negatively affected by liquidity, credit deterioration, financial results, economic risk, political risk, sovereign risk or other factors. as a result, the value and liquidity of the companys
cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities may fluctuate substantially. therefore, although the company has not realized any significant losses on its cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, future fluctuations in their value could
result in a significant realized loss.the company is exposed to credit risk on its trade accounts receivable, vendor
non-trade receivables and prepayments related to long-term supply agreements, and this risk is heightened during periods when economic conditions worsen.the company distributes its products through third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers and value-added resellers. a substantial majority of the companys outstanding trade
receivables are not covered by collateral or credit insurance. the companys exposure to credit and collectability risk on its trade receivables is higher in certain international markets and its ability to mitigate such risks may be limited.
the company also has unsecured vendor non-trade receivables resulting from purchases of components by outsourcing partners and other vendors that manufacture sub-assemblies or assemble final products for the company. in addition, the company has
made prepayments associated with long-term supply agreements to secure supply of inventory components. as of september 28, 2013, a significant portion of the companys trade receivables was19


## Item 6

## Item 7


in april 2013 the company announced a significant increase to its program to return capital
to shareholders by raising the total amount it expected to utilize for the program through december 2015 to $100 billion. this included increasing its share repurchase authorization to $60 billion and raising its quarterly dividend to $3.05 per
common share beginning in may 2013. during 2013, the company utilized $23.0 billion to repurchase common shares and paid dividends of $10.5 billion or $11.40 per common share. in conjunction with its capital return program, in may 2013 the company
issued $17.0 billion of notes with varying maturities through 2043.fiscal 2012 highlightsoverall net sales during 2012 increased $48.3 billion or 45% compared to 2011. all of the companys operating segments experienced
increased net sales during 2012, primarily a result of strong demand for iphone and ipad. growth in total net sales was particularly strong during the first six months of 2012, rising $34.1 billion or 66% compared to the same period in 2011. the net
sales growth during the first six months of 2012 reflected the launch of iphone 4s in the first quarter of 2012 and the companys ability to meet demand more quickly for iphone 4s when compared to the iphone 4 launch. growth during the first
half of 2012 was also favorably impacted by strong unit sales of ipad during the holiday season, resulting in a 111% increase in ipad unit sales during the first quarter of 2012 compared to the same quarter in 2011. partially offsetting these
positive factors was a decrease in ipod net sales experienced across all operating segments.in october 2011, the company
introduced iphone 4s and launched icloud, the companys cloud service that stores user data and keeps it up to date and available on multiple ios devices and mac and windows personal computers. the company introduced the third generation ipad
with retina display in march 2012 and in june 2012 introduced the macbook pro with retina display and an updated macbook air during the fourth quarter of 2012, os x mountain lion was released and iphone 5 was introduced.in march 2012, the company announced a $10 billion share repurchase program that would be executed over three years and announced plans
to initiate a quarterly dividend commencing in the fourth quarter of 2012. during the fourth quarter, the company paid dividends of $2.5 billion or $2.65 per common share.26

information for 2013, 2012 and 2011 (net sales in millions and units in thousands):net salespercentage of total net salesunit salesthe growth in iphone net sales and unit sales during 2013 resulted from increased demand for iphone in
all of the companys operating segments primarily due to the launch of iphone 5 beginning in september 2012 and strong ongoing demand for iphone 4 and 4s. all of the companys operating segments experienced increases in net sales and unit
sales of iphone during 2013 compared to 2012. the year-over-year impact of higher iphone unit sales in 2013 was partially offset by a 3% decline in iphone average selling prices (asps) in 2013 compared to 2012 primarily as a result of a
shift in product mix towards lower-priced iphone models, particularly iphone 4. all of the companys geographic operating segments experienced a decline in iphone asps during 2013.the year-over-year growth in iphone net sales and unit sales during 2012 reflects strong demand for iphone in all of the companys
operating segments, except for the rest of asia pacific segment. growth in iphone sales during 2012 is primarily a result of the launches of iphone 4s in the first quarter of 2012 and iphone 5 in the fourth quarter of 2012, ongoing demand during
2012 for iphone 4 and iphone 3gs, and expanded distribution with new carriers and resellers.ipadthe following table presents ipad net sales and unit sales information for 2013, 2012 and 2011 (net sales in millions and units in

of the companys operating segments. this growth was driven by the launch of ipad mini and the fourth generation ipad beginning in the first quarter of 2013. the year-over-year growth rate of total ipad unit sales was significantly higher than
the growth rate of total ipad net sales for 2013 due to a reduction in ipad asps of 15% in 2013 compared to 2012. this decline resulted primarily from introduction of the lower priced ipad mini and the full year impact of the price reduction on ipad
2 made in 2012. the decline in ipad asps was experienced to various degrees by all of the companys operating segments.the year-over-year increase in ipad net sales and unit sales during 2012 was driven by strong demand for ipad in all of the
companys operating segments as a result of the launch of the third generation ipad in march 2012, continued demand for ipad 2, and expanded distribution with new resellers. the year-over-year growth rate of ipad unit sales was higher than the
growth rate of ipad net sales during 2012 due to a 10% reduction in asps as a result of a shift in product mix toward lower-priced ipad models, a price reduction on ipad 2 and an increase in indirect sales due to expanded distribution through
third-party resellers.28

companys operating segments driven by 2012 releases of updated models of macbook air and macbook pro, including macbook pro with retina display in june 2012. partially offsetting the increase in net sales of mac portables was a decline in net
sales of mac desktops that reflected the overall decline in the market for desktop personal computers during 2012. additionally, the company did not introduce updated versions of its mac desktop products in 2012.itunes, software and servicesthe following table presents net sales information of itunes, software and services for 2013, 2012 and 2011 (in millions):itunes, software and servicespercentage of total net salesthe increase in net sales of itunes, software and services in 2013 compared to 2012 was primarily due to
growth in net sales from the itunes store, applecare and licensing. the itunes store generated a total of $9.3 billion in net sales during 2013, a 24% increase from 2012. growth in the itunes store, which includes the app store, the mac app store
and the ibooks store, reflects continued growth in the installed base of ios devices, expanded offerings of ios apps and related in-app purchases, and expanded offerings of itunes digital content.the increase in net sales of itunes, software and services in 2012 compared to 2011 was due primarily to growth of the itunes store,
which generated total net sales of $7.5 billion for 2012 compared to net sales of $5.4 billion during 2011. the strong results of the itunes store in 2012 reflect growth of the app store; growth of the companys customer base; and the continued
expansion of third-party audio, video and book content available for sale or rent via the itunes store.29

europe segment to the extent it did in other segments. lower year-over-year growth in net sales in the europe segment during 2012 compared to the companys other geographic segments reflects growth in iphone unit sales that was well below the

introductions during the year, iphone 5 in december 2012 and iphone 5c and iphone 5s in september 2013. further contributing to the growth in 2013 was the introduction of the fourth generation ipad and ipad mini during the second quarter of 2013 and
an increase in iphone channel inventory as of the end of 2013 compared to the end of 2012. while net sales in the china segment were up 13% for all of 2013, net sales for the second half of 2013 declined 4% compared to the second half of 2012.the growth in net sales during 2012 was mainly due to increased demand for iphone following the launch of iphone 4s and
strong demand for the third generation ipad and ipad 2. growth in the greater china segment was affected by the timing of iphone and ipad product launches. iphone 5 was not launched in china during 2012, and the third generation ipad that was
introduced by the company in march 2012 was not launched in china until the fourth quarter of 2012.japanthe following table presents japan net sales information for 2013, 2012 and 2011 (in millions):net salespercentage of total net salesthe increase in net sales in the japan segment during 2013 reflects significant increases in unit volumes

the growth in net sales during 2012 was mainly due to strong demand for the third generation
ipad. the rest of asia pacific segment experienced significantly lower year-over-year growth in net sales compared to all of the companys other operating segments due primarily to a decrease in iphone sales. this decrease reflects the timing
of iphone 5 launches in the rest of asia pacific segment, which only occurred in a limited number of countries during the fourth quarter of 2012.retailthe following table presents retail net sales information for 2013,
2012 and 2011 (in millions, except for store counts):net salespercentage of total net salesu.s. storesinternational storestotal store countthe growth in net sales during 2013 was primarily driven by increased unit sales of iphone and ipad
following the new product introductions in the first half of 2013 and increased sales of services. with an average of 403 and 365 open stores during 2013 and 2012, respectively, average revenue per store decreased to $50.2 million in 2013, compared
to $51.5 million in 2012.the growth in net sales during 2012 was driven primarily by increased demand for iphone following
the launches of iphone 4s and iphone 5, strong demand for the third generation ipad and ipad 2, and higher mac net sales. lower year-over-year growth in net sales in the retail segment during 2012 compared to the companys other segments
reflects the significant growth in ipad indirect distribution channel expansion. with an average of 365 stores and 326 stores during 2012 and 2011, respectively, average revenue per store increased 19% to $51.5 million in 2012 compared to $43.3
million in 2011.the retail segments operating income was $4.0 billion, $4.6 billion and $3.1 billion during 2013,
2012, and 2011, respectively. the year-over-year decrease in retail operating income in 2013 is primarily attributable to lower gross margin similar to that experienced by the company overall, partially offset by higher net sales. the year-over-year
increase in retail operating income in 2012 is primarily attributable to higher overall net sales that resulted in significantly higher average revenue per store during 2012.gross margingross margin for 2013, 2012 and 2011 are as follows (in

gross margin in 2013 compared to 2012 was driven by multiple factors including introduction of new versions of existing products with higher cost structures and flat or reduced pricing; a shift in sales mix to products with lower margins;
introduction of ipad mini with gross margin significantly below the companys average product margins; higher expenses associated with changes to certain of the companys service policies and other32

warranty costs; price reductions on certain products, including ipad 2 and iphone 4; and unfavorable impact from foreign exchange fluctuations.the gross margin percentage in 2012 was 43.9%, compared to 40.5% in 2011. this year-over-year increase in gross margin was largely driven
by lower commodity and other product costs, a higher mix of iphone sales, and improved leverage on fixed costs from higher net sales. the increase in gross margin was partially offset by the impact of a stronger u.s. dollar. the gross margin
percentage during the first half of 2012 was 45.9% compared to 41.4% during the second half of 2012. the primary drivers of higher gross margin in the first half of 2012 compared to the second half are a higher mix of iphone sales and improved
leverage on fixed costs from higher net sales. additionally, gross margin in the second half of 2012 was also affected by the introduction of new products with flat pricing that have higher cost structures and deliver greater value to
customers, price reductions on certain existing products, higher transition costs associated with product launches, and continued strengthening of the u.s. dollar; partially offset by lower commodity costs.the company anticipates gross margin during the first quarter of 2014 to be between 36.5% and 37.5%. the foregoing statement regarding
the companys expected gross margin percentage in the first quarter of 2014 is forward-looking and could differ from actual results. the companys future gross margin can be impacted by multiple factors including, but not limited to those
set forth above in part i, item 1a of this form 10-k under the heading risk factors and those described in this paragraph. in general, gross margins and margins on individual products will remain under downward pressure due to a variety
of factors, including continued industry wide global product pricing pressures, increased competition, compressed product life cycles, product transitions, potential increases in the cost of components, and potential strengthening of the u.s.
dollar, as well as potential increases in the costs of outside manufacturing services and a potential shift in the companys sales mix towards products with lower gross margins. in response to competitive pressures, the company expects
it will continue to take product pricing actions, which would adversely affect gross margins. gross margins could also be affected by the companys ability to manage product quality and warranty costs effectively and to stimulate demand for
certain of its products. due to the companys significant international operations, financial results can be significantly affected in the short-term by fluctuations in exchange rates.operating expensesoperating expenses for 2013, 2012 and 2011 are as

total r&d expense increased 32% and 39% in 2013 and 2012, respectively, it remained fairly consistent as a percentage of net sales. the company continues to believe that focused investments in r&d are critical to its future growth and
competitive position in the marketplace and are directly related to timely development of new and enhanced products that are central to the companys core business strategy. as such, the company expects to make further investments in r&d to
remain competitive.selling, general and administrative (sg&a) expensethe growth in sg&a during 2013 was primarily due to the companys continued expansion of its retail segment and increased

are as follows (in millions):interest and dividend incomeinterest expenseother expense, nettotal other income/(expense), netthe year-over-year increase in other income and expense during 2013 was due primarily to higher interest
and dividend income resulting from the companys higher cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balances and lower premium expenses on foreign exchange contracts, partially offset by interest expense on debt issued in the third quarter
of 2013 and remeasurement losses from foreign exchange rate movements. the overall increase in other income and expense in 2012 compared to 2011 was attributable to higher interest and dividend income on the companys higher cash, cash
equivalents and marketable securities balances, partially offset by higher premium expenses on foreign exchange contracts. the weighted average interest rate earned by the company on its cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities was 1.03%
during 2013 and 2012 and 0.77% during 2011. the company had no debt outstanding during 2012 and 2011 and accordingly did not incur any related interest expense.provision for income taxesprovision for income taxes and effective tax
rates for 2013, 2012 and 2011 are as follows (in millions):provision for income taxeseffective tax ratethe companys effective tax rates for all periods differ from the statutory federal income tax rate

outside the u.s.as of september 28, 2013, the company had deferred tax assets arising from deductible temporary
differences, tax losses, and tax credits of $4.2 billion, and deferred tax liabilities of $16.5 billion. management believes it is more likely than not that forecasted income, including income that may be generated as a result of certain tax
planning strategies, together with future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, will be sufficient to fully recover the deferred tax assets. the company will continue to evaluate the realizability of deferred tax assets quarterly by
assessing the need for and amount of a valuation allowance.the internal revenue service (the irs) has completed
its field audit of the companys federal income tax returns for the years 2004 through 2006 and proposed certain adjustments. the company has contested certain of these adjustments through the irs appeals office. the irs is currently examining
the years 2007 through 2012. all irs audit issues for years prior to 2004 have been resolved. in addition, the company is subject to audits by state, local, and foreign tax authorities. management believes that adequate provisions have been

dividends and the share repurchase program will come from its current domestic cash, cash generated from on-going u.s. operating activities and from borrowings.as of september 28, 2013 and september 29, 2012, $111.3 billion and $82.6 billion, respectively, of the companys cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities were held by foreign
subsidiaries and are generally based in u.s. dollar-denominated holdings. amounts held by foreign subsidiaries are generally subject to u.s. income taxation on repatriation to the u.s. the companys
marketable securities investment portfolio is invested primarily in highly-rated securities and its investment policy generally limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. the policy requires investments generally to be investment grade
with the objective of minimizing the potential risk of principal loss.during 2013, cash generated from operating activities
of $53.7 billion was a result of $37.0 billion of net income, non-cash adjustments to net income of $10.2 billion and an increase in net change in operating assets and liabilities of $6.5 billion. cash used in investing activities of $33.8 billion
during 2013 consisted primarily of net purchases, sales and maturities of marketable securities of $24.0 billion and cash used to acquire property, plant and equipment of $8.2 billion. cash used in financing activities during 2013 consisted
primarily of cash used to repurchase common stock of $22.9 billion and cash used to pay dividends and dividend equivalent rights of $10.6 billion, partially offset by net proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt of $16.9 billion.during 2012, cash generated from operating activities of $50.9 billion was a result of $41.7 billion of net income and non-cash

including information systems hardware, software and enhancements.during 2014, the company expects to open about 30 new
retail stores, with approximately two-thirds located outside of the u.s. during 2014, the company also expects to remodel approximately 20 of its existing stores.long-term debtin the third quarter of 2013, the company issued $17.0
billion of long-term debt, which included $3.0 billion of floating-rate notes. to manage the risk of adverse fluctuations in interest rates associated with the floating-rate notes, the company entered into interest rate swaps with an aggregate
notional amount of $3.0 billion, which, in effect, fixed the interest rate of the floating-rate notes. of the aggregate principal amount of $17.0 billion, $2.5 billion is due in 2016 and $14.5 billion is due in 2018 through 2043.dividend and stock repurchase programin the third quarter of 2013, the company raised its cash dividend by 15% to $3.05 per common share. the company expects to continue to pay quarterly dividends of $3.05 per common share each quarter,
subject to declaration by the board of directors.in 2012, the companys board of directors authorized a program to
repurchase up to $10 billion of the companys common stock. in april 2013, the companys board of directors increased the share repurchase program authorization from $10 billion to $60 billion, of which $23.0 billion had been utilized as
of september 28, 2013. the share repurchase program is expected to be completed by december 2015. the companys share repurchase program does not obligate it to acquire any specific number of shares. under the program, shares may be
repurchased in privately negotiated or open market transactions, including under plans complying with rule 10b5-1 of the exchange act.beginning in august 2012 through december 2015, the company anticipates it will utilize approximately $100 billion to pay dividends and dividend equivalent rights, repurchase shares, and remit withheld
taxes related to net share settlement of restricted stock units, of which $37.1 billion had been utilized through september 28, 2013. the following table presents the companys dividends, share repurchases and net share settlement activity

terms ranging from five to 20 years, the majority of which are for 10 years, and often contain multi-year renewal options. as of september 28, 2013, the companys total future minimum lease payments under noncancelable operating leases
were $4.7 billion, of which $3.5 billion related to leases for retail space.purchase commitments with outsourcing
partners and component suppliersthe company utilizes several outsourcing partners to manufacture sub-assemblies for the
companys products and to perform final assembly and testing of finished products. these outsourcing partners acquire components and build product based on demand information supplied by the company, which typically covers periods up to 150
days. the company also obtains individual components for its products from a wide variety of individual suppliers. consistent with industry practice, the company acquires components through a combination of purchase orders, supplier contracts, and
open orders based on projected demand information. where appropriate, the purchases are applied to inventory component prepayments that are outstanding with the respective supplier. as of september 28, 2013, the
company had outstanding off-balance sheet third-party manufacturing commitments and component purchase commitments of $18.6 billion.other obligationsin addition to the off-balance sheet commitments
mentioned above, the company had outstanding obligations of $1.3 billion as of september 28, 2013, that consisted mainly of commitments to acquire capital assets, including product tooling and manufacturing process equipment, and commitments
related to advertising, research and development, internet and telecommunications services and other obligations.the
companys other non-current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets consist primarily of deferred tax liabilities, gross unrecognized tax benefits and the related gross interest and penalties. as of september 28, 2013, the company
had non-current deferred tax liabilities of $16.5 billion. additionally, as of september 28, 2013, the company had gross unrecognized tax benefits of $2.7 billion and an additional $590 million for gross interest and penalties classified as
non-current liabilities. at this time, the company is unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments in individual years in connection with these tax liabilities; therefore, such amounts are not included in the above
contractual obligation table.indemnificationthe company generally does not indemnify end-users of its operating system and application software against legal claims that the software infringes third-party intellectual property rights. other
agreements entered into by37



the company sometimes include indemnification provisions under which the company could be subject to costs and/or damages in the event of an infringement claim against the company or an
indemnified third-party. however, the company has not been required to make any significant payments resulting from such an infringement claim asserted against it or an indemnified third-party. in the opinion of management, there was not at least a
reasonable possibility the company may have incurred a material loss with respect to indemnification of end-users of its operating system or application software for infringement of third-party intellectual property rights. the company did not
record a liability for infringement costs related to indemnification as of september 28, 2013 or september 29, 2012.the company has entered into indemnification agreements with its directors and executive officers. under these agreements, the company
has agreed to indemnify such individuals to the fullest extent permitted by law against liabilities that arise by reason of their status as directors or officers and to advance expenses incurred by such individuals in connection with related legal
proceedings. it is not possible to determine the maximum potential amount of payments the company could be required to make under these agreements due to the limited history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances
involved in each claim. however, the company maintains directors and officers liability insurance coverage to reduce its exposure to such obligations, and payments made under these agreements historically have not been material.critical accounting policies and estimatesthe preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles (gaap) and the companys discussion and analysis of its
financial condition and operating results require the companys management to make judgments, assumptions, and estimates that affect the amounts reported in its consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. note 1, summary of
significant accounting policies of the notes to consolidated financial statements in part ii, item 8 of this form 10-k describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the companys consolidated
financial statements. management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values
of assets and liabilities. actual results may differ from these estimates and such differences may be material.management
believes the companys critical accounting policies and estimates are those related to revenue recognition, valuation and impairment of marketable securities, inventory valuation and valuation of manufacturing-related assets and estimated
purchase commitment cancellation fees, warranty costs, income taxes, and legal and other contingencies. management considers these policies critical because they are both important to the portrayal of the companys financial condition and
operating results, and they require management to make judgments and estimates about inherently uncertain matters. the companys senior management has reviewed these critical accounting policies and related disclosures with the audit and
finance committee of the companys board of directors.revenue recognitionnet sales consist primarily of revenue from the sale of hardware, software, digital content and applications, peripherals, and service and
support contracts. the company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the sales price is fixed or determinable, and collection is probable. product is considered delivered to the customer once it
has been shipped and title and risk of loss have been transferred. for most of the companys product sales, these criteria are met at the time the product is shipped. for online sales to individuals, for some sales to education customers in the
u.s., and for certain other sales, the company defers revenue until the customer receives the product because the company retains a portion of the risk of loss on these sales during transit. the company recognizes revenue from the sale of hardware
products, software bundled with hardware that is essential to the functionality of the hardware, and third-party digital content sold on the itunes store in accordance with general revenue recognition accounting guidance. the38



company recognizes revenue in accordance with industry specific software accounting guidance for the following types of sales transactions: (i) standalone sales of software products,
(ii) sales of software upgrades and (iii) sales of software bundled with hardware not essential to the functionality of the hardware.for multi-element arrangements that include hardware products containing software essential to the hardware products functionality, undelivered software elements that relate to the hardware
products essential software, and/or undelivered non-software services, the company allocates revenue to all deliverables based on their relative selling prices. in such circumstances, the company uses a hierarchy to determine the selling price
to be used for allocating revenue to deliverables: (i) vendor-specific objective evidence of fair value (vsoe), (ii) third-party evidence of selling price (tpe) and (iii) best estimate of selling price
(esp). vsoe generally exists only when the company sells the deliverable separately and is the price actually charged by the company for that deliverable. esps reflect the companys best estimates of what the selling prices of
elements would be if they were sold regularly on a stand-alone basis.for sales of qualifying versions of ios devices, mac
and apple tv, the company has indicated it may from time to time provide future unspecified software upgrades and features free of charge to customers. the company also provides various non-software services to owners of qualifying versions of ios
devices and mac. because the company has neither vsoe nor tpe for the unspecified software upgrade rights or the non-software services, revenue is allocated to these rights and services based on the companys esps. revenue allocated to the
unspecified software upgrade rights and non-software services based on the companys esps is deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis over the estimated period the software upgrades and non-software services are expected to be provided
for each of these devices, which ranges from two to four years.the companys process for determining esps involves
managements judgment and considers multiple factors that may vary over time depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each deliverable. should future facts and circumstances change, the companys esps and the future
rate of related amortization for software upgrades and non-software services related to future sales of these devices could change. factors subject to change include the unspecified software upgrade rights offered, the estimated value of unspecified
software upgrade rights, the estimated or actual costs incurred to provide non-software services, and the estimated period software upgrades and non-software services are expected to be provided.the company records reductions to revenue for estimated commitments related to price protection and other customer incentive programs.
for transactions involving price protection, the company recognizes revenue net of the estimated amount to be refunded, provided the refund amount can be reasonably and reliably estimated and the other conditions for revenue recognition have been
met. the companys policy requires that, if refunds cannot be reliably estimated, revenue is not recognized until reliable estimates can be made or the price protection lapses. for the companys other customer incentive programs, the
estimated cost is recognized at the later of the date at which the company has sold the product or the date at which the program is offered. the company also records reductions to revenue for expected future product returns based on the
companys historical experience. future market conditions and product transitions may require the company to increase customer incentive programs that could result in reductions to future revenue. additionally, certain customer incentive
programs require management to estimate the number of customers who will actually redeem the incentive. managements estimates are based on historical experience and the specific terms and conditions of particular incentive programs. if a
greater than estimated proportion of customers redeems such incentives, the company would be required to record additional reductions to revenue, which would have an adverse impact on the companys results of operations.valuation and impairment of marketable securitiesthe companys investments in available-for-sale securities are reported at fair value. unrealized gains and losses related to changes in the fair value of securities are recognized in accumulated
other comprehensive income, net of tax, in the companys consolidated balance sheets. changes in the fair value of available-for-sale securities39



impact the companys net income only when such securities are sold or an other-than-temporary impairment is recognized. realized gains and losses on the sale of securities are determined by
specific identification of each securitys cost basis. the company regularly reviews its investment portfolio to determine if any security is other-than-temporarily impaired, which would require the company to record an impairment charge in the
period any such determination is made. in making this judgment, the company evaluates, among other things, the duration and extent to which the fair value of a security is less than its cost; the financial condition of the issuer and any changes
thereto; and the companys intent to sell, or whether it will more likely than not be required to sell, the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis. the companys assessment on whether a security is other-than-temporarily
impaired could change in the future due to new developments or changes in assumptions related to any particular security.inventory valuation and valuation of manufacturing-related assets and estimated purchase commitment cancellation feesthe company must order components for its products and build inventory in advance of product shipments and has invested in manufacturing
process equipment, including capital assets held at its suppliers facilities. in addition, the company has made prepayments to certain of its suppliers associated with long-term supply agreements to secure supply of inventory components. the
company records a write-down for inventories of components and products, including third-party products held for resale, which have become obsolete or are in excess of anticipated demand or net realizable value. the company performs a detailed
review of inventory that considers multiple factors including demand forecasts, product life cycle status, product development plans, current sales levels, and component cost trends. the company also reviews its manufacturing-related capital assets
and inventory prepayments for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. if the company determines that an asset is not recoverable, it records an impairment loss equal to the
amount by which the carrying value of such an asset exceeds its fair value.the industries in which the company competes are
subject to a rapid and unpredictable pace of product and component obsolescence and demand changes. in certain circumstances the company may be required to record additional write-downs of inventory, inventory prepayments and/or
manufacturing-related capital assets. these circumstances include future demand or market conditions for the companys products being less favorable than forecasted, unforeseen technological changes or changes to the companys product
development plans that negatively impact the utility of any of these assets, or significant deterioration in the financial condition of one or more of the companys suppliers that hold any of the companys manufacturing process equipment
or to whom the company has made an inventory prepayment. such write-downs would adversely affect the companys results of operations in the period when the write-downs were recorded.the company records accruals for estimated cancellation fees related to component orders that have been cancelled or are expected to be
cancelled. consistent with industry practice, the company acquires components through a combination of purchase orders, supplier contracts, and open orders in each case based on projected demand. where appropriate, the purchases are
applied to inventory component prepayments that are outstanding with the respective supplier. purchase commitments typically cover the companys forecasted component and manufacturing requirements for periods up to 150 days.
if there is an abrupt and substantial decline in demand for one or more of the companys products, if the companys product development plans change, or if there is an unanticipated change in technological requirements for any of the
companys products, then the company may be required to record additional accruals for cancellation fees that would adversely affect its results of operations in the period when the cancellation fees are identified and recorded.warranty coststhe company provides for the estimated cost of warranties at the time the related revenue is recognized based on historical and projected warranty claim rates, historical and projected cost-per-claim, and
knowledge of specific product failures that are outside of the companys typical experience. each quarter, the company reevaluates40



these estimates to assess the adequacy of its recorded warranty liabilities considering the size of the installed base of products subject to warranty protection and adjusts the amounts as
necessary. if actual product failure rates or repair costs differ from estimates, revisions to the estimated warranty liabilities would be required and could materially affect the companys results of operations.income taxesthe company records a tax provision for the anticipated tax consequences of the reported results of operations. the provision for income taxes is computed using the asset and liability method, under which
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards.
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in effect for the years in which those tax assets are expected to be realized or settled. the company records a valuation allowance
to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is believed more likely than not to be realized.the company recognizes tax
benefits from uncertain tax positions only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. the tax benefits recognized in the financial
statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement.management believes it is more likely than not that forecasted income, including income that may be generated as a result of certain tax planning strategies, together with future reversals of existing
taxable temporary differences, will be sufficient to fully recover the deferred tax assets. in the event that the company determines all or part of the net deferred tax assets are not realizable in the future, the company will make an adjustment to
the valuation allowance that would be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made. in addition, the calculation of tax liabilities involves significant judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of gaap
and complex tax laws. resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with managements expectations could have a material impact on the companys financial condition and operating results.legal and other contingenciesas discussed in part i, item 3 of this form 10-k under the heading legal proceedings and in part ii, item 8 of this form 10-k in the notes to consolidated financial statements in
note 10, commitments and contingencies, the company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business. the company records a liability when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and
the amount is reasonably estimable. there is significant judgment required in both the probability determination and as to whether an exposure can be reasonably estimated. in the opinion of management, there was not at least a reasonable possibility
the company may have incurred a material loss, or a material loss in excess of a recorded accrual, with respect to loss contingencies for legal and other contingencies. however, the outcome of legal proceedings and claims brought against the company
is subject to significant uncertainty. therefore, although management considers the likelihood of such an outcome to be remote, if one or more of these legal matters were resolved against the company in a reporting period for amounts in excess of
managements expectations, the companys consolidated financial statements for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected.41


## Item 7A


currency product pricing due to competitive pressures when there have been significant volatility in foreign currency exchange rates.the company may enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts with financial institutions to protect against foreign exchange
risks associated with certain existing assets and liabilities, certain firmly committed transactions, forecasted future cash flows, and net investments in foreign subsidiaries. the companys practice is to hedge a portion of its material
foreign exchange exposures, typically for up to 12 months. however, the company may choose not to hedge certain foreign exchange exposures for a variety of reasons, including but not limited to accounting considerations and the prohibitive economic
cost of hedging particular exposures.to provide a meaningful assessment of the foreign currency risk associated with certain
of the companys foreign currency derivative positions, the company performed a sensitivity analysis using a value-at-risk (var) model to assess the potential impact of fluctuations in exchange rates. the var model consisted of
using a monte carlo simulation to generate thousands of random market price paths assuming normal market conditions. the var is the maximum expected loss in fair value, for a given confidence interval, to the companys foreign currency
derivative positions due to adverse movements in rates. the var model is not intended to represent actual losses but is used as a risk estimation and management tool. the model assumes normal market conditions. forecasted transactions, firm
commitments, and assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies were excluded from the model. based on the results of the model, the company estimates with 95% confidence a maximum one-day loss in fair value of $201 million as of
september 28, 2013 compared to a maximum one-day loss in fair value of $200 million as of september 29, 2012. because the company uses foreign currency instruments for hedging purposes, the loss in fair value incurred on those instruments
are generally offset by increases in the fair value of the underlying exposures.actual future gains and losses associated
with the companys investment portfolio and derivative positions may differ materially from the sensitivity analyses performed as of september 28, 2013 due to the inherent limitations associated with predicting the timing and amount of
changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchanges rates and the companys actual exposures and positions.43

notes to consolidated financial statementsnote 1  summary of significant accounting policiesapple inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries (collectively apple or the company) designs,
manufactures, and markets mobile communication and media devices, personal computers, and portable digital music players, and sells a variety of related software, services, peripherals, networking solutions, and third-party digital content and
applications. the company sells its products worldwide through its retail stores, online stores, and direct sales force, as well as through third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers and value-added resellers. in addition, the
company sells a variety of third-party iphone, ipad, mac, and ipod compatible products, including application software, and various accessories through its online and retail stores. the company sells to consumers, small and mid-sized businesses, and
education, enterprise and government customers.basis of presentation and preparationthe accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the company. intercompany accounts and transactions have been
eliminated. the preparation of these consolidated financial statements in conformity with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles (gaap) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in
these consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. actual results could differ materially from those estimates. certain prior period amounts in the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto have been reclassified to conform to
the current periods presentation.the companys fiscal year is the 52 or 53-week period that ends on the last
saturday of september. the companys fiscal years 2013, 2012 and 2011 ended on september 28, 2013, september 29, 2012 and september 24, 2011, respectively. an additional week is included in the first fiscal quarter
approximately every six years to realign fiscal quarters with calendar quarters. fiscal year 2012 spanned 53 weeks, with a 14th week included in the first quarter of 2012. fiscal years 2013 and 2011 spanned 52 weeks each. unless otherwise stated,
references to particular years, quarters, months and periods refer to the companys fiscal years ended in september and the associated quarters, months and periods of those fiscal years.during the first quarter of 2013, the company adopted amended accounting standards that changed the presentation of comprehensive income.
these standards increased the prominence of other comprehensive income (oci) by eliminating the option to present components of oci as part of the statement of changes in shareholders equity and required the components of oci to be
presented either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two consecutive statements. the amended accounting standards only impacted the financial statement presentation of oci and did not change the components that are
recognized in net income or oci; accordingly, the adoption had no impact on the companys financial position or results of operations.revenue recognitionnet
sales consist primarily of revenue from the sale of hardware, software, digital content and applications, peripherals, and service and support contracts. the company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has
occurred, the sales price is fixed or determinable, and collection is probable. product is considered delivered to the customer once it has been shipped and title and risk of loss have been transferred. for most of the companys product sales,
these criteria are met at the time the product is shipped. for online sales to individuals, for some sales to education customers in the u.s., and for certain other sales, the company defers revenue until the customer receives the product because
the company retains a portion of the risk of loss on these sales during transit. the company recognizes revenue from the sale of hardware products, software bundled with hardware that is essential to the functionality of the hardware, and
third-party digital content sold on the itunes store in accordance with general revenue recognition accounting guidance. the company recognizes revenue in accordance with industry specific software accounting guidance for the50



following types of sales transactions: (i) standalone sales of software products, (ii) sales of software upgrades and (iii) sales of software bundled with hardware not essential to
the functionality of the hardware.for the sale of most third-party products, the company recognizes revenue based on the
gross amount billed to customers because the company establishes its own pricing for such products, retains related inventory risk for physical products, is the primary obligor to the customer and assumes the credit risk for amounts billed to its
customers. for third-party applications sold through the app store and mac app store and certain digital content sold through the itunes store, the company does not determine the selling price of the products and is not the primary obligor to the
customer. therefore, the company accounts for such sales on a net basis by recognizing in net sales only the commission it retains from each sale. the portion of the gross amount billed to customers that is remitted by the company to third-party app
developers and certain digital content owners is not reflected in the companys consolidated statements of operations.the company records deferred revenue when it receives payments in advance of the delivery of products or the performance of services.
this includes amounts that have been deferred for unspecified and specified software upgrade rights and non-software services that are attached to hardware and software products. the company sells gift cards redeemable at its retail and online
stores, and also sells gift cards redeemable on the itunes store for the purchase of digital content and software. the company records deferred revenue upon the sale of the card, which is relieved upon redemption of the card by the customer. revenue
from applecare service and support contracts is deferred and recognized over the service coverage periods. applecare service and support contracts typically include extended phone support, repair services, web-based support resources and diagnostic
tools offered under the companys standard limited warranty.the company records reductions to revenue for estimated
commitments related to price protection and other customer incentive programs. for transactions involving price protection, the company recognizes revenue net of the estimated amount to be refunded. for the companys other customer incentive
programs, the estimated cost of these programs is recognized at the later of the date at which the company has sold the product or the date at which the program is offered. the company also records reductions to revenue for expected future product
returns based on the companys historical experience. revenue is recorded net of taxes collected from customers that are remitted to governmental authorities, with the collected taxes recorded as current liabilities until remitted to the
relevant government authority.revenue recognition for arrangements with multiple deliverablesfor multi-element arrangements that include hardware products containing software essential to the hardware products functionality,
undelivered software elements that relate to the hardware products essential software, and undelivered non-software services, the company allocates revenue to all deliverables based on their relative selling prices. in such circumstances, the
company uses a hierarchy to determine the selling price to be used for allocating revenue to deliverables: (i) vendor-specific objective evidence of fair value (vsoe), (ii) third-party evidence of selling price
(tpe), and (iii) best estimate of selling price (esp). vsoe generally exists only when the company sells the deliverable separately and is the price actually charged by the company for that deliverable. esps reflect the
companys best estimates of what the selling prices of elements would be if they were sold regularly on a stand-alone basis. for multi-element arrangements accounted for in accordance with industry specific software accounting guidance, the
company allocates revenue to all deliverables based on the vsoe of each element, and if vsoe does not exist revenue is recognized when elements lacking vsoe are delivered.for sales of qualifying versions of iphone, ipad and ipod touch (ios devices), mac and apple tv, the company has indicated it may from time to time provide future unspecified software upgrades
and features to the essential software bundled with each of these hardware products free of charge to customers. essential software for ios devices includes ios and related applications and for mac includes os x and related applications. the company
also provides various non-software services to owners of qualifying versions of ios devices and mac.51



the company has identified up to three deliverables regularly included in arrangements involving the sale of these devices. the first deliverable is the hardware and software essential to the
functionality of the hardware device delivered at the time of sale. the second deliverable is the embedded right included with the purchase of ios devices, mac and apple tv to receive on a when-and-if-available basis, future unspecified software
upgrades and features relating to the products essential software. the third deliverable is the non-software services to be provided to qualifying versions of ios devices and mac. the company allocates revenue between these deliverables using
the relative selling price method. because the company has neither vsoe nor tpe for these deliverables, the allocation of revenue is based on the companys esps. revenue allocated to the delivered hardware and the related essential software is
recognized at the time of sale provided the other conditions for revenue recognition have been met. revenue allocated to the embedded unspecified software upgrade rights and the non-software services is deferred and recognized on a straight-line
basis over the estimated period the software upgrades and non-software services are expected to be provided for each of these devices, which ranges from two to four years. cost of sales related to delivered hardware and related essential software,
including estimated warranty costs, are recognized at the time of sale. costs incurred to provide non-software services are recognized as cost of sales as incurred, and engineering and sales and marketing costs are recognized as operating expenses
as incurred.the companys process for determining its esp for deliverables without vsoe or tpe considers multiple
factors that may vary depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each deliverable. the company believes its customers would be reluctant to buy unspecified software upgrade rights for the essential software included with its
qualifying hardware products. this view is primarily based on the fact that unspecified software upgrade rights do not obligate the company to provide upgrades at a particular time or at all, and do not specify to customers which upgrades or
features will be delivered. the company also believes its customers would be unwilling to pay a significant amount for access to the non-software services because other companies offer similar services at little or no cost to users. therefore, the
company has concluded that if it were to sell upgrade rights or access to the non-software services on a standalone basis, including those rights and services attached to ios devices, mac and apple tv, the selling prices would be relatively low. key
factors considered by the company in developing the esps for software upgrade rights include prices charged by the company for similar offerings, market trends in the pricing of apple-branded and third-party mac and ios compatible software, the
nature of the upgrade rights (e.g., unspecified versus specified), and the relative esp of the upgrade rights as compared to the total selling price of the product. the company may also consider additional factors as appropriate, including the
impact of other products and services provided to customers, the pricing of competitive alternatives if they exist, product-specific business objectives, and the length of time a particular version of a device has been available. when relevant, the
same factors are considered by the company in developing esps for offerings such as the non-software services with additional consideration given to the estimated cost to provide such services.in 2013, 2012 and 2011, the companys combined esps for the unspecified software upgrade rights and the rights to receive the
non-software services included with its qualifying hardware devices have ranged from $5 to $25. beginning in september 2013, the combined esps for iphone and ipad were increased by up to $5 to reflect additions to unspecified software upgrade rights
due to expansion of essential software bundled with these devices. accordingly, the range of combined esps for iphone and ipad as of september 2013 is $15 to $25. beginning in october 2013, the company anticipates increasing the combined esps for
mac from $20 to $40 to reflect additions to unspecified software upgrade rights related to expansion of bundled essential software. revenue allocated to such rights is deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis over the estimated period the
rights are expected to be provided for each device, which ranges from two to four years.shipping costsfor all periods presented, amounts billed to customers related to shipping and handling are classified as revenue, and the companys
shipping and handling costs are included in cost of sales.52



warranty expensethe company generally provides for the estimated cost of hardware and software warranties at the time the related revenue is recognized. the company assesses the adequacy of its pre-existing warranty
liabilities and adjusts the amounts as necessary based on actual experience and changes in future estimates.software development costsresearch and development costs are expensed as incurred. development costs of computer software to be sold, leased, or
otherwise marketed are subject to capitalization beginning when a products technological feasibility has been established and ending when a product is available for general release to customers. in most instances, the companys products
are released soon after technological feasibility has been established. costs incurred subsequent to achievement of technological feasibility were not significant, and software development costs were expensed as incurred during 2013, 2012 and 2011.advertising costsadvertising costs are expensed as incurred and included in selling, general and administrative expenses. advertising expense was $1.1 billion, $1.0 billion and $933 million for 2013, 2012 and 2011,
respectively.share-based compensationthe company recognizes expense related to share-based payment transactions in which it receives employee services in exchange for (a) equity instruments of the company or (b) liabilities that
are based on the fair value of the enterprises equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of such equity instruments. share-based compensation cost for restricted stock units (rsus) is measured based on the closing
fair market value of the companys common stock on the date of grant. share-based compensation cost for stock options and employee stock purchase plan rights (stock purchase rights) is measured at the grant date and offering date,
respectively, based on the fair-value as calculated by the black-scholes-merton (bsm) option-pricing model. the bsm option-pricing model incorporates various assumptions including expected volatility, estimated expected life and interest
rates. the company recognizes share-based compensation cost over the awards requisite service period on a straight-line basis for time-based rsus and on a graded basis for rsus that are contingent on the achievement of performance metrics. the
company recognizes a benefit from share-based compensation in the consolidated statements of shareholders equity if an incremental tax benefit is realized. in addition, the company recognizes the indirect effects of share-based compensation on
research and development tax credits, foreign tax credits and domestic manufacturing deductions in the consolidated statements of operations. further information regarding share-based compensation can be found in note 9, benefit plans of
this form 10-k.income taxesthe provision for income taxes is computed using the asset and liability method, under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary
differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to taxable
income in effect for the years in which those tax assets are expected to be realized or settled. the company records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is believed more likely than not to be realized.the company recognizes the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not the tax position will be
sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50%
likelihood of being realized upon settlement. see note 5, income taxes of this form 10-k for additional information.53

earnings per sharebasic earnings per share is computed by dividing income available to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. diluted earnings per share
is computed by dividing income available to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period increased to include the number of additional shares of common stock that would have been
outstanding if the potentially dilutive securities had been issued. potentially dilutive securities include outstanding stock options, shares to be purchased under the companys employee stock purchase plan and unvested rsus. the dilutive
effect of potentially dilutive securities is reflected in diluted earnings per share by application of the treasury stock method. under the treasury stock method, an increase in the fair market value of the companys common stock can result in
a greater dilutive effect from potentially dilutive securities.the following table shows the computation of basic and
diluted earnings per share for 2013, 2012, and 2011 (in thousands, except net income in millions and per share amounts):numerator:net incomedenominator:weighted-average shares outstandingeffect of dilutive securitiesweighted-average diluted sharesbasic earnings per sharediluted earnings per sharepotentially dilutive securities representing 4.2 million, 1.0 million and 1.7 million
shares of common stock for 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively, were excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share for these periods because their effect would have been antidilutive.financial instrumentscash equivalents and marketable securitiesall highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase are classified as cash equivalents. the companys marketable debt and equity securities have been
classified and accounted for as available-for-sale. management determines the appropriate classification of its investments at the time of purchase and reevaluates the
designations at each balance sheet date. the company classifies its marketable debt securities as either short-term or long-term based on each instruments underlying contractual maturity date. marketable debt securities with maturities of 12
months or less are classified as short-term and marketable debt securities with maturities greater than 12 months are classified as long-term. the company classifies its marketable equity securities, including mutual funds, as either short-term or
long-term based on the nature of each security and its availability for use in current operations. the companys marketable debt and equity securities are carried at fair value, with the unrealized gains and losses, net of taxes, reported as a
component of shareholders equity. the cost of securities sold is based upon the specific identification method.derivative financial instrumentsthe company accounts for its derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities and carries them at fair value.for derivative instruments that hedge the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows that are designated as cash flow hedges, the effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative
instrument is reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (aoci) in shareholders equity and reclassified into income in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. the
ineffective portion of the gain or54



loss on the derivative instrument, if any, is recognized in current income. to receive hedge accounting treatment, cash flow hedges must be highly effective in offsetting changes to expected
future cash flows on hedged transactions. for options designated as cash flow hedges, changes in the time value are excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and are recognized in income. for derivative instruments that hedge the exposure
to changes in the fair value of an asset or a liability and that are designated as fair value hedges, both the net gain or loss on the derivative instrument as well as the offsetting gain or loss on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk
are recognized in earnings in the current period. the company had no fair value hedges in 2013, 2012 and 2011. the net gain or loss on the effective portion of a derivative instrument that is designated as an economic hedge of the foreign currency
translation exposure of the net investment in a foreign operation is reported in the same manner as a foreign currency translation adjustment. for forward exchange contracts designated as net investment hedges, the company excludes changes in fair
value relating to changes in the forward carry component from its definition of effectiveness. accordingly, any gains or losses related to this component are recognized in current income. derivatives that do not qualify as hedges are adjusted to
fair value through current income.allowance for doubtful accountsthe company records its allowance for doubtful accounts based upon its assessment of various factors. the company considers historical
experience, the age of the accounts receivable balances, credit quality of the companys customers, current economic conditions, and other factors that may affect customers ability to pay.inventoriesinventories
are stated at the lower of cost, computed using the first-in, first-out method, or market. if the cost of the inventories exceeds their market value, provisions are made currently for the difference between the cost and the market value.property, plant and equipmentproperty, plant and equipment are stated at cost. depreciation is computed by use of the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which
for buildings is the lesser of 30 years or the remaining life of the underlying building; between two to five years for machinery and equipment, including product tooling and manufacturing process equipment; and the shorter of lease terms or ten
years for leasehold improvements. the company capitalizes eligible costs to acquire or develop internal-use software that are incurred subsequent to the preliminary project stage. capitalized costs related to internal-use software are amortized
using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which range from three to five years. depreciation and amortization expense on property and equipment was $5.8 billion, $2.6 billion and $1.6 billion during 2013, 2012 and
2011, respectively.long-lived assets including goodwill and other acquired intangible assetsthe company reviews property, plant and equipment, inventory component prepayments, and certain identifiable intangibles, excluding
goodwill, for impairment. long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. recoverability of these assets is measured by comparison of their
carrying amounts to future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate. if property, plant and equipment, inventory component prepayments, and certain identifiable intangibles are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be
recognized equals the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds its fair value. the company did not record any significant impairments during 2013, 2012 and 2011.the company does not amortize goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives, rather such assets are required to be tested
for impairment at least annually or sooner whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the assets may be impaired. the company performs its goodwill and intangible asset impairment tests in the fourth quarter of each year. the company
did not recognize any impairment charges related to55



goodwill or indefinite lived intangible assets during 2013, 2012 and 2011. the company established reporting units based on its current reporting structure. for purposes of testing goodwill for
impairment, goodwill has been allocated to these reporting units to the extent it relates to each reporting unit. in 2013 and 2012, the companys goodwill was allocated to the americas and europe reportable operating segments.the company amortizes its intangible assets with definite useful lives over their estimated useful lives and reviews these assets for
impairment. the company is currently amortizing its acquired intangible assets with definite useful lives over periods typically from three to seven years.fair value measurementsthe company applies fair value accounting for all
financial assets and liabilities and non-financial assets and liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis. the company defines fair value as the price that would be received from
selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. when determining the fair value measurements for assets and liabilities, which are required to be recorded at fair value,
the company considers the principal or most advantageous market in which the company would transact and the market-based risk measurements or assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, such as risks inherent in
valuation techniques, transfer restrictions and credit risk. fair value is estimated by applying the following hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value into three levels and bases the categorization within the hierarchy
upon the lowest level of input that is available and significant to the fair value measurement:level 1  quoted prices in active
markets for identical assets or liabilities.level 2  observable inputs other than quoted prices in active
markets for identical assets and liabilities, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in inactive markets, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of
the assets or liabilities.level 3  inputs that are generally unobservable and typically reflect
managements estimate of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability.the
companys valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of money market funds and certain marketable equity securities were derived from quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. the valuation techniques used to
measure the fair value of all other financial instruments, all of which have counterparties with high credit ratings, were valued based on quoted market prices or model driven valuations using significant inputs derived from or corroborated by
observable market data.in accordance with the fair value accounting requirements, companies may choose to measure eligible
financial instruments and certain other items at fair value. the company has not elected the fair value option for any eligible financial instruments.foreign currency translation and remeasurementthe company translates the
assets and liabilities of its non-u.s. dollar functional currency subsidiaries into u.s. dollars using exchange rates in effect at the end of each period. revenue and expenses for these subsidiaries are translated using rates that approximate those
in effect during the period. gains and losses from these translations are recognized in foreign currency translation included in aoci in shareholders equity. the companys subsidiaries that use the u.s. dollar as their functional currency
remeasure monetary assets and liabilities at exchange rates in effect at the end of each period, and inventories, property, and nonmonetary assets and liabilities at historical rates. gains and losses from these remeasurements were not significant
and have been included in the companys results of operations.56

september 29, 2012 are related primarily to long-term marketable securities. the company may sell certain of its marketable securities prior to their stated maturities for strategic reasons including, but not limited to, anticipation of credit
deterioration and duration management. during 2013, 2012 and 2011, the net realized gains recognized by the company were not significant. the maturities of the companys long-term marketable securities generally range from one to five years.57



as of september 28, 2013 and september 29, 2012, gross unrealized losses related
to individual securities that had been in a continuous loss position for 12 months or longer were not significant.as of
september 28, 2013, the company considered the declines in market value of its marketable securities investment portfolio to be temporary in nature and did not consider any of its investments other-than-temporarily impaired. the company
typically invests in highly-rated securities, and its investment policy generally limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. the policy requires investments generally to be investment grade, with the primary objective of minimizing the
potential risk of principal loss. fair values were determined for each individual security in the investment portfolio. when evaluating an investment for other-than-temporary impairment, the company reviews factors such as the length of time and
extent to which fair value has been below its cost basis, the financial condition of the issuer and any changes thereto, changes in market interest rates, and the companys intent to sell, or whether it is more likely than not it will be
required to sell, the investment before recovery of the investments cost basis. during 2013, 2012 and 2011 the company did not recognize any significant impairment charges.derivative financial instrumentsthe company uses derivatives to partially
offset its business exposure to foreign currency and interest rate risk. the company may enter into forward contracts, option contracts, swaps, or other derivative instruments to offset some of the risk on expected future cash flows, on net
investments in certain foreign subsidiaries, and on certain existing assets and liabilities.to help protect gross margins
from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, certain of the companys subsidiaries whose functional currency is the u.s. dollar hedge a portion of forecasted foreign currency revenue. the companys subsidiaries whose functional
currency is not the u.s. dollar and who sell in local currencies may hedge a portion of forecasted inventory purchases not denominated in the subsidiaries functional currencies. the company hedges a portion of its forecasted foreign currency
exposure associated with revenue and inventory purchases, typically for up to 12 months.to help protect the net investment
in a foreign operation from adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates, the company may enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts to offset the changes in the carrying amounts of these investments due to fluctuations in
foreign currency exchange rates.to help protect against adverse fluctuations in interest rates, the company may enter into
interest rate swaps, options, or other instruments to offset a portion of the changes in income or expense due to fluctuations in interest rates.the company may also enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts to partially offset the foreign currency exchange gains and losses generated by the re-measurement of certain assets and
liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies. however, the company may choose not to hedge certain foreign currency exchange exposures for a variety of reasons including, but not limited to, accounting considerations and the prohibitive
economic cost of hedging particular exposures. there can be no assurance the hedges will offset more than a portion of the financial impact resulting from movements in foreign currency exchange rates.the company records all derivatives in the consolidated balance sheets at fair value. the companys accounting treatment of these
instruments is based on whether the instruments are designated as hedge or non-hedge instruments. the effective portions of cash flow hedges are recorded in aoci until the hedged item is recognized in
earnings. the effective portions of net investment hedges are recorded in oci as a part of the cumulative translation adjustment. the ineffective portions of cash flow hedges and net investment hedges are recorded in other income and expense.
derivatives that are not designated as hedging instruments are adjusted to fair value through earnings in the financial statement line item to which the derivative relates.58

the company had net deferred losses of $175 million and $240 million associated with cash
flow hedges, net of taxes, recorded in aoci as of september 28, 2013 and september 29, 2012, respectively. deferred gains and losses associated with cash flow hedges of foreign currency revenue are recognized as a component of net sales in
the same period as the related revenue is recognized, and deferred gains and losses related to cash flow hedges of inventory purchases are recognized as a component of cost of sales in the same period as the related costs are recognized. deferred
gains and losses associated with cash flow hedges of interest income or expense are recognized as a component of other income/(expense), net in the same period as the related income or expense is recognized. the companys hedged foreign
currency transactions and hedged interest rate transactions as of september 28, 2013 are expected to occur within 12 months and five years, respectively.derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges must be de-designated as hedges when it is probable the forecasted hedged transaction will not occur in the initially identified time period or within
a subsequent two-month time period. deferred gains and losses in aoci associated with such derivative instruments are reclassified immediately into other income and expense. any subsequent changes in fair value of such derivative instruments are
reflected in other income and expense unless they are re-designated as hedges of other transactions. the company did not recognize any significant net gains or losses related to the loss of hedge designation on discontinued cash flow hedges during
2013, 2012 and 2011.the companys unrealized net gains and losses on net investment hedges, included in the cumulative
translation adjustment account of aoci, were not significant as of september 28, 2013 and september 29, 2012. the ineffective portions of and amounts excluded from the effectiveness test of net investment hedges are recorded in other
income and expense.the gain/loss recognized in other income and expense for foreign currency forward and option contracts
not designated as hedging instruments was not significant during 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. these amounts represent the net gain or loss on the derivative contracts and do not include changes in the related exposures, which generally offset
a portion of the gain or loss on the derivative contracts.the following table shows the notional principal amounts of the

transaction volume outstanding and do not represent the amount of the companys exposure to credit or market loss. the credit risk amounts represent the companys gross exposure to potential accounting loss on derivative instruments that
are outstanding or unsettled if all counterparties failed to perform according to the terms of the contract, based on then-current currency or interest rates at each respective date. the companys gross
exposure on these transactions may be further mitigated by collateral received from certain counterparties. the companys exposure to credit loss and market risk will vary over time as a function of currency and interest rates. although the
table above reflects the notional principal and credit risk amounts of the companys derivative instruments, it does not reflect the gains or losses associated with the exposures and transactions that the instruments are intended to hedge. the
amounts ultimately realized upon settlement of these financial instruments, together with the gains and losses on the underlying exposures, will depend on actual market conditions during the remaining life of the instruments.59

the company generally enters into master netting arrangements, which are designed to reduce
credit risk by permitting net settlement of transactions with the same counterparty. to further limit credit risk, the company generally enters into collateral security arrangements that provide for collateral to be received or posted when the net
fair value of certain financial instruments fluctuates from contractually established thresholds. the company presents its derivative assets and derivative liabilities at their gross fair values. as of september 28, 2013 and september 29,
2012, the company posted $164 million and $278 million, respectively, of cash collateral related to the derivative instruments under its collateral security arrangements, which were recorded as other current assets in the consolidated balance

value-added resellers, small and mid-sized businesses, and education, enterprise and government customers. the company generally does not require collateral from its customers; however, the company will require collateral in certain instances to
limit credit risk. in addition, when possible, the company attempts to limit credit risk on trade receivables with credit insurance for certain customers or by requiring third-party financing, loans or leases to support credit exposure. these
credit-financing arrangements are directly between the third-party financing company and the end customer. as such, the company generally does not assume any recourse or credit risk sharing related to any of these arrangements.as of september 28, 2013, the company had two customers that represented 10% or more of total trade receivables, one of which
accounted for 13% and the other 10%. as of september 29, 2012, the company had two customers that represented 10% or more of total trade receivables, one of which accounted for 14% and the other 10%. the companys cellular network carriers
accounted for 68% and 66% of trade receivables as of september 28, 2013 and september 29, 2012, respectively. the additions and write-offs to the companys allowance for doubtful accounts during 2013, 2012 and 2011 were not

2013 and vendor non-trade receivables from three of the companys vendors accounted for 45%, 21% and 12% of total non-trade receivables as of september 29, 2012. the company does not reflect the sale of these components in net sales and
does not recognize any profits on these sales until the related products are sold by the company, at which time any profit is recognized as a reduction of cost of sales.61

effects of temporary differences between the consolidated financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and are measured using enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in the years in
which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.uncertain tax positionstax positions are evaluated in a two-step process. the company first determines whether it is more likely than not that a tax position
will be sustained upon examination. if a tax position meets the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold it is then measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements. the tax position is measured as the largest
amount of benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. the company classifies gross interest and penalties and unrecognized tax benefits that are not expected to result in payment or receipt of cash within one
year as non-current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets.as of september 28, 2013, the total amount of gross
unrecognized tax benefits was $2.7 billion, of which $1.4 billion, if recognized, would affect the companys effective tax rate. as of september 29, 2012, the total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits was $2.1 billion, of which $889

balance sheets. in connection with tax matters, the company recognized interest and penalty expense in 2013, 2012 and 2011 of $189 million, $140 million and $14 million, respectively.the company is subject to taxation and files income tax returns in the u.s. federal jurisdiction and in many state and foreign
jurisdictions. for u.s. federal income tax purposes, all years prior to 2004 are closed. the internal revenue service (the irs) has completed its field audit of the companys federal income tax returns for the years 2004 through
2006 and proposed certain adjustments. the company has contested certain of these adjustments through the irs appeals office. the irs is currently examining the years 2007 through 2012. in addition, the company is also subject to audits by state,
local and foreign tax authorities. in major states and major foreign jurisdictions, the years subsequent to 1989 and 2002, respectively, generally remain open and could be subject to examination by the taxing authorities.management believes that an adequate provision has been made for any adjustments that may result from tax examinations. however, the
outcome of tax audits cannot be predicted with certainty. if any issues addressed in the companys tax audits are resolved in a manner not consistent with managements expectations, the company could be required to adjust its provision for
income tax in the period such resolution occurs. although timing of the resolution and/or closure of audits is not certain, the company believes it is reasonably possible that tax audit resolutions could reduce its unrecognized tax benefits by
between $125 million and $225 million in the next 12 months.note 6  long-term debtin may 2013, the company issued floating- and fixed-rate notes with varying maturities for an aggregate principal
amount of $17.0 billion (collectively the notes). the notes are senior unsecured obligations, and interest is payable in arrears, quarterly for the floating-rate notes and semi-annually for the fixed-rate notes.the principal amounts and associated interest rates of the notes as of september 28, 2013, are as follows:floating-rate notes, due 2016floating-rate notes, due 2018fixed-rate 0.45% notes due 2016fixed-rate 1.00% notes due 2018fixed-rate 2.40% notes due 2023fixed-rate 3.85% notes due 2043total66

the floating-rate notes due 2016 and 2018 bear interest at the three-month london interbank
offered rate (libor) plus 0.05% and 0.25%, respectively. to manage the risk of fluctuations in interest rates associated with the floating-rate notes, the company entered into interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional amount of $3.0
billion designated as cash flow hedges of its floating-rate notes. these hedges effectively convert the floating interest rate on the floating-rate notes to a fixed interest rate. the gains and losses related to changes in the fair value of the
interest rate swaps are recorded in oci with a portion reclassified to interest expense each period to offset changes in interest rates on the floating-rate notes. the effective rates for the notes include the interest on the notes, amortization of
the discount and, if applicable, adjustments related to hedging. the company recognized $136 million of interest expense for the year ended september 28, 2013. as of september 28, 2013, the aggregate unamortized discount for the

4.1 million shares were delivered under the asr at an average repurchase price of $478.20 per share. the shares were retired in the quarters they were delivered, and the up-front payment of $1.95 billion was accounted for as a reduction to
shareholders equity in the companys consolidated balance sheet in the first quarter of 2013.in april 2013, the
company entered into a new asr program with two financial institutions to purchase up to $12 billion of the companys common stock. in exchange for up-front payments totaling $12 billion, the financial institutions committed to deliver shares
during the asrs purchase periods, which will end during 2014. the total number of shares ultimately delivered, and therefore the average price paid per share, will be determined at the end of the applicable purchase period based on the volume
weighted average price of the companys stock during that period. during the third quarter of 2013, 23.5 million shares were initially delivered to the company and retired. this does not represent the final number of shares to be delivered
under the asr. the up-front payments of $12 billion were accounted for as a reduction to shareholders equity in the companys consolidated balance sheet.the company reflected the asrs as a repurchase of common stock for purposes of calculating earnings per share and as forward contracts indexed to its own common stock. the forward contracts met all of the
applicable criteria for equity classification, and, therefore, were not accounted for as derivative instruments.during 2013,
the company repurchased 19.4 million shares of its common stock in the open market at an average price of $464.11 per share for a total of $9.0 billion. these shares were retired upon repurchase.note 8  comprehensive incomecomprehensive income consists of two components, net income and other comprehensive income. other comprehensive income
refers to revenue, expenses, and gains and losses that under gaap are recorded as an element of shareholders equity but are excluded from net income. the companys other comprehensive income consists of foreign currency translation
adjustments from those subsidiaries not using the u.s. dollar as their functional currency, net deferred gains and losses on certain derivative instruments accounted for as cash flow hedges, and unrealized gains and losses on marketable securities
classified as available-for-sale.the following table shows the components of aoci, net of taxes, as of september 28,

note 9  benefit plansstock plans2003 employee stock planthe 2003 employee stock plan (the 2003
plan) is a shareholder approved plan that provides for broad-based equity grants to employees, including executive officers. the 2003 plan permits the granting of incentive stock options, nonstatutory stock options, rsus, stock appreciation
rights, stock purchase rights and performance-based awards. options granted under the 2003 plan generally expire seven to ten years after the grant date and generally become exercisable over a period of four years, based on continued employment,
with either annual, semi-annual or quarterly vesting. rsus granted under the 2003 plan generally vest over two to four years, based on continued employment and are settled upon vesting in shares of the companys common stock on a one-for-one
basis. each share issued with respect to an award granted under the 2003 plan (other than a stock option or stock appreciation right) reduces the number of shares available for grant under the plan by two shares, whereas shares issued in respect of
an option or stock appreciation right count against the number of shares available for grant on a one-for-one basis. all rsus, other than rsus held by the chief executive officer, granted under the 2003 plan have dividend equivalent rights
(der), which entitle holders of rsus to the same dividend value per share as holders of common stock. der are subject to the same vesting and other terms and conditions as the corresponding unvested rsus. der are accumulated and paid
when the underlying shares vest. as of september 28, 2013, approximately 28.3 million shares were reserved for future issuance under the 2003 plan.1997 director stock planthe 1997 director stock plan (the director
plan) is a shareholder approved plan that (i) permits the company to grant awards of rsus or stock options to the companys non-employee directors, (ii) provides for automatic initial grants of rsus upon a non-employee director
joining the board of directors and automatic annual grants of rsus at each annual meeting of shareholders, and (iii) permits the board of directors to prospectively change the relative mixture of stock options and rsus for the initial and
annual award grants and the methodology for determining the number of shares of the companys common stock subject to these grants without shareholder approval. each share issued with respect to rsus granted under the director plan reduces the
number of shares available for grant under the plan by two shares. the director plan expires november 9, 2019. all rsus granted under the director plan are entitled to der. as of september 28, 2013, approximately 176,000 shares were
reserved for future issuance under the director plan.rule 10b5-1 trading plansduring the fourth quarter of 2013, executive officers timothy d. cook, peter oppenheimer, d. bruce sewell, philip w. schiller, daniel
riccio and jeffrey e. williams and director william v. campbell had equity trading plans in place in accordance with rule 10b5-1(c)(1) under the exchange act. an equity trading plan is a written document that pre-establishes the amounts, prices and
dates (or formula for determining the amounts, prices and dates) of future purchases or sales of the companys stock, including shares acquired pursuant to the companys employee and director equity plans.employee stock purchase planthe employee stock purchase plan (the purchase plan) is a shareholder approved plan under which substantially all employees may purchase the companys common stock through payroll
deductions at a price equal to 85% of the lower of the fair market values of the stock as of the beginning or the end of six-month offering periods. an employees payroll deductions under the purchase plan are limited to 10% of the
employees compensation and employees may not purchase more than $25,000 of stock during any calendar year. as of september 28, 2013, approximately 1.8 million shares were reserved for future issuance under the purchase plan.69

401(k) planthe companys 401(k) plan (the 401(k) plan) is a deferred salary arrangement under section 401(k) of the internal revenue code. under the 401(k) plan, participating u.s. employees
may defer a portion of their pre-tax earnings, up to the irs annual contribution limit ($17,500 for calendar year 2013). the company matches 50% to 100% of each employees contributions, depending on length of service, up to a maximum 6% of the
employees eligible earnings. the companys matching contributions to the 401(k) plan were $135 million, $114 million and $90 million in 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively.restricted stock unitsa summary of the companys rsu activity and

for 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. the majority of rsus that vested in 2013, 2012 and 2011 were net-share settled such that the company withheld shares with value equivalent to the employees minimum statutory obligation for the applicable
income and other employment taxes, and remitted the cash to the appropriate taxing authorities. the total shares withheld were approximately 2.2 million, 2.3 million and 1.6 million for 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively, and were
based on the value of the rsus on their respective vesting dates as determined by the companys closing stock price. total payments for the employees tax obligations to taxing authorities were $1.1 billion, $1.2 billion and $520 million
in 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively, and are reflected as a financing activity within the consolidated statements of cash flows. these net-share settlements had the effect of share repurchases by the company as they reduced and retired the
number of shares that would have otherwise been issued as a result of the vesting and did not represent an expense to the company.70

company also offers a 90-day basic warranty for its service parts used to repair the companys hardware products. the company provides currently for the estimated cost that may be incurred under its basic
limited product warranties at the time related revenue is recognized. factors considered in determining appropriate accruals for product warranty obligations include the size of the installed base of products subject to warranty protection,
historical and projected warranty claim rates, historical and projected cost-per-claim, and knowledge of specific product failures that are outside of the companys typical experience. the company assesses the adequacy of its pre-existing
warranty liabilities and adjusts the amounts as necessary based on actual experience and changes in future estimates.the
following table shows changes in the companys accrued warranties and related costs for 2013, 2012 and 2011 (in millions):beginning accrued warranty and related costscost of warranty claimsaccruals for product warrantyending accrued warranty and related coststhe company generally does not indemnify end-users of its operating system and application software
against legal claims that the software infringes third-party intellectual property rights. other agreements entered into by the company sometimes include indemnification provisions under which the company could be subject to costs and/or damages in
the event of an infringement claim against the company or an indemnified third-party. however, the company has not been required to make any significant payments resulting from such an infringement claim asserted against it or an indemnified
third-party and, in the opinion of management, does not have a potential liability related to unresolved infringement claims subject to indemnification that would materially adversely affect its financial condition or operating results. therefore,
the company did not record a liability for infringement costs related to indemnification as of either september 28, 2013 or september 29, 2012.the company has entered into indemnification agreements with its directors and executive officers. under these agreements, the company has agreed to indemnify such individuals to the fullest extent
permitted by law against liabilities that arise by reason of their status as directors or officers and to advance expenses incurred by such72



individuals in connection with related legal proceedings. it is not possible to determine the maximum potential amount of payments the company could be required to make under these agreements due
to the limited history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each claim. however, the company maintains directors and officers liability insurance coverage to reduce its exposure to such obligations, and
payments made under these agreements historically have not been material.concentrations in the available sources of supply of materials
and productalthough most components essential to the companys business are generally available from multiple
sources, a number of components are currently obtained from single or limited sources. in addition, the company competes for various components with other participants in the markets for mobile communication and media devices and personal computers.
therefore, many components used by the company, including those that are available from multiple sources, are at times subject to industry-wide shortage and significant pricing fluctuations that can materially adversely affect the companys
financial condition and operating results.the company uses some custom components that are not commonly used by its
competitors, and new products introduced by the company often utilize custom components available from only one source. when a component or product uses new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers yields have
matured or manufacturing capacity has increased. if the companys supply of components for a new or existing product were delayed or constrained, or if an outsourcing partner delayed shipments of completed products to the company, the
companys financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected. the companys business and financial performance could also be materially adversely affected depending on the time required to obtain sufficient
quantities from the original source, or to identify and obtain sufficient quantities from an alternative source. continued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at all, may be affected if those suppliers concentrated on the
production of common components instead of components customized to meet the companys requirements.the company has
entered into various agreements for the supply of components; however, there can be no guarantee that the company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms, or at all. therefore, the company remains subject to significant
risks of supply shortages and price increases that can materially adversely affect its financial condition and operating results.substantially all of the companys hardware products are manufactured by outsourcing partners that are located primarily in asia. a significant concentration of this manufacturing is currently
performed by a small number of outsourcing partners, often in single locations. certain of these outsourcing partners are the sole-sourced suppliers of components and manufacturers for many of the companys products. although the company works
closely with its outsourcing partners on manufacturing schedules, the companys operating results could be adversely affected if its outsourcing partners were unable to meet their production commitments. the companys purchase commitments
typically cover its requirements for periods up to 150 days.other off-balance sheet commitmentslease commitmentsthe
company leases various equipment and facilities, including retail space, under noncancelable operating lease arrangements. the company does not currently utilize any other off-balance sheet financing arrangements. the major facility leases are
typically for terms not exceeding 10 years and generally provide renewal options for terms not exceeding five additional years. leases for retail space are for terms ranging from five to 20 years, the majority of which are for 10 years, and often
contain multi-year renewal options. as of september 28, 2013, the companys total future minimum lease payments under noncancelable operating leases were $4.7 billion, of which $3.5 billion related to leases for retail space.73

september 28, 2013, which consisted mainly of commitments to acquire capital assets, including product tooling and manufacturing process equipment, and commitments related to advertising, research and development, internet and
telecommunications services and other obligations.contingenciesthe company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that have arisen in the ordinary course of business and that have not been
fully adjudicated. in the opinion of management, there was not at least a reasonable possibility the company may have incurred a material loss, or a material loss in excess of a recorded accrual, with respect to loss contingencies. however, the
outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain. therefore, although management considers the likelihood of such an outcome to be remote, if one or more of these legal matters were resolved against the company in a reporting period for amounts in
excess of managements expectations, the companys consolidated financial statements for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected.apple inc. v. samsung electronics co., ltd, et al.on august 24,
2012, a jury returned a verdict awarding the company $1.05 billion in its lawsuit against samsung electronics co., ltd and affiliated parties in the united states district court, northern district of california, san jose division. on march 1,
2013, the district court upheld $599 million of the jurys award and ordered a new trial as to the remainder. because the award is subject to entry of final judgment, partial re-trial and appeal, the company has not recognized the award in
its results of operations.virnetx, inc. v. apple inc. et al.on august 11, 2010, virnetx, inc. filed an action against the company alleging that certain of its products infringed on four patents
relating to network communications technology. on november 6, 2012, a jury returned a verdict against the company, and awarded damages of $368 million. the company is challenging the verdict, believes it has valid defenses and has not recorded
a loss accrual at this time.74



note 11  segment information and geographic datathe company reports segment information based on the management approach. the management approach
designates the internal reporting used by management for making decisions and assessing performance as the source of the companys reportable segments.the company manages its business primarily on a geographic basis. the companys reportable operating segments consist of the americas, europe, greater china, japan, rest of asia pacific and retail
operations. the americas segment includes both north and south america. the europe segment includes european countries, as well as india, the middle east and africa. the greater china segment includes china, hong kong and taiwan. the rest of asia
pacific segment includes australia and asian countries, other than those countries included in the companys other operating segments. the retail segment operates apple retail stores in 13 countries, including the u.s. the results of the
companys geographic segments do not include results of the retail segment. each operating segment provides similar hardware and software products and similar services. the accounting policies of the various segments are the same as those
described in note 1, summary of significant accounting policies.the company evaluates the performance of its
operating segments based on net sales and operating income. net sales for geographic segments are generally based on the location of customers, while retail segment net sales are based on sales through the companys retail stores. operating
income for each segment includes net sales to third parties, related cost of sales and operating expenses directly attributable to the segment. advertising expenses are generally included in the geographic segment in which the expenditures are
incurred. operating income for each segment excludes other income and expense and certain expenses managed outside the operating segments. costs excluded from segment operating income include various corporate expenses such as research and
development, corporate marketing expenses, share-based compensation expense, income taxes, various nonrecurring charges, and other separately managed general and administrative costs and certain manufacturing period expenses. the company does not
include intercompany transfers between segments for management reporting purposes.segment assets include receivables and
inventories, and for the retail segment also includes capital assets. segment assets exclude corporate assets, such as cash and cash equivalents, short-term and long-term marketable securities, vendor non-trade receivables, other long-term
investments, manufacturing and corporate facilities, product tooling and manufacturing process equipment, miscellaneous corporate infrastructure, goodwill and other acquired intangible assets. except for the retail segment, capital asset purchases
for long-lived assets are not reported to management by segment and therefore are excluded from the geographic segment assets and instead included in corporate assets. cash payments for capital asset purchases by the retail segment were $495
million, $858 million and $612 million for 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. the companys total depreciation and amortization was $6.8 billion, $3.3 billion and $1.8 billion in 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively, of which $382 million, $319
million and $273 million was related to the retail segment in the respective years. depreciation and amortization on segment assets included in the geographic segments was not significant.75

# 2016 AAPL

## Item 1A


The Company markets certain mobile communication and media devices based on the iOS mobile operating system and also markets related services, including third-party digital content and applications. The Company faces substantial competition in these markets from companies that have significant technical, marketing, distribution and other resources, as well as established hardware, software and digital content supplier relationships; and the Company has a minority market share in the global smartphone market. Additionally, the Company faces significant price competition as competitors reduce their selling prices and attempt to imitate the Company’s product features and applications within their own products or, alternatively, collaborate with each other to offer solutions that are more competitive than those they currently offer. The Company competes with business models that provide content to users for free. The Company also competes with illegitimate means to obtain third-party digital content and applications. Some of the Company’s competitors have greater experience, product breadth and distribution channels than the Company. Because some current and potential competitors have substantial resources and/or experience and a lower cost structure, they may be able to provide products and services at little or no profit or even at a loss. The Company also expects competition to intensify as competitors attempt to imitate the Company’s approach to providing components seamlessly within their individual offerings or work collaboratively to offer integrated solutions. The Company’s financial condition and operating results depend substantially on the Company’s ability to continually improve iOS and iOS devices in order to maintain their functional and design advantages.The Company is the only authorized maker of hardware using macOS, which has a minority market share in the personal computer market. This market has been contracting and is dominated by computer makers using competing operating systems, most notably Windows. In the market for personal computers and accessories, the Company faces a significant number of competitors, many of which have broader product lines, lower priced products and a larger installed customer base. Historically, consolidation in this market has resulted in larger competitors. Price competition has been particularly intense as competitors have aggressively cut prices and lowered product margins. An increasing number of internet-enabled devices that include software applications and are smaller and simpler than traditional personal computers compete for market share with the Company’s existing products. The Company’s financial condition and operating results also depend on its ability to continually improve the Mac platform to maintain its functional and design advantages.There can be no assurance the Company will be able to continue to provide products and services that compete effectively. To remain competitive and stimulate customer demand, the Company must successfully manage frequent product introductions and transitions.Due to the highly volatile and competitive nature of the industries in which the Company competes, the Company must continually introduce new products, services and technologies, enhance existing products and services, effectively stimulate customer demand for new and upgraded products and successfully manage the transition to these new and upgraded products. The success of new product introductions depends on a number of factors including, but not limited to, timely and successful product development, market acceptance, the Company’s ability to manage the risks associated with new product production ramp-up issues, the availability of application software for new products, the effective management of purchase commitments and inventory levels in line with anticipated product demand, the availability of products in appropriate quantities and at expected costs to meet anticipated demand and the risk that new products may have quality or other defects or deficiencies in the early stages of introduction. Accordingly, the Company cannot determine in advance the ultimate effect of new product introductions and transitions. The Company depends on the performance of distributors, carriers and other resellers.The Company distributes its products through cellular network carriers, wholesalers, national and regional retailers and value-added resellers, many of whom distribute products from competing manufacturers. The Company also sells its products and third-party products in most of its major markets directly to education, enterprise and government customers and consumers and small and mid-sized businesses through its online and retail stores. Some carriers providing cellular network service for iPhone subsidize users’ purchases of the device. There is no assurance that such subsidies will be continued at all or in the same amounts upon renewal of the Company’s agreements with these carriers or in agreements the Company enters into with new carriers. Many resellers have been adversely affected in the past by weak economic conditions. The Company has invested and will continue to invest in programs to enhance reseller sales, including staffing selected resellers’ stores with Company employees and contractors, and improving product placement displays. These programs could require a substantial investment while providing no assurance of return or incremental revenue. The financial condition of these resellers could weaken, these resellers could stop distributing the Company’s products, or uncertainty regarding demand for some or all of the Company’s products could cause resellers to reduce their ordering and marketing of the Company’s products.

The Company faces substantial inventory and other asset risk in addition to purchase commitment cancellation risk.The Company records a write-down for product and component inventories that have become obsolete or exceed anticipated demand or net realizable value and accrues necessary cancellation fee reserves for orders of excess products and components. The Company also reviews its long-lived assets, including capital assets held at its suppliers’ facilities and inventory prepayments, for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. If the Company determines that impairment has occurred, it records a write-down equal to the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds its fair value. Although the Company believes its provisions related to inventory, capital assets, inventory prepayments and other assets and purchase commitments are currently adequate, no assurance can be given that the Company will not incur additional related charges given the rapid and unpredictable pace of product obsolescence in the industries in which the Company competes. The Company must order components for its products and build inventory in advance of product announcements and shipments. Consistent with industry practice, components are normally acquired through a combination of purchase orders, supplier contracts and open orders, in each case based on projected demand. Manufacturing purchase obligations typically cover forecasted component and manufacturing requirements for periods up to 150 days. Because the Company’s markets are volatile, competitive and subject to rapid technology and price changes, there is a risk the Company will forecast incorrectly and order or produce excess or insufficient amounts of components or products, or not fully utilize firm purchase commitments. Future operating results depend upon the Company’s ability to obtain components in sufficient quantities on commercially reasonable terms.Because the Company currently obtains components from single or limited sources, the Company is subject to significant supply and pricing risks. Many components, including those that are available from multiple sources, are at times subject to industry-wide shortages and significant commodity pricing fluctuations. While the Company has entered into agreements for the supply of many components, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms, or at all. A number of suppliers of components may suffer from poor financial conditions, which can lead to business failure for the supplier or consolidation within a particular industry, further limiting the Company’s ability to obtain sufficient quantities of components on commercially reasonable terms. The effects of global or regional economic conditions on the Company’s suppliers, described in “Global and regional economic conditions could materially adversely affect the Company” above, also could affect the Company’s ability to obtain components. Therefore, the Company remains subject to significant risks of supply shortages and price increases. The Company’s new products often utilize custom components available from only one source. When a component or product uses new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers’ yields have matured or manufacturing capacity has increased. Continued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at all, may be affected for any number of reasons, including if those suppliers decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the Company’s requirements. The supply of components for a new or existing product could be delayed or constrained, or a key manufacturing vendor could delay shipments of completed products to the Company. The Company depends on component and product manufacturing and logistical services provided by outsourcing partners, many of which are located outside of the U.S.Substantially all of the Company’s manufacturing is performed in whole or in part by a few outsourcing partners located primarily in Asia. The Company has also outsourced much of its transportation and logistics management. While these arrangements may lower operating costs, they also reduce the Company’s direct control over production and distribution. It is uncertain what effect such diminished control will have on the quality or quantity of products or services, or the Company’s flexibility to respond to changing conditions. Although arrangements with these partners may contain provisions for warranty expense reimbursement, the Company may remain responsible to the consumer for warranty service in the event of product defects and could experience an unanticipated product defect or warranty liability. While the Company relies on its partners to adhere to its supplier code of conduct, material violations of the supplier code of conduct could occur.  The Company relies on sole-sourced outsourcing partners in the U.S., Asia and Europe to supply and manufacture many critical components, and on outsourcing partners primarily located in Asia, for final assembly of substantially all of the Company’s hardware products. Any failure of these partners to perform may have a negative impact on the Company’s cost or supply of components or finished goods. In addition, manufacturing or logistics in these locations or transit to final destinations may be disrupted for a variety of reasons including, but not limited to, natural and man-made disasters, information technology system failures, commercial disputes, military actions or economic, business, labor, environmental, public health, or political issues. The Company has invested in manufacturing process equipment, much of which is held at certain of its outsourcing partners, and has made prepayments to certain of its suppliers associated with long-term supply agreements. While these arrangements help ensure the supply of components and finished goods, if these outsourcing partners or suppliers experience severe financial problems or other disruptions in their business, such continued supply could be reduced or terminated and the net realizable value of these assets could be negatively impacted.Apple Inc. | 2016 Form 10-K | 10



The Company’s products and services may experience quality problems from time to time that can result in decreased sales and operating margin and harm to the Company’s reputation.The Company sells complex hardware and software products and services that can contain design and manufacturing defects. Sophisticated operating system software and applications, such as those sold by the Company, often contain “bugs” that can unexpectedly interfere with the software’s intended operation. The Company’s online services may from time to time experience outages, service slowdowns, or errors. Defects may also occur in components and products the Company purchases from third parties. There can be no assurance the Company will be able to detect and fix all defects in the hardware, software and services it sells. Failure to do so could result in lost revenue, significant warranty and other expenses and harm to the Company’s reputation. The Company relies on access to third-party digital content, which may not be available to the Company on commercially reasonable terms or at all.The Company contracts with numerous third parties to offer their digital content to customers. This includes the right to sell currently available music, movies, TV shows and books. The licensing or other distribution arrangements with these third parties are for relatively short terms and do not guarantee the continuation or renewal of these arrangements on reasonable terms, if at all. Some third-party content providers and distributors currently or in the future may offer competing products and services, and could take action to make it more difficult or impossible for the Company to license or otherwise distribute their content in the future. Other content owners, providers or distributors may seek to limit the Company’s access to, or increase the cost of, such content. The Company may be unable to continue to offer a wide variety of content at reasonable prices with acceptable usage rules, or continue to expand its geographic reach. Failure to obtain the right to make available third-party digital content, or to make available such content on commercially reasonable terms, could have a material adverse impact on the Company’s financial condition and operating results. Some third-party digital content providers require the Company to provide digital rights management and other security solutions. If requirements change, the Company may have to develop or license new technology to provide these solutions. There is no assurance the Company will be able to develop or license such solutions at a reasonable cost and in a timely manner. In addition, certain countries have passed or may propose and adopt legislation that would force the Company to license its digital rights management, which could lessen the protection of content and subject it to piracy and also could negatively affect arrangements with the Company’s content providers.The Company’s future performance depends in part on support from third-party software developers.The Company believes decisions by customers to purchase its hardware products depend in part on the availability of third‑party software applications and services. There is no assurance that third-party developers will continue to develop and maintain software applications and services for the Company’s products. If third-party software applications and services cease to be developed and maintained for the Company’s products, customers may choose not to buy the Company’s products. With respect to its Mac products, the Company believes the availability of third‑party software applications and services depends in part on the developers’ perception and analysis of the relative benefits of developing, maintaining and upgrading such software for the Company’s products compared to Windows-based products. This analysis may be based on factors such as the market position of the Company and its products, the anticipated revenue that may be generated, expected future growth of Mac sales and the costs of developing such applications and services. If the Company’s minority share of the global personal computer market causes developers to question the Mac’s prospects, developers could be less inclined to develop or upgrade software for the Company’s Mac products and more inclined to devote their resources to developing and upgrading software for the larger Windows market. With respect to iOS devices, the Company relies on the continued availability and development of compelling and innovative software applications, which are distributed through a single distribution channel, the App Store. iOS devices are subject to rapid technological change, and, if third-party developers are unable to or choose not to keep up with this pace of change, third-party applications might not successfully operate and may result in dissatisfied customers. As with applications for the Company’s Mac products, the availability and development of these applications also depend on developers’ perceptions and analysis of the relative benefits of developing, maintaining or upgrading software for the Company’s iOS devices rather than its competitors’ platforms, such as Android. If developers focus their efforts on these competing platforms, the availability and quality of applications for the Company’s iOS devices may suffer. Apple Inc. | 2016 Form 10-K | 11



The Company relies on access to third-party intellectual property, which may not be available to the Company on commercially reasonable terms or at all.Many of the Company’s products include third-party intellectual property, which requires licenses from those third parties. Based on past experience and industry practice, the Company believes such licenses generally can be obtained on reasonable terms. There is, however, no assurance that the necessary licenses can be obtained on acceptable terms or at all. Failure to obtain the right to use third-party intellectual property, or to use such intellectual property on commercially reasonable terms, could preclude the Company from selling certain products or otherwise have a material adverse impact on the Company’s financial condition and operating results. The Company could be impacted by unfavorable results of legal proceedings, such as being found to have infringed on intellectual property rights.The Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that have not yet been fully resolved and that have arisen in the ordinary course of business, and additional claims may arise in the future.For example, technology companies, including many of the Company’s competitors, frequently enter into litigation based on allegations of patent infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. In addition, patent holding companies seek to monetize patents they have purchased or otherwise obtained. The intellectual property rights claims against the Company have generally increased over time and may continue to increase. In particular, the Company's cellular enabled products compete with products from mobile communication and media device companies that hold significant patent portfolios, and the Company has faced a significant number of patent claims against it. The Company is vigorously defending infringement actions in courts in a number of U.S. jurisdictions and before the U.S. International Trade Commission, as well as internationally in various countries. The plaintiffs in these actions frequently seek injunctions and substantial damages. Regardless of the scope or validity of such patents or other intellectual property rights, or the merits of any claims by potential or actual litigants, the Company may have to engage in protracted litigation. If the Company is found to infringe one or more patents or other intellectual property rights, regardless of whether it can develop non-infringing technology, it may be required to pay substantial damages or royalties to a third-party, or it may be subject to a temporary or permanent injunction prohibiting the Company from marketing or selling certain products.  In certain cases, the Company may consider the desirability of entering into licensing agreements, although no assurance can be given that such licenses can be obtained on acceptable terms or that litigation will not occur. These licenses may also significantly increase the Company’s operating expenses. Regardless of the merit of particular claims, litigation may be expensive, time-consuming, disruptive to the Company’s operations and distracting to management. In recognition of these considerations, the Company may enter into arrangements to settle litigation.In management’s opinion, there is not at least a reasonable possibility the Company may have incurred a material loss, or a material loss in excess of a recorded accrual, with respect to loss contingencies, including matters related to infringement of intellectual property rights. However, the outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain. Although management considers the likelihood of such an outcome to be remote, if one or more legal matters were resolved against the Company in a reporting period for amounts in excess of management’s expectations, the Company’s consolidated financial statements for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected. Further, such an outcome could result in significant compensatory, punitive or trebled monetary damages, disgorgement of revenue or profits, remedial corporate measures or injunctive relief against the Company that could materially adversely affect its financial condition and operating results. The Company is subject to laws and regulations worldwide, changes to which could increase the Company’s costs and individually or in the aggregate adversely affect the Company’s business.The Company is subject to laws and regulations affecting its domestic and international operations in a number of areas. These U.S. and foreign laws and regulations affect the Company’s activities including, but not limited to, in areas of labor, advertising, digital content, consumer protection, real estate, billing, e-commerce, promotions, quality of services, telecommunications, mobile communications and media, television, intellectual property ownership and infringement, tax, import and export requirements, anti-corruption, foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions, data privacy requirements, anti-competition, environmental, health and safety.By way of example, laws and regulations related to mobile communications and media devices in the many jurisdictions in which the Company operates are extensive and subject to change. Such changes could include, among others, restrictions on the production, manufacture, distribution and use of devices, locking devices to a carrier’s network, or mandating the use of devices on more than one carrier’s network. These devices are also subject to certification and regulation by governmental and standardization bodies, as well as by cellular network carriers for use on their networks. These certification processes are extensive and time consuming, and could result in additional testing requirements, product modifications, or delays in product shipment dates, or could preclude the Company from selling certain products.  Apple Inc. | 2016 Form 10-K | 12



Compliance with these laws, regulations and similar requirements may be onerous and expensive, and they may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, further increasing the cost of compliance and doing business. Any such costs, which may rise in the future as a result of changes in these laws and regulations or in their interpretation, could individually or in the aggregate make the Company’s products and services less attractive to the Company’s customers, delay the introduction of new products in one or more regions, or cause the Company to change or limit its business practices. The Company has implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations, but there can be no assurance that the Company’s employees, contractors, or agents will not violate such laws and regulations or the Company’s policies and procedures. The Company’s business is subject to the risks of international operations.The Company derives a significant portion of its revenue and earnings from its international operations. Compliance with applicable U.S. and foreign laws and regulations, such as import and export requirements, anti-corruption laws, tax laws, foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions, data privacy requirements, environmental laws, labor laws and anti-competition regulations, increases the costs of doing business in foreign jurisdictions. Although the Company has implemented policies and procedures to comply with these laws and regulations, a violation by the Company’s employees, contractors, or agents could nevertheless occur. In some cases, compliance with the laws and regulations of one country could violate the laws and regulations of another country. Violations of these laws and regulations could materially adversely affect the Company’s brand, international growth efforts and business.The Company also could be significantly affected by other risks associated with international activities including, but not limited to, economic and labor conditions, increased duties, taxes and other costs and political instability. Margins on sales of the Company’s products in foreign countries, and on sales of products that include components obtained from foreign suppliers, could be materially adversely affected by international trade regulations, including duties, tariffs and antidumping penalties. The Company is also exposed to credit and collectability risk on its trade receivables with customers in certain international markets. There can be no assurance the Company can effectively limit its credit risk and avoid losses.The Company’s retail stores have required and will continue to require a substantial investment and commitment of resources and are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties.The Company’s retail stores have required substantial investment in equipment and leasehold improvements, information systems, inventory and personnel. The Company also has entered into substantial operating lease commitments for retail space. Certain stores have been designed and built to serve as high-profile venues to promote brand awareness and serve as vehicles for corporate sales and marketing activities. Because of their unique design elements, locations and size, these stores require substantially more investment than the Company’s more typical retail stores. Due to the high cost structure associated with the Company’s retail stores, a decline in sales or the closure or poor performance of individual or multiple stores could result in significant lease termination costs, write-offs of equipment and leasehold improvements and severance costs. Many factors unique to retail operations, some of which are beyond the Company’s control, pose risks and uncertainties. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, macro-economic factors that could have an adverse effect on general retail activity, as well as the Company’s inability to manage costs associated with store construction and operation, the Company’s failure to manage relationships with its existing retail partners, more challenging environments in managing retail operations outside the U.S., costs associated with unanticipated fluctuations in the value of retail inventory, and the Company’s inability to obtain and renew leases in quality retail locations at a reasonable cost.Investment in new business strategies and acquisitions could disrupt the Company’s ongoing business and present risks not originally contemplated.The Company has invested, and in the future may invest, in new business strategies or acquisitions. Such endeavors may involve significant risks and uncertainties, including distraction of management from current operations, greater than expected liabilities and expenses, inadequate return of capital and unidentified issues not discovered in the Company’s due diligence. These new ventures are inherently risky and may not be successful. The Company’s business and reputation may be impacted by information technology system failures or network disruptions.The Company may be subject to information technology system failures and network disruptions. These may be caused by natural disasters, accidents, power disruptions, telecommunications failures, acts of terrorism or war, computer viruses, physical or electronic break-ins, or other events or disruptions. System redundancy may be ineffective or inadequate, and the Company’s disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities. Such failures or disruptions could, among other things, prevent access to the Company’s online stores and services, preclude retail store transactions, compromise Company or customer data, and result in delayed or cancelled orders. System failures and disruptions could also impede the manufacturing and shipping of products, delivery of online services, transactions processing and financial reporting.Apple Inc. | 2016 Form 10-K | 13



There may be breaches of the Company’s information technology systems that materially damage business partner and customer relationships, curtail or otherwise adversely impact access to online stores and services, or subject the Company to significant reputational, financial, legal and operational consequences.The Company’s business requires it to use and store customer, employee and business partner personally identifiable information (“PII”). This may include, among other information, names, addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, contact preferences, tax identification numbers and payment account information. Although malicious attacks to gain access to PII affect many companies across various industries, the Company is at a relatively greater risk of being targeted because of its high profile and the amount of PII it manages.  The Company requires user names and passwords in order to access its information technology systems. The Company also uses encryption and authentication technologies designed to secure the transmission and storage of data and prevent access to Company data or accounts. As with all companies, these security measures are subject to third-party security breaches, employee error, malfeasance, faulty password management, or other irregularities. For example, third parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees or customers into disclosing user names, passwords or other sensitive information, which may in turn be used to access the Company’s information technology systems. To help protect customers and the Company, the Company monitors accounts and systems for unusual activity and may freeze accounts under suspicious circumstances, which may result in the delay or loss of customer orders. The Company devotes significant resources to network security, data encryption and other security measures to protect its systems and data, but these security measures cannot provide absolute security. To the extent the Company was to experience a breach of its systems and was unable to protect sensitive data, such a breach could materially damage business partner and customer relationships, and curtail or otherwise adversely impact access to online stores and services. Moreover, if a computer security breach affects the Company’s systems or results in the unauthorized release of PII, the Company’s reputation and brand could be materially damaged, use of the Company’s products and services could decrease, and the Company could be exposed to a risk of loss or litigation and possible liability. While the Company maintains insurance coverage that, subject to policy terms and conditions and subject to a significant self-insured retention, is designed to address certain aspects of cyber risks, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise in the continually evolving area of cyber risk.The Company is also subject to payment card association rules and obligations under its contracts with payment card processors. Under these rules and obligations, if information is compromised, the Company could be liable to payment card issuers for associated expenses and penalties. In addition, if the Company fails to follow payment card industry security standards, even if no customer information is compromised, the Company could incur significant fines or experience a significant increase in payment card transaction costs.The Company’s business is subject to a variety of U.S. and international laws, rules, policies and other obligations regarding data protection.The Company is subject to federal, state and international laws relating to the collection, use, retention, security and transfer of PII. In many cases, these laws apply not only to third-party transactions, but also may restrict transfers of PII among the Company and its international subsidiaries. Several jurisdictions have passed laws in this area, and other jurisdictions are considering imposing additional restrictions. These laws continue to develop and may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Complying with emerging and changing international requirements may cause the Company to incur substantial costs or require the Company to change its business practices. Noncompliance could result in significant penalties or legal liability.The Company makes statements about its use and disclosure of PII through its privacy policy, information provided on its website and press statements. Any failure by the Company to comply with these public statements or with other federal, state or international privacy-related or data protection laws and regulations could result in proceedings against the Company by governmental entities or others. Penalties could include ongoing audit requirements or significant legal liability.The Company’s success depends largely on the continued service and availability of key personnel.Much of the Company’s future success depends on the continued availability and service of key personnel, including its Chief Executive Officer, executive team and other highly skilled employees. Experienced personnel in the technology industry are in high demand and competition for their talents is intense, especially in Silicon Valley, where most of the Company’s key personnel are located.Apple Inc. | 2016 Form 10-K | 14



The Company’s business may be impacted by political events, war, terrorism, public health issues, natural disasters and other business interruptions.War, terrorism, geopolitical uncertainties, public health issues and other business interruptions have caused and could cause damage or disruption to international commerce and the global economy, and thus could have a material adverse effect on the Company, its suppliers, logistics providers, manufacturing vendors and customers, including channel partners. The Company’s business operations are subject to interruption by, among others, natural disasters, whether as a result of climate change or otherwise, fire, power shortages, nuclear power plant accidents and other industrial accidents, terrorist attacks and other hostile acts, labor disputes, public health issues and other events beyond its control. Such events could decrease demand for the Company’s products, make it difficult or impossible for the Company to make and deliver products to its customers, including channel partners, or to receive components from its suppliers, and create delays and inefficiencies in the Company’s supply chain. While the Company's suppliers are required to maintain safe working environments and operations, an industrial accident could occur and could result in disruption to the Company's business and harm to the Company's reputation. Should major public health issues, including pandemics, arise, the Company could be adversely affected by more stringent employee travel restrictions, additional limitations in freight services, governmental actions limiting the movement of products between regions, delays in production ramps of new products and disruptions in the operations of the Company’s manufacturing vendors and component suppliers. The majority of the Company’s R&D activities, its corporate headquarters, information technology systems and other critical business operations, including certain component suppliers and manufacturing vendors, are in locations that could be affected by natural disasters. In the event of a natural disaster, the Company could incur significant losses, require substantial recovery time and experience significant expenditures in order to resume operations.The Company expects its quarterly revenue and operating results to fluctuate.The Company’s profit margins vary across its products and distribution channels. The Company’s software, accessories, and service and support contracts generally have higher gross margins than certain of the Company’s other products. Gross margins on the Company’s hardware products vary across product lines and can change over time as a result of product transitions, pricing and configuration changes, and component, warranty, and other cost fluctuations. The Company’s direct sales generally have higher associated gross margins than its indirect sales through its channel partners. In addition, the Company’s gross margin and operating margin percentages, as well as overall profitability, may be materially adversely impacted as a result of a shift in product, geographic or channel mix, component cost increases, the strengthening U.S. dollar, price competition, or the introduction of new products, including those that have higher cost structures with flat or reduced pricing. The Company has typically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters due in part to seasonal holiday demand. Additionally, new product introductions can significantly impact net sales, product costs and operating expenses. Further, the Company generates a majority of its net sales from a single product and a decline in demand for that product could significantly impact quarterly net sales. The Company could also be subject to unexpected developments late in a quarter, such as lower-than-anticipated demand for the Company’s products, issues with new product introductions, an internal systems failure, or failure of one of the Company’s logistics, components supply, or manufacturing partners. The Company’s stock price is subject to volatility.The Company’s stock price has experienced substantial price volatility in the past and may continue to do so in the future. Additionally, the Company, the technology industry and the stock market as a whole have experienced extreme stock price and volume fluctuations that have affected stock prices in ways that may have been unrelated to these companies’ operating performance. Price volatility over a given period may cause the average price at which the Company repurchases its own stock to exceed the stock’s price at a given point in time. The Company believes its stock price should reflect expectations of future growth and profitability. The Company also believes its stock price should reflect expectations that its cash dividend will continue at current levels or grow and that its current share repurchase program will be fully consummated. Future dividends are subject to declaration by the Company’s Board of Directors, and the Company’s share repurchase program does not obligate it to acquire any specific number of shares. If the Company fails to meet expectations related to future growth, profitability, dividends, share repurchases or other market expectations, its stock price may decline significantly, which could have a material adverse impact on investor confidence and employee retention.

The Company’s financial performance is subject to risks associated with changes in the value of the U.S. dollar versus local currencies.The Company’s primary exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates relates to non-U.S. dollar-denominated sales and operating expenses worldwide. Weakening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar adversely affects the U.S. dollar value of the Company’s foreign currency-denominated sales and earnings, and generally leads the Company to raise international pricing, potentially reducing demand for the Company’s products. Margins on sales of the Company’s products in foreign countries and on sales of products that include components obtained from foreign suppliers, could be materially adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. In some circumstances, for competitive or other reasons, the Company may decide not to raise local prices to fully offset the dollar’s strengthening, or at all, which would adversely affect the U.S. dollar value of the Company’s foreign currency-denominated sales and earnings. Conversely, a strengthening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, while generally beneficial to the Company’s foreign currency-denominated sales and earnings, could cause the Company to reduce international pricing and incur losses on its foreign currency derivative instruments, thereby limiting the benefit. Additionally, strengthening of foreign currencies may also increase the Company’s cost of product components denominated in those currencies, thus adversely affecting gross margins.The Company uses derivative instruments, such as foreign currency forward and option contracts, to hedge certain exposures to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. The use of such hedging activities may not offset any, or more than a portion, of the adverse financial effects of unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates over the limited time the hedges are in place.The Company is exposed to credit risk and fluctuations in the market values of its investment portfolio.Given the global nature of its business, the Company has both domestic and international investments. Credit ratings and pricing of the Company’s investments can be negatively affected by liquidity, credit deterioration, financial results, economic risk, political risk, sovereign risk or other factors. As a result, the value and liquidity of the Company’s cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities may fluctuate substantially. Therefore, although the Company has not realized any significant losses on its cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, future fluctuations in their value could result in a significant realized loss.The Company is exposed to credit risk on its trade accounts receivable, vendor non-trade receivables and prepayments related to long-term supply agreements, and this risk is heightened during periods when economic conditions worsen.The Company distributes its products through third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers and value-added resellers. The Company also sells its products directly to small and mid-sized businesses and education, enterprise and government customers. A substantial majority of the Company’s outstanding trade receivables are not covered by collateral, third-party financing arrangements or credit insurance. The Company’s exposure to credit and collectability risk on its trade receivables is higher in certain international markets and its ability to mitigate such risks may be limited. The Company also has unsecured vendor non-trade receivables resulting from purchases of components by outsourcing partners and other vendors that manufacture sub-assemblies or assemble final products for the Company. In addition, the Company has made prepayments associated with long-term supply agreements to secure supply of inventory components. As of September 24, 2016, a significant portion of the Company’s trade receivables was concentrated within cellular network carriers, and its vendor non-trade receivables and prepayments related to long-term supply agreements were concentrated among a few individual vendors located primarily in Asia. While the Company has procedures to monitor and limit exposure to credit risk on its trade and vendor non-trade receivables, as well as long-term prepayments, there can be no assurance such procedures will effectively limit its credit risk and avoid losses.The Company could be subject to changes in its tax rates, the adoption of new U.S. or international tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities.The Company is subject to taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions, including Ireland, where a number of the Company’s subsidiaries are organized. Due to economic and political conditions, tax rates in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change. The Company’s effective tax rates could be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, or changes in tax laws or their interpretation, including in the U.S. and Ireland. The Company is also subject to the examination of its tax returns and other tax matters by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (the "IRS") and other tax authorities and governmental bodies. The Company regularly assesses the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of its provision for taxes. There can be no assurance as to the outcome of these examinations. If the Company’s effective tax rates were to increase, particularly in the U.S. or Ireland, or if the ultimate determination of the Company’s taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued, the Company’s financial condition, operating results and cash flows could be adversely affected.

Product PerformanceiPhoneThe following table presents iPhone net sales and unit sales information for 2016, 2015 and 2014 (dollars in millions and units in thousands):iPhone net sales and unit sales decreased during 2016 compared to 2015. The Company believes the sales decline is due primarily to a lower rate of iPhone upgrades during 2016 compared to 2015 and challenging macroeconomic conditions in a number of major markets in 2016. Average selling prices (“ASPs”) for iPhone were lower year-over-year during 2016 due primarily to a different mix of iPhones, including the iPhone SE introduced in 2016, and the effect of weakness in most foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar.The year-over-year growth in iPhone net sales and unit sales during 2015 primarily resulted from strong demand for iPhone 6 and 6 Plus during 2015. Overall ASPs for iPhone increased during 2015 compared to 2014, due primarily to the introduction of iPhone 6 and 6 Plus in September 2014, partially offset by the effect of weakness in most foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar.iPadThe following table presents iPad net sales and unit sales information for 2016, 2015 and 2014 (dollars in millions and units in thousands):iPad net sales decreased during 2016 compared to 2015 primarily due to lower unit sales and the effect of weakness in most foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, partially offset by higher ASPs due to a shift in mix to higher-priced iPads. The Company believes the decline in iPad sales is due in part to a longer repurchase cycle for iPads and some level of cannibalization from the Company's other products.Net sales and unit sales for iPad declined during 2015 compared to 2014. The Company believes the decline in iPad sales is due in part to a longer repurchase cycle for iPads and some level of cannibalization from the Company's other products. iPad ASPs declined during 2015 compared to 2014, primarily as a result of the effect of weakness in most foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar and a shift in mix to lower-priced iPads. MacThe following table presents Mac net sales and unit sales information for 2016, 2015 and 2014 (dollars in millions and units in thousands):Mac net sales and unit sales decreased during 2016 compared to 2015. The year-over-year decline in Mac unit sales during 2016 was at rates similar to the overall market. The effect of weakness in most foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar also negatively impacted Mac net sales.The year-over-year growth in Mac net sales and unit sales during 2015 was driven by strong demand for Mac portables. Mac ASPs declined during 2015 compared to 2014 largely due to the effect of weakness in most foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar.Apple Inc. | 2016 Form 10-K | 24

ServicesThe following table presents net sales information of Services for 2016, 2015 and 2014 (dollars in millions):The year-over-year increase in net sales of Services in 2016 was due primarily to growth from the App Store, licensing and AppleCare sales, partially offset by the effect of weakness in most foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar. During the first quarter of 2016, the Company received $548 million from Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. related to its patent infringement lawsuit, which was recorded as licensing net sales within Services.The increase in net sales of Services during 2015 compared to 2014 was primarily due to growth from the App Store and licensing. Segment Operating PerformanceThe Company manages its business primarily on a geographic basis. The Company’s reportable operating segments consist of the Americas, Europe, Greater China, Japan and Rest of Asia Pacific. The Americas segment includes both North and South America. The Europe segment includes European countries, as well as India, the Middle East and Africa. The Greater China segment includes China, Hong Kong and Taiwan. The Rest of Asia Pacific segment includes Australia and those Asian countries not included in the Company’s other reportable operating segments. Although the reportable operating segments provide similar hardware and software products and similar services, each one is managed separately to better align with the location of the Company’s customers and distribution partners and the unique market dynamics of each geographic region. Further information regarding the Company’s reportable operating segments can be found in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Note 11, “Segment Information and Geographic Data.”AmericasThe following table presents Americas net sales information for 2016, 2015 and 2014 (dollars in millions):Americas net sales decreased during 2016 compared to 2015 due primarily to lower net sales and unit sales of iPhone.The year-over-year growth in Americas net sales during 2015 was driven primarily by growth in net sales and unit sales of iPhone, partially offset by a decline in net sales and unit sales of iPad.EuropeThe following table presents Europe net sales information for 2016, 2015 and 2014 (dollars in millions):Europe net sales decreased during 2016 compared to 2015 driven primarily by the effect of weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar and a decrease in unit sales of Mac, largely offset by an increase in iPhone unit sales and Services.The year-over-year increase in Europe net sales during 2015 was driven primarily by growth in net sales and unit sales of iPhone, partially offset by the effect of weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar and a decline in net sales and unit sales of iPad.Apple Inc. | 2016 Form 10-K | 25

Greater ChinaThe following table presents Greater China net sales information for 2016, 2015 and 2014 (dollars in millions):Greater China net sales decreased during 2016 compared to 2015 due primarily to lower net sales and unit sales of iPhone and the effect of weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar.Greater China experienced strong year-over-year increases in net sales during 2015 driven primarily by iPhone sales.JapanThe following table presents Japan net sales information for 2016, 2015 and 2014 (dollars in millions):Japan net sales increased during 2016 compared to 2015 due primarily to higher net sales of Services and the strength in the Japanese yen relative to the U.S. dollar.The year-over-year increase in Japan net sales during 2015 was driven primarily by growth in Services largely associated with strong App Store sales, partially offset by the effect of weakness in the Japanese yen relative to the U.S. dollar.Rest of Asia PacificThe following table presents Rest of Asia Pacific net sales information for 2016, 2015 and 2014 (dollars in millions):Rest of Asia Pacific net sales decreased during 2016 compared to 2015 due primarily to lower net sales and unit sales of iPhone and the effect of weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar.The year-over-year increase in Rest of Asia Pacific net sales during 2015 primarily reflects strong growth in net sales and unit sales of iPhone, partially offset by the effect of weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar and a decline in net sales and unit sales of iPad.Gross MarginGross margin for 2016, 2015 and 2014 is as follows (dollars in millions):Gross margin decreased in 2016 compared to 2015 due primarily to the effect of weakness in most foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar and, to a lesser extent, unfavorable leverage on fixed costs from lower net sales, partially offset by a favorable shift in mix to Services.The year-over-year increase in the gross margin percentage in 2015 was driven primarily by a favorable shift in mix to products with higher margins and, to a lesser extent, by improved leverage on fixed costs from higher net sales. These positive factors were partially offset primarily by higher product cost structures and, to a lesser extent, by the effect of weakness in most foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar.Apple Inc. | 2016 Form 10-K | 26

The Company anticipates gross margin during the first quarter of 2017 to be between 38% and 38.5%. The foregoing statement regarding the Company’s expected gross margin percentage in the first quarter of 2017 is forward-looking and could differ from actual results. The Company’s future gross margins can be impacted by multiple factors including, but not limited to, those set forth in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K under the heading “Risk Factors” and those described in this paragraph. In general, the Company believes gross margins will remain under downward pressure due to a variety of factors, including continued industry wide global product pricing pressures, increased competition, compressed product life cycles, product transitions, potential increases in the cost of components, and potential strengthening of the U.S. dollar, as well as potential increases in the costs of outside manufacturing services and a potential shift in the Company’s sales mix towards products with lower gross margins. In response to competitive pressures, the Company expects it will continue to take product pricing actions, which would adversely affect gross margins. Gross margins could also be affected by the Company’s ability to manage product quality and warranty costs effectively and to stimulate demand for certain of its products. Due to the Company’s significant international operations, its financial condition and operating results, including gross margins, could be significantly affected by fluctuations in exchange rates.Operating ExpensesOperating expenses for 2016, 2015 and 2014 are as follows (dollars in millions):Research and DevelopmentThe year-over-year growth in R&D expense in 2016 and 2015 was driven primarily by an increase in headcount and related expenses, and material costs to support expanded R&D activities. The Company continues to believe that focused investments in R&D are critical to its future growth and competitive position in the marketplace, and to the development of new and updated products that are central to the Company’s core business strategy.Selling, General and AdministrativeThe decrease in selling, general and administrative expense in 2016 compared to 2015 was due primarily to lower discretionary expenditures and advertising costs, partially offset by an increase in headcount and related expenses. The year-over-year growth in selling, general and administrative expense in 2015 was primarily due to increased headcount and related expenses, and higher spending on marketing and advertising.Other Income/(Expense), NetOther income/(expense), net for 2016, 2015 and 2014 are as follows (dollars in millions):The year-over-year increase in other income/(expense), net during 2016 and 2015 was due primarily to higher interest income, partially offset by higher interest expense on debt and higher expenses associated with foreign exchange activity. The weighted-average interest rate earned by the Company on its cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities was 1.73%, 1.49% and 1.11% in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.Apple Inc. | 2016 Form 10-K | 27

Provision for Income TaxesProvision for income taxes and effective tax rates for 2016, 2015 and 2014 are as follows (dollars in millions):The Company’s effective tax rates for 2016, 2015 and 2014 differ from the statutory federal income tax rate of 35% due primarily to certain undistributed foreign earnings, a substantial portion of which was generated by subsidiaries organized in Ireland, for which no U.S. taxes are provided when such earnings are intended to be indefinitely reinvested outside the U.S. The lower effective tax rate in 2016 compared to 2015 was due primarily to greater R&D tax credits. The higher effective tax rate during 2015 compared to 2014 was due primarily to higher foreign taxes. As of September 24, 2016, the Company had deferred tax assets arising from deductible temporary differences, tax losses and tax credits of $4.1 billion and deferred tax liabilities of $26.0 billion. Management believes it is more likely than not that forecasted income, including income that may be generated as a result of certain tax planning strategies, together with future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, will be sufficient to fully recover the deferred tax assets. The Company will continue to evaluate the realizability of deferred tax assets quarterly by assessing the need for and the amount of a valuation allowance.During the fourth quarter of 2016, the Company reached a partial settlement with the IRS on its examination of the years 2010 through 2012. In connection with this settlement, the Company recognized a tax benefit in the fourth quarter of 2016 that was not significant to its consolidated financial statements. All years prior to 2013 are closed, except for the years 2010 through 2012 relating to R&D tax credits. In addition, the Company is subject to audits by state, local and foreign tax authorities. In major states and major foreign jurisdictions, the years subsequent to 2003 generally remain open and could be subject to examination by the taxing authorities. Management believes that adequate provisions have been made for any adjustments that may result from tax examinations. However, the outcome of tax audits cannot be predicted with certainty. If any issues addressed in the Company’s tax audits are resolved in a manner not consistent with management’s expectations, the Company could be required to adjust its provision for income taxes in the period such resolution occurs.On August 30, 2016, the European Commission announced its decision that Ireland granted state aid to the Company by providing tax opinions in 1991 and 2007 concerning the tax allocation of profits of the Irish branches of two subsidiaries of the Company (the "State Aid Decision"). The State Aid Decision orders Ireland to calculate and recover additional taxes from the Company for the period June 2003 through September 2014. Irish legislative changes, effective as of the beginning of 2015, eliminated the application of the tax opinions from that date forward. The Company believes the State Aid Decision to be without merit and intends to appeal to the General Court of the Court of Justice of the European Union. Ireland has also announced its intention to appeal the State Aid Decision. While the European Commission announced a recovery amount of up to €13 billion, plus interest, the actual amount of additional taxes subject to recovery is to be calculated by Ireland in accordance with the European Commission's guidance. Once the recovery amount is computed by Ireland, the Company anticipates funding it, including interest, out of foreign cash into escrow, pending conclusion of all appeals. The Company believes that any incremental Irish corporate income taxes potentially due would be creditable against U.S. taxes. Recent Accounting PronouncementsIncome TaxesIn October 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2016-16, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Intra-Entity Transfer of Assets Other than Inventory ("ASU 2016-16"), which requires the recognition of the income tax consequences of an intra-entity transfer of an asset, other than inventory, when the transfer occurs. ASU 2016-06 will be effective for the Company in its first quarter of 2019. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting ASU 2016-16 on its consolidated financial statements.Stock CompensationIn March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09, Compensation – Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting (“ASU 2016-09”), which simplified certain aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including income taxes, classification of awards and classification on the statement of cash flows. ASU 2016-09 will be effective for the Company beginning in its first quarter of 2018. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting ASU 2016-09 on its consolidated financial statements.Apple Inc. | 2016 Form 10-K | 28

Leases In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) (“ASU 2016-02”), which modified lease accounting for both lessees and lessors to increase transparency and comparability by recognizing lease assets and lease liabilities by lessees for those leases classified as operating leases under previous accounting standards and disclosing key information about leasing arrangements. ASU 2016-02 will be effective for the Company beginning in its first quarter of 2020, and early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the timing of its adoption and the impact of adopting ASU 2016-02 on its consolidated financial statements.Financial Instruments In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-01, Financial Instruments – Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities (“ASU 2016-01”), which updates certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of financial instruments. ASU 2016-01 will be effective for the Company beginning in its first quarter of 2019. The Company does not believe the adoption of ASU 2016-01 will have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements. In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments – Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments (“ASU 2016-13”), which modifies the measurement of expected credit losses of certain financial instruments. ASU 2016-13 will be effective for the Company beginning in its first quarter of 2021 and early adoption is permitted. The Company does not believe the adoption of ASU 2016-13 will have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements. Revenue Recognition In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) (“ASU 2014-09”), which amends the existing accounting standards for revenue recognition. ASU 2014-09 is based on principles that govern the recognition of revenue at an amount an entity expects to be entitled when products are transferred to customers. ASU 2014-09 will be effective for the Company beginning in its first quarter of 2019, and early adoption is permitted. Subsequently, the FASB has issued the following standards related to ASU 2014-09: ASU No. 2016-08, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Principal versus Agent Considerations (“ASU 2016-08”); ASU No. 2016-10, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing (“ASU 2016-10”); and ASU No. 2016-12, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients (“ASU 2016-12”). The Company must adopt ASU 2016-08, ASU 2016-10 and ASU 2016-12 with ASU 2014-09 (collectively, the “new revenue standards”). The new revenue standards may be applied retrospectively to each prior period presented or retrospectively with the cumulative effect recognized as of the date of adoption. The Company currently expects to adopt the new revenue standards in its first quarter of 2018 utilizing the full retrospective transition method. The Company does not expect adoption of the new revenue standards to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.Liquidity and Capital ResourcesThe following table presents selected financial information and statistics as of and for the years ended September 24, 2016, September 26, 2015 and September 27, 2014 (in millions):The Company believes its existing balances of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities will be sufficient to satisfy its working capital needs, capital asset purchases, outstanding commitments and other liquidity requirements associated with its existing operations over the next 12 months. The Company currently anticipates the cash used for future dividends, the share repurchase program and debt repayments will come from its current domestic cash, cash generated from on-going U.S. operating activities and from borrowings.Apple Inc. | 2016 Form 10-K | 29

As of September 24, 2016 and September 26, 2015, the Company’s cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities held by foreign subsidiaries were $216.0 billion and $186.9 billion, respectively, and are generally based in U.S. dollar-denominated holdings. Amounts held by foreign subsidiaries are generally subject to U.S. income taxation on repatriation to the U.S. In connection with the State Aid Decision, the European Commission announced a recovery amount of up to €13 billion, plus interest. The actual amount of additional taxes subject to recovery is to be calculated by Ireland in accordance with the European Commission's guidance. Once the recovery amount is computed by Ireland, the Company anticipates funding it, including interest, out of foreign cash into escrow, pending conclusion of all appeals. The Company’s marketable securities investment portfolio is invested primarily in highly-rated securities and its investment policy generally limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. The policy requires investments generally to be investment grade with the objective of minimizing the potential risk of principal loss.During 2016, cash generated from operating activities of $65.8 billion was a result of $45.7 billion of net income, non-cash adjustments to net income of $19.7 billion and an increase in the net change in operating assets and liabilities of $484 million. Cash used in investing activities of $46.0 billion during 2016 consisted primarily of cash used for purchases of marketable securities, net of sales and maturities, of $30.6 billion and cash used to acquire property, plant and equipment of $12.7 billion. Cash used in financing activities of $20.5 billion during 2016 consisted primarily of cash used to repurchase common stock of $29.7 billion, cash used to pay dividends and dividend equivalents of $12.2 billion and cash used to repay term debt of $2.5 billion, partially offset by net proceeds from the issuance of term debt of $25.0 billion.During 2015, cash generated from operating activities of $81.3 billion was a result of $53.4 billion of net income, non-cash adjustments to net income of $16.2 billion and an increase in the net change in operating assets and liabilities of $11.6 billion. Cash used in investing activities of $56.3 billion during 2015 consisted primarily of cash used for purchases of marketable securities, net of sales and maturities, of $44.4 billion and cash used to acquire property, plant and equipment of $11.2 billion. Cash used in financing activities of $17.7 billion during 2015 consisted primarily of cash used to repurchase common stock of $35.3 billion and cash used to pay dividends and dividend equivalents of $11.6 billion, partially offset by net proceeds from the issuance of term debt of $27.1 billion. Capital AssetsThe Company’s capital expenditures were $12.8 billion during 2016. The Company anticipates utilizing approximately $16.0 billion for capital expenditures during 2017, which includes product tooling and manufacturing process equipment; data centers; corporate facilities and infrastructure, including information systems hardware, software and enhancements; and retail store facilities.DebtThe Company issues unsecured short-term promissory notes (“Commercial Paper”) pursuant to a commercial paper program. The Company uses the net proceeds from the commercial paper program for general corporate purposes, including dividends and share repurchases. As of September 24, 2016, the Company had $8.1 billion of Commercial Paper outstanding, with a weighted-average interest rate of 0.45% and maturities generally less than nine months.As of September 24, 2016, the Company has outstanding floating- and fixed-rate notes with varying maturities for an aggregate principal amount of $78.4 billion (collectively the “Notes”). During 2016, the Company repaid $2.5 billion of its Notes upon maturity. The Company has entered, and in the future may enter, into interest rate swaps to manage interest rate risk on the Notes. In addition, the Company has entered, and in the future may enter, into currency swaps to manage foreign currency risk on the Notes. The future principal payments for the Company’s Notes as of September 24, 2016 are as follows (in millions):Further information regarding the Company’s debt issuances and related hedging activity can be found in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Note 2, “Financial Instruments” and Note 6, “Debt.”Apple Inc. | 2016 Form 10-K | 30

Capital Return ProgramIn April 2016, the Company’s Board of Directors increased the share repurchase program authorization from $140 billion to $175 billion of the Company’s common stock, increasing the expected total size of the capital return program from $200 billion to $250 billion. Additionally in April 2016, the Company announced that the Board of Directors raised the rate of the Company's quarterly cash dividend by 10% from $0.52 to $0.57 per share, beginning with the dividend paid during the third quarter of 2016. The Company intends to increase its dividend on an annual basis subject to declaration by the Board of Directors. As of September 24, 2016, $133 billion of the share repurchase program has been utilized. The Company’s share repurchase program does not obligate it to acquire any specific number of shares. Under the program, shares may be repurchased in privately negotiated or open market transactions, including under plans complying with Rule 10b5-1 under the Exchange Act.The following table presents the Company’s dividends, dividend equivalents, share repurchases and net share settlement activity from the start of the capital return program in August 2012 through September 24, 2016 (in millions):The Company expects to execute its capital return program by the end of March 2018 by paying dividends and dividend equivalents, repurchasing shares and remitting withheld taxes related to net share settlement of restricted stock units. The Company plans to continue to access the domestic and international debt markets to assist in funding its capital return program. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual ObligationsThe Company has not entered into any transactions with unconsolidated entities whereby the Company has financial guarantees, subordinated retained interests, derivative instruments, or other contingent arrangements that expose the Company to material continuing risks, contingent liabilities, or any other obligation under a variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing, liquidity, market risk, or credit risk support to the Company, or engages in leasing, hedging, or R&D services with the Company.The following table presents certain payments due by the Company under contractual obligations with minimum firm commitments as of September 24, 2016, and excludes amounts already recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, except for term debt (in millions):Operating LeasesAs of September 24, 2016, the Company’s total future minimum lease payments under noncancelable operating leases were $7.6 billion. The Company’s retail store and other facility leases are typically for terms not exceeding 10 years and generally contain multi-year renewal options. Apple Inc. | 2016 Form 10-K | 31



Manufacturing Purchase Obligations The Company utilizes several outsourcing partners to manufacture sub-assemblies for the Company’s products and to perform final assembly and testing of finished products. These outsourcing partners acquire components and build product based on demand information supplied by the Company, which typically covers periods up to 150 days. The Company also obtains individual components for its products from a wide variety of individual suppliers. Consistent with industry practice, the Company acquires components through a combination of purchase orders, supplier contracts, and open orders based on projected demand information. As of September 24, 2016, the Company had manufacturing purchase obligations of $28.6 billion.Other Purchase ObligationsThe Company’s other purchase obligations were comprised of commitments to acquire capital assets, including product tooling and manufacturing process equipment, and commitments related to advertising, licensing, R&D, internet and telecommunications services, energy and other obligations.  As of September 24, 2016, the Company had other purchase obligations of $6.6 billion.The Company’s other non-current liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets consist primarily of deferred tax liabilities, gross unrecognized tax benefits and the related gross interest and penalties. As of September 24, 2016, the Company had non-current deferred tax liabilities of $26.0 billion. Additionally, as of September 24, 2016, the Company had gross unrecognized tax benefits of $7.7 billion and an additional $1.0 billion for gross interest and penalties classified as non-current liabilities. At this time, the Company is unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments due to uncertainties in the timing of tax audit outcomes; therefore, such amounts are not included in the above contractual obligation table.IndemnificationThe Company generally does not indemnify end-users of its operating system and application software against legal claims that the software infringes third-party intellectual property rights. Other agreements entered into by the Company sometimes include indemnification provisions under which the Company could be subject to costs and/or damages in the event of an infringement claim against the Company or an indemnified third-party. In the opinion of management, there was not at least a reasonable possibility the Company may have incurred a material loss with respect to indemnification of end-users of its operating system or application software for infringement of third-party intellectual property rights. The Company offers an iPhone Upgrade Program, which is available to customers who purchase a qualifying iPhone in the U.S., the U.K. and mainland China. The iPhone Upgrade Program provides customers the right to trade in that iPhone for a specified amount when purchasing a new iPhone, provided certain conditions are met. The Company accounts for the trade-in right as a guarantee liability and recognizes arrangement revenue net of the fair value of such right with subsequent changes to the guarantee liability recognized within revenue.The Company has entered into indemnification agreements with its directors and executive officers. Under these agreements, the Company has agreed to indemnify such individuals to the fullest extent permitted by law against liabilities that arise by reason of their status as directors or officers and to advance expenses incurred by such individuals in connection with related legal proceedings. It is not possible to determine the maximum potential amount of payments the Company could be required to make under these agreements due to the limited history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each claim. However, the Company maintains directors and officers liability insurance coverage to reduce its exposure to such obligations.Critical Accounting Policies and EstimatesThe preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) and the Company’s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and operating results require the Company’s management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported in its consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Note 1, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Company’s consolidated financial statements. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. Actual results may differ from these estimates, and such differences may be material.Management believes the Company’s critical accounting policies and estimates are those related to revenue recognition, valuation and impairment of marketable securities, inventory valuation, valuation of manufacturing-related assets and estimation of purchase commitment cancellation fees, warranty costs, income taxes, and legal and other contingencies. Management considers these policies critical because they are both important to the portrayal of the Company’s financial condition and operating results, and they require management to make judgments and estimates about inherently uncertain matters. The Company’s senior management has reviewed these critical accounting policies and related disclosures with the Audit and Finance Committee of the Company’s Board of Directors.Apple Inc. | 2016 Form 10-K | 32



Revenue RecognitionNet sales consist primarily of revenue from the sale of hardware, software, digital content and applications, accessories, and service and support contracts. The Company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the sales price is fixed or determinable and collection is probable. Product is considered delivered to the customer once it has been shipped and title, risk of loss and rewards of ownership have been transferred. For most of the Company’s product sales, these criteria are met at the time the product is shipped. For online sales to individuals, for some sales to education customers in the U.S., and for certain other sales, the Company defers revenue until the customer receives the product because the Company retains a portion of the risk of loss on these sales during transit. For payment terms in excess of the Company’s standard payment terms, revenue is recognized as payments become due unless the Company has positive evidence that the sales price is fixed or determinable, such as a successful history of collection, without concession, on comparable arrangements. The Company recognizes revenue from the sale of hardware products, software bundled with hardware that is essential to the functionality of the hardware and third-party digital content sold on the iTunes Store in accordance with general revenue recognition accounting guidance. The Company recognizes revenue in accordance with industry-specific software accounting guidance for the following types of sales transactions: (i) standalone sales of software products, (ii) sales of software upgrades and (iii) sales of software bundled with hardware not essential to the functionality of the hardware.For multi-element arrangements that include hardware products containing software essential to the hardware product’s functionality, undelivered software elements that relate to the hardware product’s essential software and/or undelivered non-software services, the Company allocates revenue to all deliverables based on their relative selling prices. In such circumstances, the Company uses a hierarchy to determine the selling price to be used for allocating revenue to deliverables: (i) vendor-specific objective evidence of fair value (“VSOE”), (ii) third-party evidence of selling price (“TPE”) and (iii) best estimate of selling price (“ESP”). VSOE generally exists only when the Company sells the deliverable separately and is the price actually charged by the Company for that deliverable. ESPs reflect the Company’s best estimates of what the selling prices of elements would be if they were sold regularly on a stand-alone basis.For sales of qualifying versions of iOS devices, Mac, Apple Watch and Apple TV, the Company has indicated it may from time to time provide future unspecified software upgrades to the device’s essential software and/or non-software services free of charge. Because the Company has neither VSOE nor TPE for the unspecified software upgrade rights or the non-software services, revenue is allocated to these rights and services based on the Company’s ESPs. Revenue allocated to the unspecified software upgrade rights and non-software services based on the Company’s ESPs is deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis over the estimated period the software upgrades and non-software services are expected to be provided.The Company’s process for determining ESPs involves management’s judgment and considers multiple factors that may vary over time depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each deliverable. Should future facts and circumstances change, the Company’s ESPs and the future rate of related amortization for unspecified software upgrades and non-software services related to future sales of these devices could change. Factors subject to change include the unspecified software upgrade rights and non-software services offered, the estimated value of unspecified software upgrade rights and non-software services and the estimated period unspecified software upgrades and non-software services are expected to be provided.The Company records reductions to revenue for estimated commitments related to price protection and other customer incentive programs. For transactions involving price protection, the Company recognizes revenue net of the estimated amount to be refunded, provided the refund amount can be reasonably and reliably estimated and the other conditions for revenue recognition have been met. The Company’s policy requires that, if refunds cannot be reliably estimated, revenue is not recognized until reliable estimates can be made or the price protection lapses. For the Company’s other customer incentive programs, the estimated cost is recognized at the later of the date at which the Company has sold the product or the date at which the program is offered. The Company also records reductions to revenue for expected future product returns based on the Company’s historical experience. Future market conditions and product transitions may require the Company to increase customer incentive programs that could result in reductions to future revenue. Additionally, certain customer incentive programs require management to estimate the number of customers who will actually redeem the incentive. Management’s estimates are based on historical experience and the specific terms and conditions of particular incentive programs. If a greater than estimated proportion of customers redeems such incentives, the Company would be required to record additional reductions to revenue, which would have an adverse impact on the Company’s operating results.Apple Inc. | 2016 Form 10-K | 33



Valuation and Impairment of Marketable SecuritiesThe Company’s investments in available-for-sale securities are reported at fair value. Unrealized gains and losses related to changes in the fair value of securities are recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income, net of tax, in the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets. Changes in the fair value of available-for-sale securities impact the Company’s net income only when such securities are sold or an other-than-temporary impairment is recognized. Realized gains and losses on the sale of securities are determined by specific identification of each security’s cost basis. The Company regularly reviews its investment portfolio to determine if any security is other-than-temporarily impaired, which would require the Company to record an impairment charge in the period any such determination is made. In making this determination, the Company evaluates, among other things, the duration and extent to which the fair value of a security is less than its cost; the financial condition of the issuer and any changes thereto; and the Company’s intent to sell, or whether it will more likely than not be required to sell, the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis. The Company’s assessment of whether a security is other-than-temporarily impaired could change in the future due to new developments or changes in assumptions related to any particular security, which would have an adverse impact on the Company’s operating results.Inventory Valuation, Valuation of Manufacturing-Related Assets and Estimation of Purchase Commitment Cancellation FeesThe Company must purchase components and build inventory in advance of product shipments and has invested in manufacturing-related assets, including capital assets held at its suppliers’ facilities. In addition, the Company has made prepayments to certain of its suppliers associated with long-term supply agreements to secure supply of inventory components. The Company records a write-down for inventories of components and products, including third-party products held for resale, which have become obsolete or are in excess of anticipated demand or net realizable value. The Company performs a detailed review of inventory that considers multiple factors including demand forecasts, product life cycle status, product development plans, current sales levels and component cost trends. The Company also reviews its manufacturing-related capital assets and inventory prepayments for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. If the Company determines that an asset is not recoverable, it records an impairment loss equal to the amount by which the carrying value of such an asset exceeds its fair value.The industries in which the Company competes are subject to a rapid and unpredictable pace of product and component obsolescence and demand changes. In certain circumstances the Company may be required to record additional write-downs of inventory and/or impairments of manufacturing-related assets or inventory prepayments. These circumstances include future demand or market conditions for the Company’s products being less favorable than forecasted, unforeseen technological changes or changes to the Company’s product development plans that negatively impact the utility of any of these assets, or significant deterioration in the financial condition of one or more of the Company’s suppliers that hold any of the Company’s manufacturing-related assets or to whom the Company has made an inventory prepayment. Such write-downs would adversely affect the Company’s financial condition and operating results in the period when the additional write-downs were recorded.The Company accrues for estimated purchase commitment cancellation fees related to inventory orders that have been cancelled or are expected to be cancelled. Consistent with industry practice, the Company acquires components through a combination of purchase orders, supplier contracts, and open orders in each case based on projected demand. Manufacturing purchase obligations typically cover the Company’s forecasted component and manufacturing requirements for periods up to 150 days. If there is an abrupt and substantial decline in demand for one or more of the Company’s products, a change in the Company’s product development plans, or an unanticipated change in technological requirements for any of the Company’s products, the Company may be required to record additional accruals for cancellation fees that would adversely affect its results of operations in the period when the cancellation fees were identified and recorded.Warranty CostsThe Company accrues for the estimated cost of warranties in the period the related revenue is recognized based on historical and projected warranty claim rates, historical and projected cost-per-claim and knowledge of specific product failures that are outside of the Company’s typical experience. The Company regularly reviews these estimates and the current installed base of products subject to warranty protection to assess the appropriateness of its recorded warranty liabilities and adjusts the amounts as necessary. If actual product failure rates or repair costs differ from estimates, revisions to the estimated warranty liabilities would be required and could materially affect the Company’s financial condition and operating results.Apple Inc. | 2016 Form 10-K | 34



Income TaxesThe Company records a tax provision for the anticipated tax consequences of its reported operating results. The provision for income taxes is computed using the asset and liability method, under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in effect for the years in which those tax assets and liabilities are expected to be realized or settled. The Company records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is believed more likely than not to be realized.The Company recognizes tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement.Management believes it is more likely than not that forecasted income, including income that may be generated as a result of certain tax planning strategies, together with future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, will be sufficient to fully recover the deferred tax assets. In the event that the Company determines all or part of the net deferred tax assets are not realizable in the future, the Company will record an adjustment to the valuation allowance that would be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made. In addition, the calculation of tax liabilities involves significant judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of GAAP and complex tax laws. Resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with management’s expectations could have a material impact on the Company’s financial condition and operating results.Legal and Other ContingenciesAs discussed in Part I, Item 3 of this Form 10-K under the heading “Legal Proceedings” and in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Note 10, “Commitments and Contingencies,” the Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business. The Company records a liability when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable, the determination of which requires significant judgment. In the opinion of management, there was not at least a reasonable possibility the Company may have incurred a material loss, or a material loss in excess of a recorded accrual, with respect to loss contingencies for asserted legal and other claims. However, the outcome of legal proceedings and claims brought against the Company is subject to significant uncertainty. Therefore, although management considers the likelihood of such an outcome to be remote, if one or more of these legal matters were resolved against the Company in a reporting period for amounts in excess of management’s expectations, the Company’s consolidated financial statements for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected.Apple Inc. | 2016 Form 10-K | 35


## Item 7A


To provide a meaningful assessment of the foreign currency risk associated with certain of the Company’s foreign currency derivative positions, the Company performed a sensitivity analysis using a value-at-risk (“VAR”) model to assess the potential impact of fluctuations in exchange rates. The VAR model consisted of using a Monte Carlo simulation to generate thousands of random market price paths assuming normal market conditions. The VAR is the maximum expected loss in fair value, for a given confidence interval, to the Company’s foreign currency derivative positions due to adverse movements in rates. The VAR model is not intended to represent actual losses but is used as a risk estimation and management tool. The model assumes normal market conditions. Forecasted transactions, firm commitments and assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies were excluded from the model. Based on the results of the model, the Company estimates with 95% confidence, a maximum one-day loss in fair value of $434 million as of September 24, 2016 compared to a maximum one-day loss in fair value of $342 million as of September 26, 2015. Because the Company uses foreign currency instruments for hedging purposes, the loss in fair value incurred on those instruments are generally offset by increases in the fair value of the underlying exposures.Actual future gains and losses associated with the Company’s investment portfolio and derivative positions may differ materially from the sensitivity analyses performed as of September 24, 2016 due to the inherent limitations associated with predicting the timing and amount of changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchanges rates and the Company’s actual exposures and positions.Apple Inc. | 2016 Form 10-K | 37

Notes to Consolidated Financial StatementsNote 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting PoliciesApple Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries (collectively “Apple” or the “Company”) designs, manufactures and markets mobile communication and media devices, personal computers and portable digital music players, and sells a variety of related software, services, accessories, networking solutions and third-party digital content and applications. The Company sells its products worldwide through its retail stores, online stores and direct sales force, as well as through third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers and value-added resellers. In addition, the Company sells a variety of third-party Apple-compatible products, including application software and various accessories through its retail and online stores. The Company sells to consumers, small and mid-sized businesses and education, enterprise and government customers.Basis of Presentation and PreparationThe accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company. Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. In the opinion of the Company’s management, the consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments, which are normal and recurring in nature, necessary for fair financial statement presentation. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in these consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates. Certain prior period amounts in the consolidated financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the current period’s presentation.The Company’s fiscal year is the 52 or 53-week period that ends on the last Saturday of September. The Company’s fiscal years 2016, 2015 and 2014 ended on September 24, 2016, September 26, 2015 and September 27, 2014, respectively, and each spanned 52 weeks. An additional week is included in the first fiscal quarter approximately every five or six years to realign fiscal quarters with calendar quarters, which will next occur in the first quarter of the Company's fiscal year ending September 30, 2017. Unless otherwise stated, references to particular years, quarters, months and periods refer to the Company’s fiscal years ended in September and the associated quarters, months and periods of those fiscal years.During 2016, the Company adopted an accounting standard that simplified the presentation of deferred income taxes by requiring deferred tax assets and liabilities be classified as noncurrent in a classified statement of financial position. The Company has adopted this accounting standard prospectively; accordingly, the prior period amounts in the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets within this Annual Report on Form 10-K were not adjusted to conform to the new accounting standard. The adoption of this accounting standard was not material to the Company’s consolidated financial statements.Revenue RecognitionNet sales consist primarily of revenue from the sale of hardware, software, digital content and applications, accessories, and service and support contracts. The Company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the sales price is fixed or determinable and collection is probable. Product is considered delivered to the customer once it has been shipped and title, risk of loss and rewards of ownership have been transferred. For most of the Company’s product sales, these criteria are met at the time the product is shipped. For online sales to individuals, for some sales to education customers in the U.S., and for certain other sales, the Company defers revenue until the customer receives the product because the Company retains a portion of the risk of loss on these sales during transit. For payment terms in excess of the Company’s standard payment terms, revenue is recognized as payments become due unless the Company has positive evidence that the sales price is fixed or determinable, such as a successful history of collection, without concession, on comparable arrangements. The Company recognizes revenue from the sale of hardware products, software bundled with hardware that is essential to the functionality of the hardware and third-party digital content sold on the iTunes Store in accordance with general revenue recognition accounting guidance. The Company recognizes revenue in accordance with industry specific software accounting guidance for the following types of sales transactions: (i) standalone sales of software products, (ii) sales of software upgrades and (iii) sales of software bundled with hardware not essential to the functionality of the hardware.For the sale of most third-party products, the Company recognizes revenue based on the gross amount billed to customers because the Company establishes its own pricing for such products, retains related inventory risk for physical products, is the primary obligor to the customer and assumes the credit risk for amounts billed to its customers. For third-party applications sold through the App Store and Mac App Store and certain digital content sold through the iTunes Store, the Company does not determine the selling price of the products and is not the primary obligor to the customer. Therefore, the Company accounts for such sales on a net basis by recognizing in net sales only the commission it retains from each sale. The portion of the gross amount billed to customers that is remitted by the Company to third-party app developers and certain digital content owners is not reflected in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Operations.Apple Inc. | 2016 Form 10-K | 44



The Company records deferred revenue when it receives payments in advance of the delivery of products or the performance of services. This includes amounts that have been deferred for unspecified and specified software upgrade rights and non-software services that are attached to hardware and software products. The Company sells gift cards redeemable at its retail and online stores, and also sells gift cards redeemable on iTunes Store, App Store, Mac App Store, TV App Store and iBooks Store for the purchase of digital content and software. The Company records deferred revenue upon the sale of the card, which is relieved upon redemption of the card by the customer. Revenue from AppleCare service and support contracts is deferred and recognized over the service coverage periods. AppleCare service and support contracts typically include extended phone support, repair services, web-based support resources and diagnostic tools offered under the Company’s standard limited warranty.The Company records reductions to revenue for estimated commitments related to price protection and other customer incentive programs. For transactions involving price protection, the Company recognizes revenue net of the estimated amount to be refunded. For the Company’s other customer incentive programs, the estimated cost of these programs is recognized at the later of the date at which the Company has sold the product or the date at which the program is offered. The Company also records reductions to revenue for expected future product returns based on the Company’s historical experience. Revenue is recorded net of taxes collected from customers that are remitted to governmental authorities, with the collected taxes recorded as current liabilities until remitted to the relevant government authority.Revenue Recognition for Arrangements with Multiple DeliverablesFor multi-element arrangements that include hardware products containing software essential to the hardware product’s functionality, undelivered software elements that relate to the hardware product’s essential software, and undelivered non-software services, the Company allocates revenue to all deliverables based on their relative selling prices. In such circumstances, the Company uses a hierarchy to determine the selling price to be used for allocating revenue to deliverables: (i) vendor-specific objective evidence of fair value (“VSOE”), (ii) third-party evidence of selling price (“TPE”) and (iii) best estimate of selling price (“ESP”). VSOE generally exists only when the Company sells the deliverable separately and is the price actually charged by the Company for that deliverable. ESPs reflect the Company’s best estimates of what the selling prices of elements would be if they were sold regularly on a stand-alone basis. For multi-element arrangements accounted for in accordance with industry specific software accounting guidance, the Company allocates revenue to all deliverables based on the VSOE of each element, and if VSOE does not exist revenue is recognized when elements lacking VSOE are delivered.For sales of qualifying versions of iPhone, iPad, iPod touch, Mac, Apple Watch and Apple TV, the Company has indicated it may from time to time provide future unspecified software upgrades to the device’s essential software and/or non-software services free of charge. The Company has identified up to three deliverables regularly included in arrangements involving the sale of these devices. The first deliverable, which represents the substantial portion of the allocated sales price, is the hardware and software essential to the functionality of the hardware device delivered at the time of sale. The second deliverable is the embedded right included with qualifying devices to receive on a when-and-if-available basis, future unspecified software upgrades relating to the product’s essential software. The third deliverable is the non-software services to be provided to qualifying devices. The Company allocates revenue between these deliverables using the relative selling price method. Because the Company has neither VSOE nor TPE for these deliverables, the allocation of revenue is based on the Company’s ESPs. Revenue allocated to the delivered hardware and the related essential software is recognized at the time of sale provided the other conditions for revenue recognition have been met. Revenue allocated to the embedded unspecified software upgrade rights and the non-software services is deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis over the estimated period the software upgrades and non-software services are expected to be provided. Cost of sales related to delivered hardware and related essential software, including estimated warranty costs, are recognized at the time of sale. Costs incurred to provide non-software services are recognized as cost of sales as incurred, and engineering and sales and marketing costs are recognized as operating expenses as incurred.The Company’s process for determining its ESP for deliverables without VSOE or TPE considers multiple factors that may vary depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each deliverable including, where applicable, prices charged by the Company and market trends in the pricing for similar offerings, product specific business objectives, length of time a particular version of a device has been available, estimated cost to provide the non-software services and the relative ESP of the upgrade rights and non-software services as compared to the total selling price of the product.Shipping CostsAmounts billed to customers related to shipping and handling are classified as revenue, and the Company’s shipping and handling costs are classified as cost of sales.Warranty CostsThe Company generally provides for the estimated cost of hardware and software warranties in the period the related revenue is recognized. The Company assesses the adequacy of its accrued warranty liabilities and adjusts the amounts as necessary based on actual experience and changes in future estimates.Apple Inc. | 2016 Form 10-K | 45



Software Development CostsResearch and development (“R&D”) costs are expensed as incurred. Development costs of computer software to be sold, leased, or otherwise marketed are subject to capitalization beginning when a product’s technological feasibility has been established and ending when a product is available for general release to customers. In most instances, the Company’s products are released soon after technological feasibility has been established and as a result software development costs were expensed as incurred.Advertising CostsAdvertising costs are expensed as incurred and included in selling, general and administrative expenses. Share-based CompensationThe Company recognizes expense related to share-based payment transactions in which it receives employee services in exchange for (a) equity instruments of the Company or (b) liabilities that are based on the fair value of the Company’s equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of such equity instruments. Share-based compensation cost for restricted stock and restricted stock units (“RSUs”) is measured based on the closing fair market value of the Company’s common stock on the date of grant. The Company recognizes share-based compensation cost over the award’s requisite service period on a straight-line basis for time-based RSUs and on a graded basis for RSUs that are contingent on the achievement of performance conditions. The Company recognizes a benefit from share-based compensation in the Consolidated Statements of Shareholders’ Equity if an excess tax benefit is realized. In addition, the Company recognizes the indirect effects of share-based compensation on R&D tax credits, foreign tax credits and domestic manufacturing deductions in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Further information regarding share-based compensation can be found in Note 9, “Benefit Plans.”Income TaxesThe provision for income taxes is computed using the asset and liability method, under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in effect for the years in which those tax assets and liabilities are expected to be realized or settled. The Company records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is believed more likely than not to be realized.The Company recognizes the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon settlement. See Note 5, “Income Taxes” for additional information.Earnings Per ShareBasic earnings per share is computed by dividing income available to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share is computed by dividing income available to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period increased to include the number of additional shares of common stock that would have been outstanding if the potentially dilutive securities had been issued. Potentially dilutive securities include outstanding stock options, shares to be purchased by employees under the Company’s employee stock purchase plan, unvested restricted stock and unvested RSUs. The dilutive effect of potentially dilutive securities is reflected in diluted earnings per share by application of the treasury stock method. Under the treasury stock method, an increase in the fair market value of the Company’s common stock can result in a greater dilutive effect from potentially dilutive securities.Apple Inc. | 2016 Form 10-K | 46

The following table shows the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share for 2016, 2015 and 2014 (net income in millions and shares in thousands):Potentially dilutive securities whose effect would have been antidilutive are excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share.Financial InstrumentsCash Equivalents and Marketable SecuritiesAll highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase are classified as cash equivalents. The Company’s marketable debt and equity securities have been classified and accounted for as available-for-sale. Management determines the appropriate classification of its investments at the time of purchase and reevaluates the classifications at each balance sheet date. The Company classifies its marketable debt securities as either short-term or long-term based on each instrument’s underlying contractual maturity date. Marketable debt securities with maturities of 12 months or less are classified as short-term and marketable debt securities with maturities greater than 12 months are classified as long-term. Marketable equity securities, including mutual funds, are classified as either short-term or long-term based on the nature of each security and its availability for use in current operations. The Company’s marketable debt and equity securities are carried at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses, net of taxes, reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (“AOCI”) in shareholders’ equity, with the exception of unrealized losses believed to be other-than-temporary which are reported in earnings in the current period. The cost of securities sold is based upon the specific identification method.Derivative Financial InstrumentsThe Company accounts for its derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities and carries them at fair value.For derivative instruments that hedge the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows that are designated as cash flow hedges, the effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative instrument is reported as a component of AOCI in shareholders’ equity and reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. The ineffective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative instrument, if any, is recognized in earnings in the current period. To receive hedge accounting treatment, cash flow hedges must be highly effective in offsetting changes to expected future cash flows on hedged transactions. For options designated as cash flow hedges, changes in the time value are excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and are recognized in earnings.For derivative instruments that hedge the exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset or a liability and that are designated as fair value hedges, both the net gain or loss on the derivative instrument as well as the offsetting gain or loss on the hedged item are recognized in earnings in the current period.For derivative instruments and foreign currency debt that hedge the exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates used for translation of the net investment in a foreign operation and that are designated as a net investment hedge, the net gain or loss on the effective portion of the derivative instrument is reported in the same manner as a foreign currency translation adjustment. For forward exchange contracts designated as net investment hedges, the Company excludes changes in fair value relating to changes in the forward carry component from its definition of effectiveness. Accordingly, any gains or losses related to this forward carry component are recognized in earnings in the current period. Derivatives that do not qualify as hedges are adjusted to fair value through earnings in the current period.Apple Inc. | 2016 Form 10-K | 47



Allowance for Doubtful AccountsThe Company records its allowance for doubtful accounts based upon its assessment of various factors, including historical experience, age of the accounts receivable balances, credit quality of the Company’s customers, current economic conditions and other factors that may affect the customers’ abilities to pay.InventoriesInventories are stated at the lower of cost, computed using the first-in, first-out method and net realizable value. Any adjustments to reduce the cost of inventories to their net realizable value are recognized in earnings in the current period. As of September 24, 2016 and September 26, 2015, the Company’s inventories consist primarily of finished goods.Property, Plant and EquipmentProperty, plant and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation is computed by use of the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which for buildings is the lesser of 30 years or the remaining life of the underlying building; between one to five years for machinery and equipment, including product tooling and manufacturing process equipment; and the shorter of lease terms or useful life for leasehold improvements. The Company capitalizes eligible costs to acquire or develop internal-use software that are incurred subsequent to the preliminary project stage. Capitalized costs related to internal-use software are amortized using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which range from three to five years. Depreciation and amortization expense on property and equipment was $8.3 billion, $9.2 billion and $6.9 billion during 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.Long-Lived Assets Including Goodwill and Other Acquired Intangible AssetsThe Company reviews property, plant and equipment, inventory component prepayments and identifiable intangibles, excluding goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives, for impairment. Long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of these assets is measured by comparison of their carrying amounts to future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate. If property, plant and equipment, inventory component prepayments and certain identifiable intangibles are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized equals the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds its fair value.The Company does not amortize goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives, rather such assets are required to be tested for impairment at least annually or sooner whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the assets may be impaired. The Company performs its goodwill and intangible asset impairment tests in the fourth quarter of each year. The Company did not recognize any impairment charges related to goodwill or indefinite lived intangible assets during 2016, 2015 and 2014. For purposes of testing goodwill for impairment, the Company established reporting units based on its current reporting structure. Goodwill has been allocated to these reporting units to the extent it relates to each reporting unit. In 2016 and 2015, the Company’s goodwill was primarily allocated to the Americas and Europe reporting units.The Company amortizes its intangible assets with definite useful lives over their estimated useful lives and reviews these assets for impairment. The Company typically amortizes its acquired intangible assets with definite useful lives over periods from three to seven years.Fair Value MeasurementsThe Company applies fair value accounting for all financial assets and liabilities and non-financial assets and liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis. The Company defines fair value as the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. When determining the fair value measurements for assets and liabilities, which are required to be recorded at fair value, the Company considers the principal or most advantageous market in which the Company would transact and the market-based risk measurements or assumptions that market participants would use to price the asset or liability, such as risks inherent in valuation techniques, transfer restrictions and credit risk. Fair value is estimated by applying the following hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value into three levels and bases the categorization within the hierarchy upon the lowest level of input that is available and significant to the fair value measurement:Level 1 – Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.Level 2 – Observable inputs other than quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in inactive markets, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.Level 3 – Inputs that are generally unobservable and typically reflect management’s estimate of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability.Apple Inc. | 2016 Form 10-K | 48

The Company’s valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of money market funds and certain marketable equity securities were derived from quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. The valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of the Company’s debt instruments and all other financial instruments, all of which have counterparties with high credit ratings, were valued based on quoted market prices or model-driven valuations using significant inputs derived from or corroborated by observable market data.In accordance with the fair value accounting requirements, companies may choose to measure eligible financial instruments and certain other items at fair value. The Company has not elected the fair value option for any eligible financial instruments.Foreign Currency Translation and RemeasurementThe Company translates the assets and liabilities of its non-U.S. dollar functional currency subsidiaries into U.S. dollars using exchange rates in effect at the end of each period. Revenue and expenses for these subsidiaries are translated using rates that approximate those in effect during the period. Gains and losses from these translations are recognized in foreign currency translation included in AOCI in shareholders’ equity. The Company’s subsidiaries that use the U.S. dollar as their functional currency remeasure monetary assets and liabilities at exchange rates in effect at the end of each period, and inventories, property and nonmonetary assets and liabilities at historical rates.Note 2 – Financial InstrumentsCash, Cash Equivalents and Marketable SecuritiesThe following tables show the Company’s cash and available-for-sale securities’ adjusted cost, gross unrealized gains, gross unrealized losses and fair value by significant investment category recorded as cash and cash equivalents or short- or long-term marketable securities as of September 24, 2016 and September 26, 2015 (in millions): Apple Inc. | 2016 Form 10-K | 49

The Company may sell certain of its marketable securities prior to their stated maturities for strategic reasons including, but not limited to, anticipation of credit deterioration and duration management. The maturities of the Company’s long-term marketable securities generally range from one to five years.The Company considers the declines in market value of its marketable securities investment portfolio to be temporary in nature. The Company typically invests in highly-rated securities, and its investment policy generally limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. The policy generally requires investments to be investment grade, with the primary objective of minimizing the potential risk of principal loss. Fair values were determined for each individual security in the investment portfolio. When evaluating an investment for other-than-temporary impairment the Company reviews factors such as the length of time and extent to which fair value has been below its cost basis, the financial condition of the issuer and any changes thereto, changes in market interest rates and the Company’s intent to sell, or whether it is more likely than not it will be required to sell the investment before recovery of the investment’s cost basis. As of September 24, 2016, the Company does not consider any of its investments to be other-than-temporarily impaired.Derivative Financial InstrumentsThe Company may use derivatives to partially offset its business exposure to foreign currency and interest rate risk on expected future cash flows, on net investments in certain foreign subsidiaries and on certain existing assets and liabilities. However, the Company may choose not to hedge certain exposures for a variety of reasons including, but not limited to, accounting considerations and the prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures. There can be no assurance the hedges will offset more than a portion of the financial impact resulting from movements in foreign currency exchange or interest rates.To help protect gross margins from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, certain of the Company’s subsidiaries whose functional currency is the U.S. dollar may hedge a portion of forecasted foreign currency revenue, and subsidiaries whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar and who sell in local currencies may hedge a portion of forecasted inventory purchases not denominated in the subsidiaries’ functional currencies. The Company may enter into forward contracts, option contracts or other instruments to manage this risk and may designate these instruments as cash flow hedges. The Company typically hedges portions of its forecasted foreign currency exposure associated with revenue and inventory purchases, typically for up to 12 months.Apple Inc. | 2016 Form 10-K | 50

To help protect the net investment in a foreign operation from adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates, the Company may enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts to offset the changes in the carrying amounts of these investments due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. In addition, the Company may use non-derivative financial instruments, such as its foreign currency-denominated debt, as economic hedges of its net investments in certain foreign subsidiaries. In both of these cases, the Company designates these instruments as net investment hedges.The Company may also enter into non-designated foreign currency contracts to partially offset the foreign currency exchange gains and losses generated by the re-measurement of certain assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies.The Company may enter into interest rate swaps, options, or other instruments to manage interest rate risk. These instruments may offset a portion of changes in income or expense, or changes in fair value of the Company’s term debt or investments. The Company designates these instruments as either cash flow or fair value hedges. The Company’s hedged interest rate transactions as of September 24, 2016 are expected to be recognized within 10 years.Cash Flow HedgesThe effective portions of cash flow hedges are recorded in AOCI until the hedged item is recognized in earnings. Deferred gains and losses associated with cash flow hedges of foreign currency revenue are recognized as a component of net sales in the same period as the related revenue is recognized, and deferred gains and losses related to cash flow hedges of inventory purchases are recognized as a component of cost of sales in the same period as the related costs are recognized. Deferred gains and losses associated with cash flow hedges of interest income or expense are recognized in other income/(expense), net in the same period as the related income or expense is recognized. The ineffective portions and amounts excluded from the effectiveness testing of cash flow hedges are recognized in other income/(expense), net.Derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges must be de-designated as hedges when it is probable the forecasted hedged transaction will not occur in the initially identified time period or within a subsequent two-month time period. Deferred gains and losses in AOCI associated with such derivative instruments are reclassified immediately into other income/(expense), net. Any subsequent changes in fair value of such derivative instruments are reflected in other income/(expense), net unless they are re-designated as hedges of other transactions.Net Investment HedgesThe effective portions of net investment hedges are recorded in other comprehensive income (“OCI”) as a part of the cumulative translation adjustment. The ineffective portions and amounts excluded from the effectiveness testing of net investment hedges are recognized in other income/(expense), net.Fair Value HedgesGains and losses related to changes in fair value hedges are recognized in earnings along with a corresponding loss or gain related to the change in value of the underlying hedged item.Non-Designated DerivativesDerivatives that are not designated as hedging instruments are adjusted to fair value through earnings in the financial statement line item to which the derivative relates.The Company records all derivatives in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value. The Company’s accounting treatment for these derivative instruments is based on its hedge designation.

The following table shows the notional amounts of the Company’s outstanding derivative instruments and credit risk amounts associated with outstanding or unsettled derivative instruments as of September 24, 2016 and September 26, 2015 (in millions):The notional amounts for outstanding derivative instruments provide one measure of the transaction volume outstanding and do not represent the amount of the Company’s exposure to credit or market loss. The credit risk amounts represent the Company’s gross exposure to potential accounting loss on derivative instruments that are outstanding or unsettled if all counterparties failed to perform according to the terms of the contract, based on then-current currency or interest rates at each respective date. The Company’s exposure to credit loss and market risk will vary over time as currency and interest rates change. Although the table above reflects the notional and credit risk amounts of the Company’s derivative instruments, it does not reflect the gains or losses associated with the exposures and transactions that the instruments are intended to hedge. The amounts ultimately realized upon settlement of these financial instruments, together with the gains and losses on the underlying exposures, will depend on actual market conditions during the remaining life of the instruments.The Company generally enters into master netting arrangements, which are designed to reduce credit risk by permitting net settlement of transactions with the same counterparty. To further limit credit risk, the Company generally enters into collateral security arrangements that provide for collateral to be received or posted when the net fair value of certain financial instruments fluctuates from contractually established thresholds. The Company presents its derivative assets and derivative liabilities at their gross fair values in its Consolidated Balance Sheets.  The net cash collateral received by the Company related to derivative instruments under its collateral security arrangements was $163 million as of September 24, 2016 and $1.0 billion as of September 26, 2015, which were recorded as accrued expenses in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.Under master netting arrangements with the respective counterparties to the Company’s derivative contracts, the Company is allowed to net settle transactions with a single net amount payable by one party to the other. As of September 24, 2016 and September 26, 2015, the potential effects of these rights of set-off associated with the Company’s derivative contracts, including the effects of collateral, would be a reduction to both derivative assets and derivative liabilities of $1.5 billion and $2.2 billion, respectively, resulting in a net derivative asset of $160 million and a net derivative liability of $78 million, respectively.Accounts ReceivableTrade ReceivablesThe Company has considerable trade receivables outstanding with its third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers, value-added resellers, small and mid-sized businesses and education, enterprise and government customers. The Company generally does not require collateral from its customers; however, the Company will require collateral in certain instances to limit credit risk. In addition, when possible, the Company attempts to limit credit risk on trade receivables with credit insurance for certain customers or by requiring third-party financing, loans or leases to support credit exposure. These credit-financing arrangements are directly between the third-party financing company and the end customer. As such, the Company generally does not assume any recourse or credit risk sharing related to any of these arrangements.As of September 24, 2016 and September 26, 2015, the Company had one customer that represented 10% or more of total trade receivables, which accounted for 10% and 12%, respectively. The Company’s cellular network carriers accounted for 63% and 71% of trade receivables as of September 24, 2016 and September 26, 2015, respectively.Vendor Non-Trade ReceivablesThe Company has non-trade receivables from certain of its manufacturing vendors resulting from the sale of components to these vendors who manufacture sub-assemblies or assemble final products for the Company. The Company purchases these components directly from suppliers. Vendor non-trade receivables from two of the Company’s vendors accounted for 47% and 21% of total vendor non-trade receivables as of September 24, 2016 and three of the Company’s vendors accounted for 38%, 18% and 14% of total vendor non-trade receivables as of September 26, 2015.Apple Inc. | 2016 Form 10-K | 53

Amortization expense related to acquired intangible assets was $1.5 billion, $1.3 billion and $1.1 billion in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. As of September 24, 2016, the remaining weighted-average amortization period for acquired intangible assets is 3.4 years. The expected annual amortization expense related to acquired intangible assets as of September 24, 2016, is as follows (in millions):Note 5 – Income TaxesThe provision for income taxes for 2016, 2015 and 2014, consisted of the following (in millions):The foreign provision for income taxes is based on foreign pre-tax earnings of $41.1 billion, $47.6 billion and $33.6 billion in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The Company’s consolidated financial statements provide for any related tax liability on undistributed earnings that the Company does not intend to be indefinitely reinvested outside the U.S. Substantially all of the Company’s undistributed international earnings intended to be indefinitely reinvested in operations outside the U.S. were generated by subsidiaries organized in Ireland, which has a statutory tax rate of 12.5%. As of September 24, 2016, U.S. income taxes have not been provided on a cumulative total of $109.8 billion of such earnings. The amount of unrecognized deferred tax liability related to these temporary differences is estimated to be $35.9 billion.As of September 24, 2016 and September 26, 2015, $216.0 billion and $186.9 billion, respectively, of the Company’s cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities were held by foreign subsidiaries and are generally based in U.S. dollar-denominated holdings. Amounts held by foreign subsidiaries are generally subject to U.S. income taxation on repatriation to the U.S.Apple Inc. | 2016 Form 10-K | 55

A reconciliation of the provision for income taxes, with the amount computed by applying the statutory federal income tax rate (35% in 2016, 2015 and 2014) to income before provision for income taxes for 2016, 2015 and 2014, is as follows (dollars in millions): The Company’s income taxes payable have been reduced by the tax benefits from employee stock plan awards. For RSUs, the Company receives an income tax benefit upon the award’s vesting equal to the tax effect of the underlying stock’s fair market value. The Company had net excess tax benefits from equity awards of $379 million, $748 million and $706 million in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, which were reflected as increases to common stock.As of September 24, 2016 and September 26, 2015, the significant components of the Company’s deferred tax assets and liabilities were (in millions):Deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect the effects of tax losses, credits and the future income tax effects of temporary differences between the consolidated financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and are measured using enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.Uncertain Tax PositionsTax positions are evaluated in a two-step process. The Company first determines whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination. If a tax position meets the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold it is then measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements. The tax position is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. The Company classifies gross interest and penalties and unrecognized tax benefits that are not expected to result in payment or receipt of cash within one year as non-current liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.As of September 24, 2016, the total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits was $7.7 billion, of which $2.8 billion, if recognized, would affect the Company’s effective tax rate.  As of September 26, 2015, the total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits was $6.9 billion, of which $2.5 billion, if recognized, would affect the Company’s effective tax rate.

The aggregate changes in the balance of gross unrecognized tax benefits, which excludes interest and penalties, for 2016, 2015 and 2014, is as follows (in millions):The Company includes interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within the provision for income taxes. As of September 24, 2016 and September 26, 2015, the total amount of gross interest and penalties accrued was $1.0 billion and $1.3 billion, respectively, which is classified as non-current liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. In connection with tax matters, the Company recognized interest and penalty expense in 2016, 2015 and 2014 of $295 million, $709 million and $40 million, respectively.The Company is subject to taxation and files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and in many state and foreign jurisdictions. During the fourth quarter of 2016, the Company reached a partial settlement with the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”) on its examination of the years 2010 through 2012. In connection with this settlement, the Company recognized a tax benefit in the fourth quarter of 2016 that was not significant to its consolidated financial statements. All years prior to 2013 are closed, except for the years 2010 through 2012 relating to R&D tax credits. In addition, the Company is subject to audits by state, local and foreign tax authorities. In major states and major foreign jurisdictions, the years subsequent to 2003 generally remain open and could be subject to examination by the taxing authorities.The Company believes that an adequate provision has been made for any adjustments that may result from tax examinations. However, the outcome of tax audits cannot be predicted with certainty. If any issues addressed in the Company’s tax audits are resolved in a manner not consistent with its expectations, the Company could be required to adjust its provision for income taxes in the period such resolution occurs. Although timing of the resolution and/or closure of audits is not certain, the Company believes it is reasonably possible that its gross unrecognized tax benefits could decrease (whether by payment, release or a combination of both) in the next 12 months by up to $850 million.On August 30, 2016, the European Commission announced its decision that Ireland granted state aid to the Company by providing tax opinions in 1991 and 2007 concerning the tax allocation of profits of the Irish branches of two subsidiaries of the Company (the "State Aid Decision"). The State Aid Decision orders Ireland to calculate and recover additional taxes from the Company for the period June 2003 through September 2014. Irish legislative changes, effective as of the beginning of 2015, eliminated the application of the tax opinions from that date forward. The Company believes the State Aid Decision to be without merit and intends to appeal to the General Court of the Court of Justice of the European Union. Ireland has also announced its intention to appeal the State Aid Decision. While the European Commission announced a recovery amount of up to €13 billion, plus interest, the actual amount of additional taxes subject to recovery is to be calculated by Ireland in accordance with the European Commission's guidance. Once the recovery amount is computed by Ireland, the Company anticipates funding it, including interest, out of foreign cash into escrow, pending conclusion of all appeals. The Company believes that any incremental Irish corporate income taxes potentially due would be creditable against U.S. taxes. Apple Inc. | 2016 Form 10-K | 57

The Company has entered, and in the future may enter, into accelerated share repurchase arrangements (“ASRs”) with financial institutions. In exchange for up-front payments, the financial institutions deliver shares of the Company’s common stock during the purchase periods of each ASR. The total number of shares ultimately delivered, and therefore the average repurchase price paid per share, is determined at the end of the applicable purchase period of each ASR based on the volume weighted-average price of the Company’s common stock during that period. The shares received are retired in the periods they are delivered, and the up-front payments are accounted for as a reduction to shareholders’ equity in the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets in the periods the payments are made. The Company reflects the ASRs as a repurchase of common stock in the period delivered for purposes of calculating earnings per share and as forward contracts indexed to its own common stock. The ASRs met all of the applicable criteria for equity classification, and therefore were not accounted for as derivative instruments.The following table shows the Company’s ASR activity and related information during the years ended September 24, 2016 and September 26, 2015: Additionally, the Company repurchased shares of its common stock in the open market, which were retired upon repurchase, during the periods presented as follows:Note 8 – Comprehensive IncomeComprehensive income consists of two components, net income and OCI. OCI refers to revenue, expenses, and gains and losses that under GAAP are recorded as an element of shareholders’ equity but are excluded from net income. The Company’s OCI consists of foreign currency translation adjustments from those subsidiaries not using the U.S. dollar as their functional currency, net deferred gains and losses on certain derivative instruments accounted for as cash flow hedges and unrealized gains and losses on marketable securities classified as available-for-sale.Apple Inc. | 2016 Form 10-K | 61

The following table shows the pre-tax amounts reclassified from AOCI into the Consolidated Statements of Operations, and the associated financial statement line item, for 2016 and 2015 (in millions):The following table shows the changes in AOCI by component for 2016 and 2015 (in millions):Note 9 – Benefit Plans2014 Employee Stock PlanIn the second quarter of 2014, shareholders approved the 2014 Employee Stock Plan (the “2014 Plan”) and terminated the Company’s authority to grant new awards under the 2003 Employee Stock Plan (the “2003 Plan”). The 2014 Plan provides for broad-based equity grants to employees, including executive officers, and permits the granting of RSUs, stock grants, performance-based awards, stock options and stock appreciation rights, as well as cash bonus awards. RSUs granted under the 2014 Plan generally vest over four years, based on continued employment, and are settled upon vesting in shares of the Company’s common stock on a one-for-one basis. Each share issued with respect to RSUs granted under the 2014 Plan reduces the number of shares available for grant under the plan by two shares. RSUs cancelled and shares withheld to satisfy tax withholding obligations increase the number of shares available for grant under the 2014 Plan utilizing a factor of two times the number of RSUs cancelled or shares withheld. Currently, all RSUs granted under the 2014 Plan have dividend equivalent rights (“DERs”), which entitle holders of RSUs to the same dividend value per share as holders of common stock. DERs are subject to the same vesting and other terms and conditions as the corresponding unvested RSUs. DERs are accumulated and paid when the underlying shares vest. Upon approval of the 2014 Plan, the Company reserved 385 million shares plus the number of shares remaining that were reserved but not issued under the 2003 Plan. Shares subject to outstanding awards under the 2003 Plan that expire, are cancelled or otherwise terminate, or are withheld to satisfy tax withholding obligations with respect to RSUs, will also be available for awards under the 2014 Plan. As of September 24, 2016, approximately 386.4 million shares were reserved for future issuance under the 2014 Plan.Apple Inc. | 2016 Form 10-K | 62



2003 Employee Stock PlanThe 2003 Plan is a shareholder approved plan that provided for broad-based equity grants to employees, including executive officers. The 2003 Plan permitted the granting of incentive stock options, nonstatutory stock options, RSUs, stock appreciation rights, stock purchase rights and performance-based awards. Options granted under the 2003 Plan generally expire seven to ten years after the grant date and generally become exercisable over a period of four years, based on continued employment, with either annual, semi-annual or quarterly vesting. RSUs granted under the 2003 Plan generally vest over two to four years, based on continued employment and are settled upon vesting in shares of the Company’s common stock on a one-for-one basis. All RSUs, other than RSUs held by the Chief Executive Officer, granted under the 2003 Plan have DERs. DERs are subject to the same vesting and other terms and conditions as the corresponding unvested RSUs. DERs are accumulated and paid when the underlying shares vest. In the second quarter of 2014, the Company terminated the authority to grant new awards under the 2003 Plan.1997 Director Stock PlanThe 1997 Director Stock Plan (the “Director Plan”) is a shareholder approved plan that (i) permits the Company to grant awards of RSUs or stock options to the Company’s non-employee directors, (ii) provides for automatic initial grants of RSUs upon a non-employee director joining the Board of Directors and automatic annual grants of RSUs at each annual meeting of shareholders, and (iii) permits the Board of Directors to prospectively change the relative mixture of stock options and RSUs for the initial and annual award grants and the methodology for determining the number of shares of the Company’s common stock subject to these grants without shareholder approval. Each share issued with respect to RSUs granted under the Director Plan reduces the number of shares available for grant under the plan by two shares. The Director Plan expires November 9, 2019. All RSUs granted under the Director Plan are entitled to DERs. DERs are subject to the same vesting and other terms and conditions as the corresponding unvested RSUs. DERs are accumulated and paid when the underlying shares vest. As of September 24, 2016, approximately 1.1 million shares were reserved for future issuance under the Director Plan.Rule 10b5-1 Trading PlansDuring the three months ended September 24, 2016, Section 16 officers Timothy D. Cook, Angela Ahrendts, Luca Maestri, Daniel Riccio, Philip Schiller and Jeffrey Williams had equity trading plans in place in accordance with Rule 10b5-1(c)(1) under the Exchange Act. An equity trading plan is a written document that pre-establishes the amounts, prices and dates (or formula for determining the amounts, prices and dates) of future purchases or sales of the Company’s stock, including shares acquired pursuant to the Company’s employee and director equity plans.Employee Stock Purchase PlanThe Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the “Purchase Plan”) is a shareholder approved plan under which substantially all employees may purchase the Company’s common stock through payroll deductions at a price equal to 85% of the lower of the fair market values of the stock as of the beginning or the end of six-month offering periods. An employee’s payroll deductions under the Purchase Plan are limited to 10% of the employee’s compensation and employees may not purchase more than $25,000 of stock during any calendar year. As of September 24, 2016, approximately 47.0 million shares were reserved for future issuance under the Purchase Plan.401(k) PlanThe Company’s 401(k) Plan is a deferred salary arrangement under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code. Under the 401(k) Plan, participating U.S. employees may defer a portion of their pre-tax earnings, up to the IRS annual contribution limit ($18,000 for calendar year 2016). The Company matches 50% to 100% of each employee’s contributions, depending on length of service, up to a maximum 6% of the employee’s eligible earnings. Apple Inc. | 2016 Form 10-K | 63

Restricted Stock UnitsA summary of the Company’s RSU activity and related information for 2016, 2015 and 2014, is as follows:The fair value as of the respective vesting dates of RSUs was $5.1 billion, $4.8 billion and $3.4 billion for 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The majority of RSUs that vested in 2016, 2015 and 2014 were net-share settled such that the Company withheld shares with value equivalent to the employees’ minimum statutory obligation for the applicable income and other employment taxes, and remitted the cash to the appropriate taxing authorities. The total shares withheld were approximately 15.9 million, 14.1 million and 15.6 million for 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, and were based on the value of the RSUs on their respective vesting dates as determined by the Company’s closing stock price. Total payments for the employees’ tax obligations to taxing authorities were $1.7 billion, $1.6 billion and $1.2 billion in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, and are reflected as a financing activity within the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. These net-share settlements had the effect of share repurchases by the Company as they reduced the number of shares that would have otherwise been issued as a result of the vesting and did not represent an expense to the Company.Share-based CompensationThe following table shows a summary of the share-based compensation expense included in the Consolidated Statements of Operations for 2016, 2015 and 2014 (in millions):The income tax benefit related to share-based compensation expense was $1.4 billion, $1.2 billion and $1.0 billion for 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. As of September 24, 2016, the total unrecognized compensation cost related to outstanding stock options, RSUs and restricted stock was $7.5 billion, which the Company expects to recognize over a weighted-average period of 2.6 years.Apple Inc. | 2016 Form 10-K | 64

Note 10 – Commitments and ContingenciesAccrued Warranty and IndemnificationThe following table shows changes in the Company’s accrued warranties and related costs for 2016, 2015 and 2014 (in millions):The Company generally does not indemnify end-users of its operating system and application software against legal claims that the software infringes third-party intellectual property rights. Other agreements entered into by the Company sometimes include indemnification provisions under which the Company could be subject to costs and/or damages in the event of an infringement claim against the Company or an indemnified third-party. In the opinion of management, there was not at least a reasonable possibility the Company may have incurred a material loss with respect to indemnification of end-users of its operating system or application software for infringement of third-party intellectual property rights. The Company offers an iPhone Upgrade Program, which is available to customers who purchase a qualifying iPhone in the U.S., the U.K. and mainland China. The iPhone Upgrade Program provides customers the right to trade in that iPhone for a specified amount when purchasing a new iPhone, provided certain conditions are met. The Company accounts for the trade-in right as a guarantee liability and recognizes arrangement revenue net of the fair value of such right with subsequent changes to the guarantee liability recognized within revenue.The Company has entered into indemnification agreements with its directors and executive officers. Under these agreements, the Company has agreed to indemnify such individuals to the fullest extent permitted by law against liabilities that arise by reason of their status as directors or officers and to advance expenses incurred by such individuals in connection with related legal proceedings. It is not possible to determine the maximum potential amount of payments the Company could be required to make under these agreements due to the limited history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each claim. However, the Company maintains directors and officers liability insurance coverage to reduce its exposure to such obligations.Concentrations in the Available Sources of Supply of Materials and ProductAlthough most components essential to the Company’s business are generally available from multiple sources, a number of components are currently obtained from single or limited sources. In addition, the Company competes for various components with other participants in the markets for mobile communication and media devices and personal computers. Therefore, many components used by the Company, including those that are available from multiple sources, are at times subject to industry-wide shortage and significant pricing fluctuations that could materially adversely affect the Company’s financial condition and operating results.The Company uses some custom components that are not commonly used by its competitors, and new products introduced by the Company often utilize custom components available from only one source. When a component or product uses new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers’ yields have matured or manufacturing capacity has increased. If the Company’s supply of components for a new or existing product were delayed or constrained, or if an outsourcing partner delayed shipments of completed products to the Company, the Company’s financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected. The Company’s business and financial performance could also be materially adversely affected depending on the time required to obtain sufficient quantities from the original source, or to identify and obtain sufficient quantities from an alternative source. Continued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at all, may be affected if those suppliers concentrated on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the Company’s requirements.The Company has entered into agreements for the supply of many components; however, there can be no guarantee that the Company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms, or at all. Therefore, the Company remains subject to significant risks of supply shortages and price increases that could materially adversely affect its financial condition and operating results.Substantially all of the Company’s hardware products are manufactured by outsourcing partners that are located primarily in Asia. A significant concentration of this manufacturing is currently performed by a small number of outsourcing partners, often in single locations. Certain of these outsourcing partners are the sole-sourced suppliers of components and manufacturers for many of the Company’s products. Although the Company works closely with its outsourcing partners on manufacturing schedules, the Company’s operating results could be adversely affected if its outsourcing partners were unable to meet their production commitments. The Company’s manufacturing purchase obligations typically cover its requirements for periods up to 150 days.Apple Inc. | 2016 Form 10-K | 65

Other Off-Balance Sheet CommitmentsOperating LeasesThe Company leases various equipment and facilities, including retail space, under noncancelable operating lease arrangements. The Company does not currently utilize any other off-balance sheet financing arrangements. As of September 24, 2016, the Company’s total future minimum lease payments under noncancelable operating leases were $7.6 billion. The Company's retail store and other facility leases are typically for terms not exceeding 10 years and generally contain multi-year renewal options. Rent expense under all operating leases, including both cancelable and noncancelable leases, was $939 million, $794 million and $717 million in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Future minimum lease payments under noncancelable operating leases having remaining terms in excess of one year as of September 24, 2016, are as follows (in millions):ContingenciesThe Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that have arisen in the ordinary course of business and that have not been fully adjudicated, as further discussed in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K under the heading “Risk Factors” and in Part I, Item 3 of this Form 10-K under the heading “Legal Proceedings.” In the opinion of management, there was not at least a reasonable possibility the Company may have incurred a material loss, or a material loss in excess of a recorded accrual, with respect to loss contingencies for asserted legal and other claims. However, the outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain. Therefore, although management considers the likelihood of such an outcome to be remote, if one or more of these legal matters were resolved against the Company in a reporting period for amounts in excess of management’s expectations, the Company’s consolidated financial statements for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected.Apple Inc. v. Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd., et al.On August 24, 2012, a jury returned a verdict awarding the Company $1.05 billion in its lawsuit against Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. and affiliated parties in the United States District Court, Northern District of California, San Jose Division. On March 6, 2014, the District Court entered final judgment in favor of the Company in the amount of approximately $930 million. On May 18, 2015, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit affirmed in part, and reversed in part, the decision of the District Court. As a result, the Court of Appeals ordered entry of final judgment on damages in the amount of approximately $548 million, with the District Court to determine supplemental damages and interest, as well as damages owed for products subject to the reversal in part. Samsung paid $548 million to the Company in December 2015, which was included in net sales in the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations. Because the case remains subject to further proceedings, the Company has not recognized any further amounts in its results of operations. On October 11, 2016, the United States Supreme Court heard arguments in Samsung’s request for appeal related to the $548 million in damages.Note 11 – Segment Information and Geographic DataThe Company reports segment information based on the “management” approach. The management approach designates the internal reporting used by management for making decisions and assessing performance as the source of the Company’s reportable operating segments.The Company manages its business primarily on a geographic basis. The Company’s reportable operating segments consist of the Americas, Europe, Greater China, Japan and Rest of Asia Pacific. The Americas segment includes both North and South America. The Europe segment includes European countries, as well as India, the Middle East and Africa. The Greater China segment includes China, Hong Kong and Taiwan. The Rest of Asia Pacific segment includes Australia and those Asian countries not included in the Company’s other reportable operating segments. Although the reportable operating segments provide similar hardware and software products and similar services, each one is managed separately to better align with the location of the Company’s customers and distribution partners and the unique market dynamics of each geographic region. The accounting policies of the various segments are the same as those described in Note 1, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.”Apple Inc. | 2016 Form 10-K | 66

The Company evaluates the performance of its reportable operating segments based on net sales and operating income. Net sales for geographic segments are generally based on the location of customers and sales through the Company’s retail stores located in those geographic locations. Operating income for each segment includes net sales to third parties, related cost of sales and operating expenses directly attributable to the segment. Advertising expenses are generally included in the geographic segment in which the expenditures are incurred. Operating income for each segment excludes other income and expense and certain expenses managed outside the reportable operating segments. Costs excluded from segment operating income include various corporate expenses such as R&D, corporate marketing expenses, certain share-based compensation expenses, income taxes, various nonrecurring charges and other separately managed general and administrative costs. The Company does not include intercompany transfers between segments for management reporting purposes.The following table shows information by reportable operating segment for 2016, 2015 and 2014 (in millions):A reconciliation of the Company’s segment operating income to the Consolidated Statements of Operations for 2016, 2015 and 2014 is as follows (in millions):Apple Inc. | 2016 Form 10-K | 67

Report of Ernst & Young LLP, Independent Registered Public Accounting FirmThe Board of Directors and Shareholders of Apple Inc.We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Apple Inc. as of September 24, 2016 and September 26, 2015, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, shareholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 24, 2016. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Apple Inc. at September 24, 2016 and September 26, 2015, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 24, 2016, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), Apple Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of September 24, 2016, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated October 26, 2016 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.San Jose, CaliforniaOctober 26, 2016Apple Inc. | 2016 Form 10-K | 70



Report of Ernst & Young LLP, Independent Registered Public Accounting FirmThe Board of Directors and Shareholders of Apple Inc.We have audited Apple Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of September 24, 2016, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (“the COSO criteria”). Apple Inc.’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.In our opinion, Apple Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of September 24, 2016, based on the COSO criteria.We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the 2016 consolidated financial statements of Apple Inc. and our report dated October 26, 2016 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.San Jose, CaliforniaOctober 26, 2016Apple Inc. | 2016 Form 10-K | 71


# 2018 AAPL

## Item 1A


The Company has a minority market share in the global smartphone, tablet and personal computer markets. The Company faces substantial competition in these markets from companies that have significant technical, marketing, distribution and other resources, as well as established hardware, software and digital content supplier relationships. In addition, some of the Company’s competitors have broader product lines, lower-priced products and a larger installed base of active devices. Competition has been particularly intense as competitors have aggressively cut prices and lowered product margins. Certain competitors may have the resources, experience or cost structures to provide products at little or no profit or even at a loss.Additionally, the Company faces significant competition as competitors attempt to imitate the Company’s product features and applications within their own products or, alternatively, collaborate with each other to offer solutions that are more competitive than those they currently offer. The Company also expects competition to intensify as competitors attempt to imitate the Company’s approach to providing components seamlessly within their individual offerings or work collaboratively to offer integrated solutions.Some of the markets in which the Company competes, including the market for personal computers, have from time to time experienced little to no growth or contracted. In addition, an increasing number of internet-enabled devices that include software applications and are smaller, simpler and cheaper than traditional personal computers compete with some of the Company’s existing products.The Company’s services also face substantial competition, including from companies that have significant resources and experience and have established service offerings with large customer bases. The Company competes with business models that provide content to users for free. The Company also competes with illegitimate means to obtain third-party digital content and applications.The Company’s financial condition and operating results depend substantially on the Company’s ability to continually improve its products and services in order to maintain their functional and design advantages. There can be no assurance the Company will be able to continue to provide products and services that compete effectively.To remain competitive and stimulate customer demand, the Company must successfully manage frequent introductions and transitions of products and services.Due to the highly volatile and competitive nature of the industries in which the Company competes, the Company must continually introduce new products, services and technologies, enhance existing products and services, effectively stimulate customer demand for new and upgraded products and services and successfully manage the transition to these new and upgraded products and services. The success of new product and service introductions depends on a number of factors including, but not limited to, timely and successful development, market acceptance, the Company’s ability to manage the risks associated with new product production ramp-up issues, the availability of application software for new products, the effective management of purchase commitments and inventory levels in line with anticipated product demand, the availability of products in appropriate quantities and at expected costs to meet anticipated demand and the risk that new products and services may have quality or other defects or deficiencies. Accordingly, the Company cannot determine in advance the ultimate effect of new product and service introductions and transitions.The Company depends on the performance of carriers, wholesalers, retailers and other resellers.The Company distributes its products through cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers and resellers, many of whom distribute products from competing manufacturers. The Company also sells its products and third-party products in most of its major markets directly to education, enterprise and government customers and consumers and small and mid-sized businesses through its retail and online stores.Some carriers providing cellular network service for iPhone offer financing, installment payment plans or subsidies for users’ purchases of the device. There is no assurance that such offers will be continued at all or in the same amounts upon renewal of the Company’s agreements with these carriers or in agreements the Company enters into with new carriers.The Company has invested and will continue to invest in programs to enhance reseller sales, including staffing selected resellers’ stores with Company employees and contractors, and improving product placement displays. These programs could require a substantial investment while providing no assurance of return or incremental revenue. The financial condition of these resellers could weaken, these resellers could stop distributing the Company’s products, or uncertainty regarding demand for some or all of the Company’s products could cause resellers to reduce their ordering and marketing of the Company’s products.Apple Inc. | 2018 Form 10-K | 9



The Company faces substantial inventory and other asset risk in addition to purchase commitment cancellation risk.The Company records a write-down for product and component inventories that have become obsolete or exceed anticipated demand, or for which cost exceeds net realizable value. The Company also accrues necessary cancellation fee reserves for orders of excess products and components. The Company reviews long-lived assets, including capital assets held at its suppliers’ facilities and inventory prepayments, for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate the assets may not be recoverable. If the Company determines that an impairment has occurred, it records a write-down equal to the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value. Although the Company believes its inventory, capital assets, inventory prepayments and other assets and purchase commitments are currently recoverable, no assurance can be given that the Company will not incur write-downs, fees, impairments and other charges given the rapid and unpredictable pace of product obsolescence in the industries in which the Company competes.The Company orders components for its products and builds inventory in advance of product announcements and shipments. Manufacturing purchase obligations cover the Company’s forecasted component and manufacturing requirements, typically for periods up to 150 days. Because the Company’s markets are volatile, competitive and subject to rapid technology and price changes, there is a risk the Company will forecast incorrectly and order or produce excess or insufficient amounts of components or products, or not fully utilize firm purchase commitments.Future operating results depend upon the Company’s ability to obtain components in sufficient quantities on commercially reasonable terms.Because the Company currently obtains certain components from single or limited sources, the Company is subject to significant supply and pricing risks. Many components, including those that are available from multiple sources, are at times subject to industry-wide shortages and significant commodity pricing fluctuations that could materially adversely affect the Company’s financial condition and operating results. While the Company has entered into agreements for the supply of many components, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms, or at all. Component suppliers may suffer from poor financial conditions, which can lead to business failure for the supplier or consolidation within a particular industry, further limiting the Company’s ability to obtain sufficient quantities of components on commercially reasonable terms. The effects of global or regional economic conditions on the Company’s suppliers, described in “Global and regional economic conditions could materially adversely affect the Company’s business, results of operations, financial condition and growth” above, also could affect the Company’s ability to obtain components. Therefore, the Company remains subject to significant risks of supply shortages and price increases that could materially adversely affect its financial condition and operating results.The Company’s new products often utilize custom components available from only one source. When a component or product uses new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers’ yields have matured or manufacturing capacity has increased. Continued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at all, may be affected for any number of reasons, including if suppliers decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the Company’s requirements. If the Company’s supply of components for a new or existing product were delayed or constrained, or if an outsourcing partner delayed shipments of completed products to the Company, the Company’s financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected. The Company’s business and financial performance could also be materially adversely affected depending on the time required to obtain sufficient quantities from the original source, or to identify and obtain sufficient quantities from an alternative source.The Company depends on component and product manufacturing and logistical services provided by outsourcing partners, many of which are located outside of the U.S.Substantially all of the Company’s manufacturing is performed in whole or in part by outsourcing partners located primarily in Asia. A significant concentration of this manufacturing is currently performed by a small number of outsourcing partners, often in single locations. The Company has also outsourced much of its transportation and logistics management. While these arrangements may lower operating costs, they also reduce the Company’s direct control over production and distribution. Such diminished control may have an adverse effect on the quality or quantity of products or services, or the Company’s flexibility to respond to changing conditions. Although arrangements with these partners may contain provisions for warranty expense reimbursement, the Company may remain responsible to the consumer for warranty service in the event of product defects and could experience an unanticipated product defect or warranty liability. While the Company relies on its partners to adhere to its supplier code of conduct, material violations of the supplier code of conduct could occur.The Company relies on single-sourced outsourcing partners in the U.S., Asia and Europe to supply and manufacture many components, and on outsourcing partners primarily located in Asia, for final assembly of substantially all of the Company’s hardware products. Any failure of these partners to perform may have a negative impact on the Company’s cost or supply of components or finished goods. In addition, manufacturing or logistics in these locations or transit to final destinations may be disrupted for a variety of reasons including, but not limited to, natural and man-made disasters, information technology system failures, commercial disputes, military actions, economic, business, labor, environmental, public health or political issues, or international trade disputes.Apple Inc. | 2018 Form 10-K | 10



The Company has invested in manufacturing process equipment, much of which is held at certain of its outsourcing partners, and has made prepayments to certain of its suppliers associated with long-term supply agreements. While these arrangements help ensure the supply of components and finished goods, if these outsourcing partners or suppliers experience severe financial problems or other disruptions in their business, such continued supply could be reduced or terminated and the recoverability of manufacturing process equipment or prepayments could be negatively impacted.The Company’s products and services may be affected from time to time by design and manufacturing defects that could materially adversely affect the Company’s business and result in harm to the Company’s reputation.The Company offers complex hardware and software products and services that can be affected by design and manufacturing defects. Sophisticated operating system software and applications, such as those offered by the Company, often have issues that can unexpectedly interfere with the intended operation of hardware or software products. Defects may also exist in components and products the Company purchases from third parties. Component defects could make the Company’s products unsafe and create a risk of environmental or property damage and personal injury. These risks may increase as the Company’s products are introduced into specialized applications, including healthcare. In addition, the Company’s service offerings may have quality issues and from time to time experience outages, service slowdowns or errors. As a result, the Company’s services may not perform as anticipated and may not meet customer expectations. There can be no assurance the Company will be able to detect and fix all issues and defects in the hardware, software and services it offers. Failure to do so could result in widespread technical and performance issues affecting the Company’s products and services. In addition, the Company may be exposed to product liability claims, recalls, product replacements or modifications, write-offs of inventory, property, plant and equipment, and/or intangible assets, and significant warranty and other expenses, including litigation costs and regulatory fines. Quality problems could also adversely affect the experience for users of the Company’s products and services, and result in harm to the Company’s reputation, loss of competitive advantage, poor market acceptance, reduced demand for products and services, delay in new product and services introductions and lost revenue.The Company relies on access to third-party digital content, which may not be available to the Company on commercially reasonable terms or at all.The Company contracts with numerous third parties to offer their digital content to customers. This includes the right to sell currently available music, movies, TV shows and books. The licensing or other distribution arrangements with these third parties are for relatively short terms and do not guarantee the continuation or renewal of these arrangements on reasonable terms, if at all. Some third-party content providers and distributors currently or in the future may offer competing products and services, and could take action to make it more difficult or impossible for the Company to license or otherwise distribute their content in the future. Other content owners, providers or distributors may seek to limit the Company’s access to, or increase the cost of, such content. The Company may be unable to continue to offer a wide variety of content at reasonable prices with acceptable usage rules, or continue to expand its geographic reach. Failure to obtain the right to make third-party digital content available, or to make such content available on commercially reasonable terms, could have a material adverse impact on the Company’s financial condition and operating results.Some third-party digital content providers require the Company to provide digital rights management and other security solutions. If requirements change, the Company may have to develop or license new technology to provide these solutions. There is no assurance the Company will be able to develop or license such solutions at a reasonable cost and in a timely manner. In addition, certain countries have passed or may propose and adopt legislation that would force the Company to license its digital rights management, which could lessen the protection of content and subject it to piracy and also could negatively affect arrangements with the Company’s content providers.The Company’s future performance depends in part on support from third-party software developers.The Company believes decisions by customers to purchase its hardware products depend in part on the availability of third-party software applications and services. There is no assurance that third-party developers will continue to develop and maintain software applications and services for the Company’s products. If third-party software applications and services cease to be developed and maintained for the Company’s products, customers may choose not to buy the Company’s products.The Company believes the availability of third-party software applications and services for its products depends in part on the developers’ perception and analysis of the relative benefits of developing, maintaining and upgrading such software and services for the Company’s products compared to competitors’ platforms, such as Android for smartphones and tablets and Windows for personal computers. This analysis may be based on factors such as the market position of the Company and its products, the anticipated revenue that may be generated, expected future growth of product sales and the costs of developing such applications and services.Apple Inc. | 2018 Form 10-K | 11



The Company’s minority market share in the global smartphone, tablet and personal computer markets could make developers less inclined to develop or upgrade software for the Company’s products and more inclined to devote their resources to developing and upgrading software for competitors’ products with larger market share. If developers focus their efforts on these competing platforms, the availability and quality of applications for the Company’s devices may suffer.The Company relies on the continued availability and development of compelling and innovative software applications for its products. The Company’s products and operating systems are subject to rapid technological change, and if third-party developers are unable to or choose not to keep up with this pace of change, third-party applications might not take advantage of these changes to deliver improved customer experiences or might not operate correctly and may result in dissatisfied customers.The Company sells and delivers third-party applications for its products through the App Store, Mac App Store and TV App Store. The Company retains a commission from sales through these platforms. If developers reduce their use of these platforms to distribute their applications and offer in-app purchases to customers, then the volume of sales, and the commission that the Company earns on those sales, would decrease.The Company relies on access to third-party intellectual property, which may not be available to the Company on commercially reasonable terms or at all.Many of the Company’s products include third-party intellectual property, which requires licenses from those third parties. Based on past experience and industry practice, the Company believes such licenses generally can be obtained on reasonable terms. There is, however, no assurance that the necessary licenses can be obtained on acceptable terms or at all. Failure to obtain the right to use third-party intellectual property, or to use such intellectual property on commercially reasonable terms, could preclude the Company from selling certain products or services, or otherwise have a material adverse impact on the Company’s financial condition and operating results.The Company could be impacted by unfavorable results of legal proceedings, such as being found to have infringed on intellectual property rights.The Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that have arisen in the ordinary course of business and have not yet been fully resolved, and new claims may arise in the future. In addition, agreements entered into by the Company sometimes include indemnification provisions which may subject the Company to costs and damages in the event of a claim against an indemnified third party.Claims against the Company based on allegations of patent infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights have generally increased over time and may continue to increase. In particular, the Company has historically faced a significant number of patent claims relating to its cellular-enabled products, and new claims may arise in the future. For example, technology and other patent-holding companies frequently assert their patents and seek royalties and often enter into litigation based on allegations of patent infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. The Company is vigorously defending infringement actions in courts in a number of U.S. jurisdictions and before the U.S. International Trade Commission, as well as internationally in various countries. The plaintiffs in these actions frequently seek injunctions and substantial damages.Regardless of the merit of particular claims, litigation may be expensive, time consuming, disruptive to the Company’s operations and distracting to management. In recognition of these considerations, the Company may enter into licensing agreements or other arrangements to settle litigation and resolve such disputes. No assurance can be given that such agreements can be obtained on acceptable terms or that litigation will not occur. These agreements may also significantly increase the Company’s operating expenses.Except as described in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Note 9, “Commitments and Contingencies” under the heading “Contingencies,” in the opinion of management, there was not at least a reasonable possibility the Company may have incurred a material loss, or a material loss in excess of a recorded accrual, with respect to loss contingencies for asserted legal and other claims, including matters related to infringement of intellectual property rights.The outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain. If one or more legal matters were resolved against the Company or an indemnified third party in a reporting period for amounts in excess of management’s expectations, the Company’s financial condition and operating results for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected. Further, such an outcome could result in significant compensatory, punitive or trebled monetary damages, disgorgement of revenue or profits, remedial corporate measures or injunctive relief against the Company that could materially adversely affect its financial condition and operating results.While the Company maintains insurance coverage for certain types of claims, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise.Apple Inc. | 2018 Form 10-K | 12



The Company is subject to laws and regulations worldwide, changes to which could increase the Company’s costs and individually or in the aggregate adversely affect the Company’s business.The Company is subject to laws and regulations affecting its domestic and international operations in a number of areas. These U.S. and foreign laws and regulations affect the Company’s activities in areas including, but not limited to, labor, advertising, digital content, consumer protection, real estate, billing, e-commerce, promotions, quality of services, telecommunications, mobile communications and media, television, intellectual property ownership and infringement, tax, import and export requirements, anti-corruption, foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions, data privacy and data localization requirements, anti-competition, environmental, health and safety.By way of example, laws and regulations related to mobile communications and media devices in the many jurisdictions in which the Company operates are extensive and subject to change. Such changes could include, among others, restrictions on the production, manufacture, distribution and use of devices, locking devices to a carrier’s network, or mandating the use of devices on more than one carrier’s network. These devices are also subject to certification and regulation by governmental and standardization bodies, as well as by cellular network carriers for use on their networks. These certification processes are extensive and time consuming, and could result in additional testing requirements, product modifications, or delays in product shipment dates, or could preclude the Company from selling certain products.Compliance with these laws, regulations and similar requirements may be onerous and expensive, and they may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, further increasing the cost of compliance and doing business. Any such costs, which may rise in the future as a result of changes in these laws and regulations or in their interpretation, could individually or in the aggregate make the Company’s products and services less attractive to the Company’s customers, delay the introduction of new products in one or more regions, or cause the Company to change or limit its business practices. The Company has implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations, but there can be no assurance that the Company’s employees, contractors, or agents will not violate such laws and regulations or the Company’s policies and procedures.The Company’s business is subject to the risks of international operations.The Company derives a majority of its revenue and earnings from its international operations. Compliance with applicable U.S. and foreign laws and regulations, such as import and export requirements, anti-corruption laws, tax laws, foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions, data privacy and data localization requirements, environmental laws, labor laws and anti-competition regulations, increases the costs of doing business in foreign jurisdictions. Although the Company has implemented policies and procedures to comply with these laws and regulations, a violation by the Company’s employees, contractors or agents could nevertheless occur. In some cases, compliance with the laws and regulations of one country could violate the laws and regulations of another country. Violations of these laws and regulations could materially adversely affect the Company’s brand, international growth efforts and business.The Company also could be significantly affected by other risks associated with international activities including, but not limited to, economic and labor conditions, increased duties, taxes and other costs, political instability and international trade disputes. Gross margins on the Company’s products in foreign countries, and on products that include components obtained from foreign suppliers, could be materially adversely affected by international trade regulations, including duties, tariffs and antidumping penalties. The Company is also exposed to credit and collectibility risk on its trade receivables with customers in certain international markets. There can be no assurance the Company can effectively limit its credit risk and avoid losses.The Company’s retail stores have required and will continue to require a substantial investment and commitment of resources and are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties.The Company’s retail stores have required substantial investment in equipment and leasehold improvements, information systems, inventory and personnel. The Company also has entered into substantial operating lease commitments for retail space. Certain stores have been designed and built to serve as high-profile venues to promote brand awareness. Because of their unique design elements, locations and size, these stores require substantially more investment than the Company’s more typical retail stores. Due to the high cost structure associated with the Company’s retail stores, a decline in sales or the closure or poor performance of individual or multiple stores could result in significant lease termination costs, write-offs of equipment and leasehold improvements and severance costs.The Company’s retail operations are subject to many factors that pose risks and uncertainties and could adversely impact the Company’s financial condition and operating results, including macro-economic factors that could have an adverse effect on general retail activity. Other factors include, but are not limited to, the Company’s ability to manage costs associated with retail store construction and operation; manage relationships with existing retail partners; manage costs associated with fluctuations in the value of retail inventory; and obtain and renew leases in quality retail locations at a reasonable cost.Apple Inc. | 2018 Form 10-K | 13



Investment in new business strategies and acquisitions could disrupt the Company’s ongoing business and present risks not originally contemplated.The Company has invested, and in the future may invest, in new business strategies or acquisitions. Such endeavors may involve significant risks and uncertainties, including distraction of management from current operations, greater than expected liabilities and expenses, inadequate return of capital and unidentified issues not discovered in the Company’s due diligence. These new ventures are inherently risky and may not be successful.The Company’s business and reputation may be impacted by information technology system failures or network disruptions.The Company may be subject to information technology system failures or network disruptions caused by natural disasters, accidents, power disruptions, telecommunications failures, acts of terrorism or war, computer viruses, physical or electronic break-ins, or other events or disruptions. System redundancy and other continuity measures may be ineffective or inadequate, and the Company’s business continuity and disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities. Such failures or disruptions could adversely impact the Company’s business by, among other things, preventing access to the Company’s online services, interfering with customer transactions or impeding the manufacturing and shipping of the Company’s products. These events could materially adversely affect the Company’s reputation, financial condition and operating results.There may be losses or unauthorized access to or releases of confidential information, including personally identifiable information, that could subject the Company to significant reputational, financial, legal and operational consequences.The Company’s business requires it to use and store confidential information including, among other things, personally identifiable information (“PII”) with respect to the Company’s customers and employees. The Company devotes significant resources to network and data security, including through the use of encryption and other security measures intended to protect its systems and data. But these measures cannot provide absolute security, and losses or unauthorized access to or releases of confidential information occur and could materially adversely affect the Company’s reputation, financial condition and operating results.The Company’s business also requires it to share confidential information with suppliers and other third parties. Although the Company takes steps to secure confidential information that is provided to third parties, such measures are not always effective and losses or unauthorized access to or releases of confidential information occur and could materially adversely affect the Company’s reputation, financial condition and operating results.For example, the Company may experience a security breach impacting the Company’s information technology systems that compromises the confidentiality, integrity or availability of confidential information. Such an incident could, among other things, impair the Company’s ability to attract and retain customers for its products and services, impact the Company’s stock price, materially damage supplier relationships, and expose the Company to litigation or government investigations, which could result in penalties, fines or judgments against the Company.Although malicious attacks perpetrated to gain access to confidential information, including PII, affect many companies across various industries, the Company is at a relatively greater risk of being targeted because of its high profile and the value of the confidential information it creates, owns, manages, stores and processes.The Company has implemented systems and processes intended to secure its information technology systems and prevent unauthorized access to or loss of sensitive data, including through the use of encryption and authentication technologies. As with all companies, these security measures may not be sufficient for all eventualities and may be vulnerable to hacking, employee error, malfeasance, system error, faulty password management or other irregularities. For example, third parties attempt to fraudulently induce employees or customers into disclosing user names, passwords or other sensitive information, which may in turn be used to access the Company’s information technology systems. To help protect customers and the Company, the Company monitors its services and systems for unusual activity and may freeze accounts under suspicious circumstances, which, among other things, may result in the delay or loss of customer orders or impede customer access to the Company’s products and services.In addition to the risks relating to general confidential information described above, the Company may also be subject to specific obligations relating to health data and payment card data. Health data may be subject to additional privacy, security and breach notification requirements, and the Company may be subject to audit by governmental authorities regarding the Company’s compliance with these obligations. If the Company fails to adequately comply with these rules and requirements, or if health data is handled in a manner not permitted by law or under the Company’s agreements with healthcare institutions, the Company could be subject to litigation or government investigations, may be liable for associated investigatory expenses, and could also incur significant fees or fines.Apple Inc. | 2018 Form 10-K | 14



Under payment card rules and obligations, if cardholder information is potentially compromised, the Company could be liable for associated investigatory expenses and could also incur significant fees or fines if the Company fails to follow payment card industry data security standards. The Company could also experience a significant increase in payment card transaction costs or lose the ability to process payment cards if it fails to follow payment card industry data security standards, which would materially adversely affect the Company’s reputation, financial condition and operating results.While the Company maintains insurance coverage that is intended to address certain aspects of data security risks, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise.The Company’s business is subject to a variety of U.S. and international laws, rules, policies and other obligations regarding data protection.The Company is subject to federal, state and international laws relating to the collection, use, retention, security and transfer of PII. In many cases, these laws apply not only to third-party transactions, but also may restrict transfers of PII among the Company and its international subsidiaries. Several jurisdictions have passed laws in this area, and other jurisdictions are considering imposing additional restrictions. These laws continue to develop and may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Complying with emerging and changing international requirements may cause the Company to incur substantial costs or require the Company to change its business practices. Noncompliance could result in significant penalties or legal liability.The Company makes statements about its use and disclosure of PII through its privacy policy, information provided on its website and press statements. Any failure by the Company to comply with these public statements or with other federal, state or international privacy-related or data protection laws and regulations could result in proceedings against the Company by governmental entities or others. In addition to reputational impacts, penalties could include ongoing audit requirements and significant legal liability.The Company’s success depends largely on the continued service and availability of key personnel.Much of the Company’s future success depends on the continued availability and service of key personnel, including its Chief Executive Officer, executive team and other highly skilled employees. Experienced personnel in the technology industry are in high demand and competition for their talents is intense, especially in Silicon Valley, where most of the Company’s key personnel are located.The Company’s business may be impacted by political events, international trade disputes, war, terrorism, natural disasters, public health issues, industrial accidents and other business interruptions.Political events, international trade disputes, war, terrorism, natural disasters, public health issues, industrial accidents and other business interruptions could harm or disrupt international commerce and the global economy, and could have a material adverse effect on the Company and its customers, suppliers, contract manufacturers, logistics providers, distributors, cellular network carriers and other channel partners.International trade disputes could result in tariffs and other protectionist measures that could adversely affect the Company’s business. Tariffs could increase the cost of the Company’s products and the components and raw materials that go into making them. These increased costs could adversely impact the gross margin that the Company earns on its products. Tariffs could also make the Company’s products more expensive for customers, which could make the Company’s products less competitive and reduce consumer demand. Countries may also adopt other protectionist measures that could limit the Company’s ability to offer its products and services. Political uncertainty surrounding international trade disputes and protectionist measures could also have a negative effect on consumer confidence and spending, which could adversely affect the Company’s business.Many of the Company’s operations and facilities as well as critical business operations of the Company’s suppliers and contract manufacturers are in locations that are prone to earthquakes and other natural disasters. In addition, such operations and facilities are subject to the risk of interruption by fire, power shortages, nuclear power plant accidents and other industrial accidents, terrorist attacks and other hostile acts, labor disputes, public health issues and other events beyond the Company’s control. Global climate change could result in certain types of natural disasters occurring more frequently or with more intense effects. Such events could make it difficult or impossible for the Company to manufacture and deliver products to its customers, create delays and inefficiencies in the Company’s supply and manufacturing chain, and result in slowdowns and outages to the Company’s service offerings. Following an interruption to its business, the Company could require substantial recovery time, experience significant expenditures in order to resume operations, and lose significant revenue. Because the Company relies on single or limited sources for the supply and manufacture of many critical components, a business interruption affecting such sources would exacerbate any negative consequences to the Company.Apple Inc. | 2018 Form 10-K | 15



The Company’s operations are also subject to the risks of industrial accidents at its suppliers and contract manufacturers. While the Company’s suppliers are required to maintain safe working environments and operations, an industrial accident could occur and could result in disruption to the Company’s business and harm to the Company’s reputation. Should major public health issues, including pandemics, arise, the Company could be adversely affected by more stringent employee travel restrictions, additional limitations in freight services, governmental actions limiting the movement of products between regions, delays in production ramps of new products and disruptions in the operations of the Company’s suppliers and contract manufacturers.The Company expects its quarterly revenue and operating results to fluctuate.The Company’s profit margins vary across its products, services, geographic segments and distribution channels. For example, gross margins on the Company’s hardware products vary across product lines and can change over time as a result of product transitions, pricing and configuration changes, and component, warranty and other cost fluctuations. The Company’s financial results may be materially adversely impacted as a result of shifts in the mix of products and services that the Company sells; shifts in the geographic, currency or channel mix of the Company’s sales; component cost increases; price competition; or the introduction of new products, including new products with higher cost structures.The Company has typically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters due in part to seasonal holiday demand. Additionally, new product introductions can significantly impact net sales, product costs and operating expenses. Further, the Company generates a majority of its net sales from a single product and a decline in demand for that product could significantly impact quarterly net sales. The Company could also be subject to unexpected developments, such as lower-than-anticipated demand for the Company’s products, issues with new product introductions, information technology system failures or network disruptions, or failure of one of the Company’s logistics, components supply, or manufacturing partners.The Company’s stock price is subject to volatility.The Company’s stock price has experienced substantial price volatility in the past and may continue to do so in the future. Additionally, the Company, the technology industry and the stock market as a whole have experienced extreme stock price and volume fluctuations that have affected stock prices in ways that may have been unrelated to these companies’ operating performance. Price volatility over a given period may cause the average price at which the Company repurchases its own stock to exceed the stock’s price at a given point in time. The Company believes its stock price should reflect expectations of future growth and profitability. The Company also believes its stock price should reflect expectations that its cash dividend will continue at current levels or grow and that its current share repurchase program will be fully consummated. Future dividends are subject to declaration by the Company’s Board of Directors, and the Company’s share repurchase program does not obligate it to acquire any specific number of shares. If the Company fails to meet expectations related to future growth, profitability, dividends, share repurchases or other market expectations, its stock price may decline significantly, which could have a material adverse impact on investor confidence and employee retention.The Company’s financial performance is subject to risks associated with changes in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to local currencies.The Company’s primary exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates relates to non–U.S. dollar–denominated sales and operating expenses worldwide. Gross margins on the Company’s products in foreign countries and on products that include components obtained from foreign suppliers could be materially adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.Weakening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar adversely affects the U.S. dollar value of the Company’s foreign currency–denominated sales and earnings, and generally leads the Company to raise international pricing, potentially reducing demand for the Company’s products. In some circumstances, for competitive or other reasons, the Company may decide not to raise international pricing to offset the U.S. dollar’s strengthening, which would adversely affect the U.S. dollar value of the gross margins the Company earns on foreign currency–denominated sales.Conversely, a strengthening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, while generally beneficial to the Company’s foreign currency–denominated sales and earnings, could cause the Company to reduce international pricing and incur losses on its foreign currency derivative instruments, thereby limiting the benefit. Additionally, strengthening of foreign currencies may increase the Company’s cost of product components denominated in those currencies, thus adversely affecting gross margins.The Company uses derivative instruments, such as foreign currency forward and option contracts, to hedge certain exposures to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. The use of such hedging activities may not be effective to offset any, or more than a portion, of the adverse financial effects of unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates over the limited time the hedges are in place.Apple Inc. | 2018 Form 10-K | 16



The Company is exposed to credit risk and fluctuations in the market values of its investment portfolio.The Company’s investments can be negatively affected by liquidity, credit deterioration, financial results, market and economic conditions, political risk, sovereign risk, interest rate fluctuations or other factors. As a result, the value and liquidity of the Company’s cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities may fluctuate substantially. Therefore, although the Company has not realized any significant losses on its cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, future fluctuations in their value could result in significant realized losses and could have a material adverse impact on the Company’s financial condition and operating results.The Company is exposed to credit risk on its trade accounts receivable, vendor non-trade receivables and prepayments related to long-term supply agreements, and this risk is heightened during periods when economic conditions worsen.The Company distributes its products through third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers and resellers. The Company also sells its products directly to small and mid-sized businesses and education, enterprise and government customers. A substantial majority of the Company’s outstanding trade receivables are not covered by collateral, third-party bank support or financing arrangements, or credit insurance. The Company’s exposure to credit and collectibility risk on its trade receivables is higher in certain international markets and its ability to mitigate such risks may be limited. The Company also has unsecured vendor non-trade receivables resulting from purchases of components by outsourcing partners and other vendors that manufacture sub-assemblies or assemble final products for the Company. In addition, the Company has made prepayments associated with long-term supply agreements to secure supply of inventory components. As of September 29, 2018, a significant portion of the Company’s trade receivables was concentrated within cellular network carriers, and its vendor non-trade receivables and prepayments related to long-term supply agreements were concentrated among a few individual vendors located primarily in Asia. While the Company has procedures to monitor and limit exposure to credit risk on its trade and vendor non-trade receivables, as well as long-term prepayments, there can be no assurance such procedures will effectively limit its credit risk and avoid losses.The Company could be subject to changes in its tax rates, the adoption of new U.S. or international tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities.The Company is subject to taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions, including Ireland, where a number of the Company’s subsidiaries are organized. Due to economic and political conditions, tax rates in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change. The Company’s effective tax rates could be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, or changes in tax laws or their interpretation, including in the U.S. and Ireland.The Company is also subject to the examination of its tax returns and other tax matters by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”) and other tax authorities and governmental bodies. The Company regularly assesses the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of its provision for taxes. There can be no assurance as to the outcome of these examinations. If the Company’s effective tax rates were to increase, particularly in the U.S. or Ireland, or if the ultimate determination of the Company’s taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued, the Company’s financial condition, operating results and cash flows could be materially adversely affected.None.Apple Inc. | 2018 Form 10-K | 17

Gross margin increased in 2017 compared to 2016 due primarily to a shift in mix to Services and an overall increase in product volumes. Gross margin percentage decreased year-over-year due primarily to higher product costs, partially offset by a favorable shift in mix to Services. The weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar had an unfavorable impact on gross margin and gross margin percentage during 2017.The Company anticipates gross margin percentage during the first quarter of 2019 to be between 38.0% and 38.5%. The foregoing statement regarding the Company’s expected gross margin percentage in the first quarter of 2019 is forward-looking and could differ from actual results. The Company’s future gross margins can be impacted by multiple factors including, but not limited to, those set forth in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K under the heading “Risk Factors” and those described in this paragraph. In general, the Company believes gross margins will be subject to volatility and remain under downward pressure due to a variety of factors, including: continued industry-wide global product pricing pressures and product pricing actions that the Company may take in response to such pressures; increased competition; the Company’s ability to effectively stimulate demand for certain of its products; compressed product life cycles; potential increases in the cost of components and outside manufacturing services; the Company’s ability to manage product quality and warranty costs effectively; shifts in the mix of products and services, or in the geographic, currency or channel mix; fluctuations in exchange rates; and costs associated with the Company’s frequent introductions and transitions of products and services.Operating ExpensesOperating expenses for 2018, 2017 and 2016 were as follows (dollars in millions):Research and DevelopmentThe year-over-year growth in R&D expense in 2018 was driven primarily by increases in headcount-related expenses, infrastructure-related costs and material costs to support expanded R&D activities. R&D expense increased during 2017 compared to 2016 due primarily to increases in headcount-related expenses and material costs to support expanded R&D activities. The Company continues to believe that focused investments in R&D are critical to its future growth and competitive position in the marketplace, and to the development of new and updated products and services that are central to the Company’s core business strategy.Selling, General and AdministrativeThe year-over-year growth in selling, general and administrative expense in 2018 was driven primarily by increases in in headcount-related expenses, professional services and infrastructure-related costs. The increase in selling, general and administrative expense in 2017 compared to 2016 was driven primarily by an increase in headcount-related expenses, variable selling expenses and infrastructure-related costs.Other Income/(Expense), NetOther income/(expense), net for 2018, 2017 and 2016 was as follows (dollars in millions):The year-over-year decrease in other income/(expense), net during 2018 was due primarily to higher interest expense on debt and the impact of foreign exchange–related items, partially offset by higher interest income. The year-over-year increase in other income/(expense), net during 2017 was due primarily to higher interest income and the favorable impact of foreign exchange–related items, partially offset by higher interest expense on debt. The weighted-average interest rate earned by the Company on its cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities was 2.16%, 1.99% and 1.73% in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.Apple Inc. | 2018 Form 10-K | 27

Provision for Income TaxesProvision for income taxes and effective tax rates for 2018, 2017 and 2016 were as follows (dollars in millions):On December 22, 2017, the U.S. enacted the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Act”), which significantly changed U.S. tax law. The Act lowered the Company’s U.S. statutory federal income tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018, while also imposing a deemed repatriation tax on previously deferred foreign income. By operation of law, the Company applied a blended U.S. statutory federal income tax rate of 24.5% for 2018 (the “2018 blended U.S. tax rate”). The Act also created a new minimum tax on certain future foreign earnings.The Company’s effective tax rate for 2018 was lower than the 2018 blended U.S. tax rate due primarily to the lower tax rate on foreign earnings, partially offset by the remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities as a result of the Act.The Company’s effective tax rates for 2017 and 2016 were lower than the historical statutory federal income tax rate of 35% due primarily to certain undistributed foreign earnings, a substantial portion of which was generated by subsidiaries organized in Ireland, for which no U.S. taxes were provided when such earnings were intended to be indefinitely reinvested outside the U.S.The lower effective tax rate in 2018 compared to 2017 was due primarily to the lower 2018 blended U.S. tax rate, partially offset by the remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities as a result of the Act. The lower effective tax rate in 2017 compared to 2016 was due to a different geographic mix of earnings and higher U.S. R&D tax credits.As a result of adopting Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2016-09, Compensation – Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting (“ASU 2016-09”), in 2018, the Company records any excess tax benefits or deficiencies from its equity awards as part of the provision for income taxes. The Company anticipates that these excess tax benefits or deficiencies will have the greatest impact on its effective tax rates in the first and third quarters, as the majority of the Company’s equity awards vest in those quarters.As of September 29, 2018, the Company had deferred tax assets arising from deductible temporary differences, tax losses and tax credits of $6.3 billion and deferred tax liabilities of $426 million. Management believes it is more likely than not that forecasted income, including income that may be generated as a result of certain tax planning strategies, together with future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, will be sufficient to recover the deferred tax assets. The Company will continue to evaluate the realizability of deferred tax assets quarterly by assessing the need for and the amount of a valuation allowance.On August 30, 2016, the European Commission announced its decision that Ireland granted state aid to the Company by providing tax opinions in 1991 and 2007 concerning the tax allocation of profits of the Irish branches of two subsidiaries of the Company (the “State Aid Decision”). The State Aid Decision ordered Ireland to calculate and recover additional taxes from the Company for the period June 2003 through December 2014. The recovery amount was calculated to be €13.1 billion, plus interest of €1.2 billion. Irish legislative changes, effective as of January 2015, eliminated the application of the tax opinions from that date forward. The Company believes the State Aid Decision to be without merit and appealed to the General Court of the Court of Justice of the European Union. Ireland has also appealed the State Aid Decision. The Company believes that any incremental Irish corporate income taxes potentially due related to the State Aid Decision would be creditable against U.S. taxes, subject to any foreign tax credit limitations in the Act. As of September 29, 2018, the entire recovery amount plus interest was funded into escrow, where it will remain restricted from general use pending conclusion of all appeals.On July 24, 2018, the U.S. Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the U.S. Tax Court's decision in Altera Corp v. Commissioner, regarding the inclusion of share-based compensation in cost-sharing arrangements with foreign subsidiaries. The reversal was subsequently withdrawn, and the Company believes adequate provision has been made for any adjustments that may result from the final resolution of the case.Recent Accounting PronouncementsHedgingIn August 2017, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the “FASB”) issued ASU No. 2017-12, Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities (“ASU 2017-12”). ASU 2017-12 expands component and fair value hedging, specifies the presentation of the effects of hedging instruments, and eliminates the separate measurement and presentation of hedge ineffectiveness. The Company will adopt ASU 2017-12 in its first quarter of 2020 utilizing the modified retrospective transition method and is currently evaluating the impact of adoption on its consolidated financial statements.Apple Inc. | 2018 Form 10-K | 28



Income TaxesIn October 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-16, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory (“ASU 2016-16”), which requires the recognition of the income tax consequences of an intra-entity transfer of an asset, other than inventory, when the transfer occurs. The Company will adopt ASU 2016-16 in its first quarter of 2019 utilizing the modified retrospective transition method. Currently, the Company estimates recording $3 billion of net deferred tax assets on its Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets upon adoption. However, the ultimate impact of adopting ASU 2016-16 will depend on the balance of intellectual property transferred between its subsidiaries as of the adoption date, as well as the deferred tax impact of the new minimum tax on certain future foreign earnings. The Company will recognize incremental deferred income tax expense thereafter as these net deferred tax assets are utilized.Leases In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) (“ASU 2016-02”), which modifies lease accounting for lessees to increase transparency and comparability by recording lease assets and liabilities for operating leases and disclosing key information about leasing arrangements. The Company will adopt ASU 2016-02 utilizing the modified retrospective transition method through a cumulative-effect adjustment at the beginning of its first quarter of 2020. While the Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting ASU 2016-02, based on the lease portfolio as of September 29, 2018, the Company anticipates recording lease assets and liabilities of approximately $8.9 billion on its Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets, with no material impact to its Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. However, the ultimate impact of adopting ASU 2016-02 will depend on the Company’s lease portfolio as of the adoption date.Financial Instruments In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-01, Financial Instruments – Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities (“ASU 2016-01”), which updates certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of financial instruments. The Company will adopt ASU 2016-01 in its first quarter of 2019 utilizing the modified retrospective transition method. Based on the composition of the Company’s investment portfolio, the adoption of ASU 2016-01 is not expected to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments – Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments (“ASU 2016-13”), which modifies the measurement of expected credit losses of certain financial instruments. The Company will adopt ASU 2016-13 in its first quarter of 2021 utilizing the modified retrospective transition method. Based on the composition of the Company’s investment portfolio, current market conditions, and historical credit loss activity, the adoption of ASU 2016-13 is not expected to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.Revenue Recognition In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) (“ASU 2014-09”), which amends the existing accounting standards for revenue recognition. ASU 2014-09 is based on principles that govern the recognition of revenue at an amount an entity expects to be entitled when products are transferred to customers.Subsequently, the FASB issued additional ASUs to clarify the guidance in ASU 2014-09. ASU 2014-09 and its related ASUs are collectively referred to herein as the “new revenue standard.” The new revenue standard may be applied retrospectively to each prior period presented or retrospectively with the cumulative effect recognized as of the date of adoption. The Company will adopt the new revenue standard in its first quarter of 2019 utilizing the full retrospective transition method. The new revenue standard will not have a material impact on the amount and timing of revenue recognized in the Company’s consolidated financial statements.Apple Inc. | 2018 Form 10-K | 29

The Company plans to pay the deemed repatriation tax payable in installments in accordance with the Act.Other Non-Current LiabilitiesThe Company’s remaining other non-current liabilities primarily consist of items for which the Company is unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments; therefore, such amounts are not included in the above contractual obligation table.IndemnificationAgreements entered into by the Company may include indemnification provisions which may subject the Company to costs and damages in the event of a claim against an indemnified third party. Except as disclosed in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Note 9, “Commitments and Contingencies” under the heading “Contingencies,” in the opinion of management, there was not at least a reasonable possibility the Company may have incurred a material loss, or a material loss in excess of a recorded accrual, with respect to indemnification of third parties.The Company offers an iPhone Upgrade Program, which is available to customers who purchase a qualifying iPhone in the U.S., the U.K. and mainland China. The iPhone Upgrade Program provides customers the right to trade in that iPhone for a specified amount when purchasing a new iPhone, provided certain conditions are met. The Company accounts for the trade-in right as a guarantee liability and recognizes arrangement revenue net of the fair value of such right, with subsequent changes to the guarantee liability recognized within revenue.The Company has entered into indemnification agreements with its directors and executive officers. Under these agreements, the Company has agreed to indemnify such individuals to the fullest extent permitted by law against liabilities that arise by reason of their status as directors or officers of the Company, and to advance expenses incurred by such individuals in connection with related legal proceedings. It is not possible to determine the maximum potential amount of payments the Company could be required to make under these agreements due to the limited history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each claim. While the Company maintains directors and officers liability insurance coverage, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise.Critical Accounting Policies and EstimatesThe preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) and the Company’s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and operating results require the Company’s management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported in its consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Note 1, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Company’s consolidated financial statements. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. Actual results may differ from these estimates, and such differences may be material.Management believes the Company’s critical accounting policies and estimates are those related to revenue recognition, valuation and impairment of marketable securities, inventory valuation, valuation of manufacturing-related assets and estimation of purchase commitment cancellation fees, warranty costs, income taxes, and legal and other contingencies. Management considers these policies critical because they are both important to the portrayal of the Company’s financial condition and operating results, and they require management to make judgments and estimates about inherently uncertain matters. The Company’s senior management has reviewed these critical accounting policies and related disclosures with the Audit and Finance Committee of the Company’s Board of Directors.Apple Inc. | 2018 Form 10-K | 32



Revenue RecognitionNet sales consist primarily of revenue from the sale of hardware, software, digital content and applications, accessories, and service and support contracts. The Company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the sales price is fixed or determinable and collection is probable. Product is considered delivered to the customer once it has been shipped and title, risk of loss and rewards of ownership have been transferred. For most of the Company’s product sales, these criteria are met at the time the product is shipped. For online sales to individuals, for some sales to education customers in the U.S., and for certain other sales, the Company defers revenue until the customer receives the product because the Company retains a portion of the risk of loss on these sales during transit. For payment terms in excess of the Company’s standard payment terms, revenue is recognized as payments become due unless the Company has positive evidence that the sales price is fixed or determinable, such as a successful history of collection, without concession, on comparable arrangements. The Company recognizes revenue from the sale of hardware products, software bundled with hardware that is essential to the functionality of the hardware and third-party digital content sold on the iTunes Store in accordance with general revenue recognition accounting guidance. The Company recognizes revenue in accordance with industry-specific software accounting guidance for the following types of sales transactions: (i) standalone sales of software products, (ii) sales of software upgrades and (iii) sales of software bundled with hardware not essential to the functionality of the hardware.For multi-element arrangements that include hardware products containing software essential to the hardware product’s functionality, undelivered software elements that relate to the hardware product’s essential software and/or undelivered non-software services, the Company allocates revenue to all deliverables based on their relative selling prices. In such circumstances, the Company uses a hierarchy to determine the selling price to be used for allocating revenue to deliverables: (i) vendor-specific objective evidence of fair value (“VSOE”), (ii) third-party evidence of selling price (“TPE”) and (iii) best estimate of selling price (“ESP”). VSOE generally exists only when the Company sells the deliverable separately and is the price actually charged by the Company for that deliverable. ESPs reflect the Company’s best estimates of what the selling prices of elements would be if they were sold regularly on a stand-alone basis.For sales of iPhone, iPad, Mac and certain other products, the Company has indicated it may from time to time provide future unspecified software upgrades to the device’s essential software and/or non-software services free of charge. Because the Company has neither VSOE nor TPE for the unspecified software upgrade rights or the non-software services, revenue is allocated to these rights and services based on the Company’s ESPs. Revenue allocated to the unspecified software upgrade rights and non-software services based on the Company’s ESPs is deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis over the estimated period the software upgrades and non-software services are expected to be provided.The Company’s process for determining ESPs involves management’s judgment and considers multiple factors that may vary over time depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each deliverable. Should future facts and circumstances change, the Company’s ESPs and the future rate of related amortization for unspecified software upgrades and non-software services related to future sales of these devices could change. Factors subject to change include the unspecified software upgrade rights and non-software services offered, the estimated value of unspecified software upgrade rights and non-software services and the estimated period unspecified software upgrades and non-software services are expected to be provided.The Company records reductions to revenue for estimated commitments related to price protection and other customer incentive programs. For transactions involving price protection, the Company recognizes revenue net of the estimated amount to be refunded, provided the refund amount can be reasonably and reliably estimated and the other conditions for revenue recognition have been met. The Company’s policy requires that, if refunds cannot be reliably estimated, revenue is not recognized until reliable estimates can be made or the price protection lapses. For the Company’s other customer incentive programs, the estimated cost is recognized at the later of the date at which the Company has sold the product or the date at which the program is offered. The Company also records reductions to revenue for expected future product returns based on the Company’s historical experience. Future market conditions and product transitions may require the Company to increase customer incentive programs that could result in reductions to future revenue. Additionally, certain customer incentive programs require management to estimate the number of customers who will actually redeem the incentive. Management’s estimates are based on historical experience and the specific terms and conditions of particular incentive programs. If a greater than estimated proportion of customers redeems such incentives, the Company would be required to record additional reductions to revenue, which would have an adverse impact on the Company’s operating results.Apple Inc. | 2018 Form 10-K | 33



Valuation and Impairment of Marketable SecuritiesThe Company’s investments in available-for-sale securities are reported at fair value. Unrealized gains and losses related to changes in the fair value of securities are generally recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income, net of tax, in the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets. Changes in the fair value of available-for-sale securities impact the Company’s net income only when such securities are sold or an other-than-temporary impairment is recognized. Realized gains and losses on the sale of securities are determined by specific identification of each security’s cost basis. The Company regularly reviews its investment portfolio to determine if any security is other-than-temporarily impaired, which would require the Company to record an impairment charge in the period any such determination is made. In making this determination, the Company evaluates, among other things, the duration and extent to which the fair value of a security is less than its cost; the financial condition of the issuer and any changes thereto; and the Company’s intent to sell, or whether it will more likely than not be required to sell, the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis. The Company’s assessment of whether a security is other-than-temporarily impaired could change in the future due to new developments or changes in assumptions related to any particular security, which would have an adverse impact on the Company’s financial condition and operating results.Inventory Valuation, Valuation of Manufacturing-Related Assets and Estimation of Purchase Commitment Cancellation FeesThe Company purchases components and builds inventory in advance of product shipments and invests in manufacturing-related assets, including capital assets held at its suppliers’ facilities. In addition, the Company makes prepayments to certain of its suppliers associated with long-term supply agreements to secure supply of inventory. The Company performs a regular review of inventory that considers multiple factors including demand forecasts, product life cycle status, product development plans, current sales levels and component cost trends. If the Company determines inventories of components and products, including third-party products held for resale, have become obsolete or are in excess of anticipated demand or net realizable value, it records a write-down of the inventories. The Company also reviews its manufacturing-related capital assets and inventory prepayments for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. If the Company determines that an asset is not recoverable, it records an impairment loss equal to the amount by which the carrying value of such an asset exceeds its fair value. Any write-downs and/or impairments the Company may be required to record would adversely affect the Company’s financial condition and operating results.The Company accrues for estimated purchase commitment cancellation fees related to inventory orders that have been canceled or are expected to be canceled. Manufacturing purchase obligations cover the Company’s forecasted component and manufacturing requirements, typically for periods up to 150 days. If there is an abrupt and substantial decline in demand for one or more of the Company’s products, a change in the Company’s product development plans, or an unanticipated change in technological requirements for any of the Company’s products, the Company may be required to record accruals for cancellation fees that would adversely affect its operating results.Warranty CostsThe Company accrues the estimated cost of warranties in the period the related revenue is recognized based on historical and projected warranty claim rates, historical and projected cost per claim and knowledge of specific product failures outside of the Company’s typical experience. The Company regularly reviews these estimates and adjusts the amounts as necessary. If actual product failure rates or repair costs differ from estimates, revisions to the estimated warranty liabilities would be required and could materially affect the Company’s financial condition and operating results.Income TaxesThe Company records a tax provision for the anticipated tax consequences of its reported operating results. The provision for income taxes is computed using the asset and liability method, under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates that will be in effect for the years in which those tax assets and liabilities are expected to be realized or settled. The Company records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is believed more likely than not to be realized.The Company recognizes tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement.Apple Inc. | 2018 Form 10-K | 34


## Item 7A


As of September 29, 2018 and September 30, 2017, the Company had outstanding floating- and fixed-rate notes with varying maturities for an aggregate carrying amount of $102.5 billion and $103.7 billion, respectively. The Company has entered, and in the future may enter, into interest rate swaps to manage interest rate risk on its outstanding term debt. Interest rate swaps allow the Company to effectively convert fixed-rate payments into floating-rate payments or floating-rate payments into fixed-rate payments. Gains and losses on term debt are generally offset by the corresponding losses and gains on the related hedging instrument. A 100 basis point increase in market interest rates would cause interest expense on the Company’s debt as of September 29, 2018 and September 30, 2017 to increase by $399 million and $376 million on an annualized basis, respectively.Further details regarding the Company’s debt is provided in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Note 5, “Debt.”Foreign Currency RiskIn general, the Company is a net receiver of currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Accordingly, changes in exchange rates, and in particular a strengthening of the U.S. dollar, will negatively affect the Company’s net sales and gross margins as expressed in U.S. dollars. There is a risk that the Company will have to adjust local currency product pricing due to competitive pressures when there has been significant volatility in foreign currency exchange rates.The Company may enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts with financial institutions to protect against foreign exchange risks associated with certain existing assets and liabilities, certain firmly committed transactions, forecasted future cash flows and net investments in foreign subsidiaries. In addition, the Company has entered, and in the future may enter, into foreign currency contracts to partially offset the foreign currency exchange gains and losses on its foreign currency–denominated debt issuances. The Company generally hedges portions of its forecasted foreign currency exposure associated with revenue and inventory purchases, typically for up to 12 months. However, the Company may choose not to hedge certain foreign exchange exposures for a variety of reasons including, but not limited to, accounting considerations or the prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures.To provide a meaningful assessment of the foreign currency risk associated with certain of the Company’s foreign currency derivative positions, the Company performed a sensitivity analysis using a value-at-risk (“VAR”) model to assess the potential impact of fluctuations in exchange rates. The VAR model consisted of using a Monte Carlo simulation to generate thousands of random market price paths assuming normal market conditions. The VAR is the maximum expected loss in fair value, for a given confidence interval, to the Company’s foreign currency derivative positions due to adverse movements in rates. The VAR model is not intended to represent actual losses but is used as a risk estimation and management tool. Forecasted transactions, firm commitments and assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies were excluded from the model. Based on the results of the model, the Company estimates with 95% confidence, a maximum one-day loss in fair value of $592 million as of September 29, 2018 compared to a maximum one-day loss in fair value of $485 million as of September 30, 2017. Because the Company uses foreign currency instruments for hedging purposes, the losses in fair value incurred on those instruments are generally offset by increases in the fair value of the underlying exposures.Actual future gains and losses associated with the Company’s investment portfolio, debt and derivative positions may differ materially from the sensitivity analyses performed as of September 29, 2018 due to the inherent limitations associated with predicting the timing and amount of changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and the Company’s actual exposures and positions.Apple Inc. | 2018 Form 10-K | 36

The Company sells to consumers, small and mid-sized businesses and education, enterprise and government customers.Basis of Presentation and PreparationThe accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company. Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. In the opinion of the Company’s management, the consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments, which are normal and recurring in nature, necessary for fair financial statement presentation. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates. Certain prior period amounts in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been reclassified to conform to the current period’s presentation.The Company’s fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week period that ends on the last Saturday of September. The Company’s fiscal years 2018 and 2016 spanned 52 weeks each, whereas fiscal year 2017 included 53 weeks. A 14th week was included in the first fiscal quarter of 2017, as is done every five or six years, to realign the Company’s fiscal quarters with calendar quarters. Unless otherwise stated, references to particular years, quarters, months and periods refer to the Company’s fiscal years ended in September and the associated quarters, months and periods of those fiscal years.Revenue RecognitionNet sales consist primarily of revenue from the sale of hardware, software, digital content and applications, accessories, and service and support contracts. The Company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the sales price is fixed or determinable and collection is probable. Product is considered delivered to the customer once it has been shipped and title, risk of loss and rewards of ownership have been transferred. For most of the Company’s product sales, these criteria are met at the time the product is shipped. For online sales to individuals, for some sales to education customers in the U.S., and for certain other sales, the Company defers revenue until the customer receives the product because the Company retains a portion of the risk of loss on these sales during transit. For payment terms in excess of the Company’s standard payment terms, revenue is recognized as payments become due unless the Company has positive evidence that the sales price is fixed or determinable, such as a successful history of collection, without concession, on comparable arrangements. The Company recognizes revenue from the sale of hardware products, software bundled with hardware that is essential to the functionality of the hardware and third-party digital content sold on the iTunes Store in accordance with general revenue recognition accounting guidance. The Company recognizes revenue in accordance with industry-specific software accounting guidance for the following types of sales transactions: (i) standalone sales of software products, (ii) sales of software upgrades and (iii) sales of software bundled with hardware not essential to the functionality of the hardware.For the sale of most third-party products, the Company recognizes revenue based on the gross amount billed to customers because the Company establishes its own pricing for such products, retains related inventory risk for physical products, is the primary obligor to the customer and assumes the credit risk for amounts billed to its customers. For third-party applications sold through the App Store and Mac App Store and certain digital content sold through the iTunes Store, the Company does not determine the selling price of the products and is not the primary obligor to the customer. Therefore, the Company accounts for such sales on a net basis by recognizing in net sales only the commission it retains from each sale. The portion of the gross amount billed to customers that is remitted by the Company to third-party app developers and certain digital content owners is not reflected in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Operations.Apple Inc. | 2018 Form 10-K | 43



The Company records deferred revenue when it receives payments in advance of the delivery of products or the performance of services. This includes amounts that have been deferred for unspecified and specified software upgrade rights and non-software services that are attached to hardware and software products. The Company sells gift cards redeemable at its retail and online stores, and also sells gift cards redeemable on iTunes Store, App Store, Mac App Store, TV App Store and Book Store for the purchase of digital content and software. The Company records deferred revenue upon the sale of the card, which is relieved upon redemption of the card by the customer. Revenue from AppleCare service and support contracts is deferred and recognized over the service coverage periods. AppleCare service and support contracts typically include extended phone support, repair services, web-based support resources and diagnostic tools offered under the Company’s standard limited warranty.The Company records reductions to revenue for estimated commitments related to price protection and other customer incentive programs. For transactions involving price protection, the Company recognizes revenue net of the estimated amount to be refunded. For the Company’s other customer incentive programs, the estimated cost of these programs is recognized at the later of the date at which the Company has sold the product or the date at which the program is offered. The Company also records reductions to revenue for expected future product returns based on the Company’s historical experience. Revenue is recorded net of taxes collected from customers that are remitted to governmental authorities, with the collected taxes recorded as current liabilities until remitted to the relevant government authority.Revenue Recognition for Arrangements with Multiple DeliverablesFor multi-element arrangements that include hardware products containing software essential to the hardware product’s functionality, undelivered software elements that relate to the hardware product’s essential software, and undelivered non-software services, the Company allocates revenue to all deliverables based on their relative selling prices. In such circumstances, the Company uses a hierarchy to determine the selling price to be used for allocating revenue to deliverables: (i) vendor-specific objective evidence of fair value (“VSOE”), (ii) third-party evidence of selling price (“TPE”) and (iii) best estimate of selling price (“ESP”). VSOE generally exists only when the Company sells the deliverable separately and is the price actually charged by the Company for that deliverable. ESPs reflect the Company’s best estimates of what the selling prices of elements would be if they were sold regularly on a stand-alone basis. For multi-element arrangements accounted for in accordance with industry-specific software accounting guidance, the Company allocates revenue to all deliverables based on the VSOE of each element, and if VSOE does not exist revenue is recognized when elements lacking VSOE are delivered.For sales of iPhone, iPad, Mac and certain other products, the Company has indicated it may from time to time provide future unspecified software upgrades to the device’s essential software and/or non-software services free of charge. The Company has identified up to three deliverables regularly included in arrangements involving the sale of these devices. The first deliverable, which represents the substantial portion of the allocated sales price, is the hardware and software essential to the functionality of the hardware device delivered at the time of sale. The second deliverable is the embedded right included with qualifying devices to receive, on a when-and-if-available basis, future unspecified software upgrades relating to the product’s essential software. The third deliverable is the non-software services to be provided to qualifying devices. The Company allocates revenue between these deliverables using the relative selling price method. Because the Company has neither VSOE nor TPE for these deliverables, the allocation of revenue is based on the Company’s ESPs. Revenue allocated to the delivered hardware and the related essential software is recognized at the time of sale, provided the other conditions for revenue recognition have been met. Revenue allocated to the embedded unspecified software upgrade rights and the non-software services is deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis over the estimated period the software upgrades and non-software services are expected to be provided. Cost of sales related to delivered hardware and related essential software, including estimated warranty costs, are recognized at the time of sale. Costs incurred to provide non-software services are recognized as cost of sales as incurred, and engineering and sales and marketing costs are recognized as operating expenses as incurred.The Company’s process for determining its ESP for deliverables without VSOE or TPE considers multiple factors that may vary depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each deliverable including, where applicable, prices charged by the Company and market trends in the pricing for similar offerings, product-specific business objectives, estimated cost to provide the non-software services and the relative ESP of the upgrade rights and non-software services as compared to the total selling price of the product.Shipping CostsAmounts billed to customers related to shipping and handling are classified as revenue, and the Company’s shipping and handling costs are classified as cost of sales.Advertising CostsAdvertising costs are expensed as incurred and included in selling, general and administrative expenses.Apple Inc. | 2018 Form 10-K | 44

Share-Based CompensationThe Company generally measures share-based compensation based on the closing price of the Company’s common stock on the date of grant, and recognizes expense on a straight-line basis for its estimate of equity awards that will ultimately vest. Further information regarding share-based compensation can be found in Note 8, “Benefit Plans.”During the first quarter of 2018, the Company adopted the Financial Accounting Standards Board’s (the “FASB”) Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2016-09, Compensation – Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting (“ASU 2016-09”), which modified certain aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including income taxes, classification of awards and classification in the statement of cash flows. Historically, excess tax benefits or deficiencies from the Company’s equity awards were recorded as additional paid-in capital in its Consolidated Balance Sheets and were classified as a financing activity in its Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Beginning in 2018, the Company records any excess tax benefits or deficiencies from its equity awards as part of the provision for income taxes in its Consolidated Statements of Operations in the reporting periods in which equity vesting occurs. The Company elected to apply the cash flow classification requirements related to excess tax benefits retrospectively to all periods presented, which resulted in an increase to cash generated by operating activities in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows of $627 million and $407 million for 2017 and 2016, respectively.Earnings Per ShareThe following table shows the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share for 2018, 2017 and 2016 (net income in millions and shares in thousands):Cash Equivalents and Marketable SecuritiesAll highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase are classified as cash equivalents. The Company’s marketable debt and equity securities have been classified and accounted for as available-for-sale. The Company classifies its marketable debt securities as either short-term or long-term based on each instrument’s underlying contractual maturity date. Marketable equity securities, including mutual funds, are classified as short-term based on the nature of the securities and their availability for use in current operations. The cost of securities sold is determined using the specific identification method.InventoriesInventories are computed using the first-in, first-out method.Property, Plant and EquipmentDepreciation on property, plant and equipment is recognized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which for buildings is the lesser of 30 years or the remaining life of the underlying building; between one and five years for machinery and equipment, including product tooling and manufacturing process equipment; and the shorter of lease term or useful life for leasehold improvements. Capitalized costs related to internal-use software are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which range from three to five years. Depreciation and amortization expense on property and equipment was $9.3 billion, $8.2 billion and $8.3 billion during 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.During 2018, non-cash investing activities involving property, plant and equipment resulted in a net increase to accounts payable and other current liabilities of $3.4 billion.Apple Inc. | 2018 Form 10-K | 45

Fair Value MeasurementsThe Company’s valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of money market funds and certain marketable equity securities are derived from quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. The valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of the Company’s debt instruments and all other financial instruments, which generally have counterparties with high credit ratings, are based on quoted market prices or model-driven valuations using significant inputs derived from or corroborated by observable market data.Note 2 – Financial InstrumentsCash, Cash Equivalents and Marketable SecuritiesThe following tables show the Company’s cash and available-for-sale securities by significant investment category as of September 29, 2018 and September 30, 2017 (in millions):Apple Inc. | 2018 Form 10-K | 46

The Company may sell certain of its marketable securities prior to their stated maturities for reasons including, but not limited to, managing liquidity, credit risk, duration and asset allocation. The maturities of the Company’s long-term marketable securities generally range from one to five years.The following tables show information about the Company’s marketable securities that had been in a continuous unrealized loss position for less than 12 months and for 12 months or greater as of September 29, 2018 and September 30, 2017 (in millions):Apple Inc. | 2018 Form 10-K | 47



The Company typically invests in highly rated securities, with the primary objective of minimizing the potential risk of principal loss. The Company’s investment policy generally requires securities to be investment grade and limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. Fair values were determined for each individual security in the investment portfolio. When evaluating an investment for other-than-temporary impairment, the Company reviews factors such as the length of time and extent to which fair value has been below its cost basis, the financial condition of the issuer and any changes thereto, changes in market interest rates and the Company’s intent to sell, or whether it is more likely than not it will be required to sell the investment before recovery of the investment’s cost basis. As of September 29, 2018, the Company does not consider any of its investments to be other-than-temporarily impaired.Derivative Financial InstrumentsThe Company may use derivatives to partially offset its business exposure to foreign currency and interest rate risk on expected future cash flows, net investments in certain foreign subsidiaries, and certain existing assets and liabilities. However, the Company may choose not to hedge certain exposures for a variety of reasons including, but not limited to, accounting considerations or the prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures. There can be no assurance the hedges will offset more than a portion of the financial impact resulting from movements in foreign currency exchange or interest rates.To protect gross margins from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, certain of the Company’s subsidiaries whose functional currency is the U.S. dollar may hedge a portion of forecasted foreign currency revenue, and subsidiaries whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar may hedge a portion of forecasted inventory purchases not denominated in the subsidiaries’ functional currencies. The Company may enter into forward contracts, option contracts or other instruments to manage this risk and may designate these instruments as cash flow hedges. The Company generally hedges portions of its forecasted foreign currency exposure associated with revenue and inventory purchases, typically for up to 12 months.To protect the net investment in a foreign operation from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, the Company may enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts to offset a portion of the changes in the carrying amounts of these investments due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. In addition, the Company may use non-derivative financial instruments, such as its foreign currency–denominated debt, as hedges of its net investments in certain foreign subsidiaries. In both of these cases, the Company designates these instruments as net investment hedges.To protect the Company’s foreign currency–denominated term debt or marketable securities from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, the Company may enter into forward contracts, cross-currency swaps or other instruments. These instruments may offset a portion of the foreign currency remeasurement gains or losses, or changes in fair value. The Company may designate these instruments as either cash flow or fair value hedges. As of September 29, 2018, the Company’s hedged term debt– and marketable securities–related foreign currency transactions are expected to be recognized within 24 years.The Company may also enter into non-designated foreign currency contracts to offset a portion of the foreign currency exchange gains and losses generated by the remeasurement of certain assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies.To protect the Company’s foreign currency–denominated term debt or marketable securities from fluctuations in interest rates, the Company may enter into interest rate swaps, options or other instruments. These instruments may offset a portion of the changes in interest income or expense, or changes in fair value. The Company designates these instruments as either cash flow or fair value hedges. As of September 29, 2018, the Company’s hedged interest rate transactions are expected to be recognized within 9 years.Cash Flow HedgesThe effective portions of cash flow hedges are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss) (“AOCI”) until the hedged item is recognized in earnings. Deferred gains and losses associated with cash flow hedges of foreign currency revenue are recognized as a component of net sales in the same period as the related revenue is recognized, and deferred gains and losses related to cash flow hedges of inventory purchases are recognized as a component of cost of sales in the same period as the related costs are recognized. Deferred gains and losses associated with cash flow hedges of interest income or expense are recognized in other income/(expense), net in the same period as the related income or expense is recognized. For options designated as cash flow hedges, changes in the time value are excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness. The ineffective portions and amounts excluded from the effectiveness testing of cash flow hedges are recognized in other income/(expense), net.Derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges must be de-designated as hedges when it is probable the forecasted hedged transaction will not occur in the initially identified time period or within a subsequent two-month time period. Deferred gains and losses in AOCI associated with such derivative instruments are reclassified into other income/(expense), net in the period of de-designation. Any subsequent changes in fair value of such derivative instruments are reflected in other income/(expense), net unless they are re-designated as hedges of other transactions.Apple Inc. | 2018 Form 10-K | 48

Net Investment HedgesThe effective portions of net investment hedges are recorded in other comprehensive income/(loss) (“OCI”) as a part of the cumulative translation adjustment. The ineffective portions and amounts excluded from the effectiveness testing of net investment hedges are recognized in other income/(expense), net. For forward exchange contracts designated as net investment hedges, the Company excludes changes in fair value relating to changes in the forward carry component from its definition of effectiveness. Accordingly, any gains or losses related to this forward carry component are recognized in earnings in the current period.Fair Value HedgesGains and losses related to changes in fair value hedges are recognized in earnings along with a corresponding loss or gain related to the change in value of the underlying hedged item in the same line in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.Non-Designated DerivativesDerivatives that are not designated as hedging instruments are adjusted to fair value through earnings in the financial statement line item to which the derivative relates. As a result, during 2018, the Company recognized a gain of $20 million in net sales, a gain of $85 million in cost of sales and a loss of $198 million in other income/(expense), net. During 2017, the Company recognized a gain of $20 million in net sales, a loss of $40 million in cost of sales and a gain of $606 million in other income/(expense), net.The Company records all derivatives in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value. The Company’s accounting treatment for these derivative instruments is based on its hedge designation. The following tables show the Company’s derivative instruments at gross fair value as of September 29, 2018 and September 30, 2017 (in millions): The Company classifies cash flows related to derivative financial instruments as operating activities in its Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.Apple Inc. | 2018 Form 10-K | 49

The following table shows the pre-tax gains and losses of the Company’s derivative and non-derivative instruments designated as cash flow, net investment and fair value hedges in OCI and the Consolidated Statements of Operations for 2018, 2017 and 2016 (in millions):The following table shows the notional amounts of the Company’s outstanding derivative instruments and credit risk amounts associated with outstanding or unsettled derivative instruments as of September 29, 2018 and September 30, 2017 (in millions):The notional amounts for outstanding derivative instruments provide one measure of the transaction volume outstanding and do not represent the amount of the Company’s exposure to credit or market loss. The credit risk amounts represent the Company’s gross exposure to potential accounting loss on derivative instruments that are outstanding or unsettled if all counterparties failed to perform according to the terms of the contract, based on then-current currency or interest rates at each respective date. The Company’s exposure to credit loss and market risk will vary over time as currency and interest rates change. Although the table above reflects the notional and credit risk amounts of the Company’s derivative instruments, it does not reflect the gains or losses associated with the exposures and transactions that the instruments are intended to hedge. The amounts ultimately realized upon settlement of these financial instruments, together with the gains and losses on the underlying exposures, will depend on actual market conditions during the remaining life of the instruments.Apple Inc. | 2018 Form 10-K | 50

The Company generally enters into master netting arrangements, which are designed to reduce credit risk by permitting net settlement of transactions with the same counterparty. To further limit credit risk, the Company generally enters into collateral security arrangements that provide for collateral to be received or posted when the net fair value of certain financial instruments fluctuates from contractually established thresholds. The Company presents its derivative assets and derivative liabilities at their gross fair values in its Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of September 29, 2018, the net cash collateral posted by the Company related to derivative instruments under its collateral security arrangements was $1.0 billion, which was recorded as other current assets in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet. As of September 30, 2017, the net cash collateral received by the Company related to derivative instruments under its collateral security arrangements was $35 million, which was recorded as other current liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.Under master netting arrangements with the respective counterparties to the Company’s derivative contracts, the Company is allowed to net settle transactions with a single net amount payable by one party to the other. As of September 29, 2018 and September 30, 2017, the potential effects of these rights of set-off associated with the Company’s derivative contracts, including the effects of collateral, would be a reduction to both derivative assets and derivative liabilities of $2.1 billion and $1.4 billion, respectively, resulting in net derivative assets of $138 million and $32 million, respectively.Accounts ReceivableTrade ReceivablesThe Company has considerable trade receivables outstanding with its third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers, resellers, small and mid-sized businesses and education, enterprise and government customers. The Company generally does not require collateral from its customers; however, the Company will require collateral or third-party credit support in certain instances to limit credit risk. In addition, when possible, the Company attempts to limit credit risk on trade receivables with credit insurance for certain customers or by requiring third-party financing, loans or leases to support credit exposure. These credit-financing arrangements are directly between the third-party financing company and the end customer. As such, the Company generally does not assume any recourse or credit risk sharing related to any of these arrangements.As of September 29, 2018, the Company had one customer that represented 10% or more of total trade receivables, which accounted for 10%. As of September 30, 2017, the Company had two customers that individually represented 10% or more of total trade receivables, each of which accounted for 10%. The Company’s cellular network carriers accounted for 59% of total trade receivables as of both September 29, 2018 and September 30, 2017.Vendor Non-Trade ReceivablesThe Company has non-trade receivables from certain of its manufacturing vendors resulting from the sale of components to these vendors who manufacture sub-assemblies or assemble final products for the Company. The Company purchases these components directly from suppliers. As of September 29, 2018, the Company had two vendors that individually represented 10% or more of total vendor non-trade receivables, which accounted for 62% and 12%. As of September 30, 2017, the Company had three vendors that individually represented 10% or more of total vendor non-trade receivables, which accounted for 42%, 19% and 10%.Note 3 – Consolidated Financial Statement DetailsThe following tables show the Company’s consolidated financial statement details as of September 29, 2018 and September 30, 2017 (in millions):Property, Plant and Equipment, NetApple Inc. | 2018 Form 10-K | 51

Other Non-Current LiabilitiesOther Income/(Expense), NetThe following table shows the detail of other income/(expense), net for 2018, 2017 and 2016 (in millions):Note 4 – Income TaxesU.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs ActOn December 22, 2017, the U.S. enacted the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Act”), which significantly changed U.S. tax law. The Act lowered the Company’s U.S. statutory federal income tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018, while also imposing a deemed repatriation tax on previously deferred foreign income. The Act also created a new minimum tax on certain future foreign earnings. The impact of the Act increased the Company’s provision for income taxes by $1.5 billion during 2018. This increase was composed of $2.0 billion related to the remeasurement of net deferred tax assets and liabilities and $1.2 billion associated with the deemed repatriation tax, partially offset by a $1.7 billion impact the deemed repatriation tax had on the Company’s unrecognized tax benefits.Deferred Tax BalancesAs a result of the Act, the Company remeasured certain deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the revised rates at which they are expected to reverse, including items for which the related income tax effects were originally recognized in OCI. In addition, the Company elected to record certain deferred tax assets and liabilities related to the new minimum tax on certain future foreign earnings. Of the $2.0 billion recognized related to the remeasurement of net deferred tax assets and liabilities, $1.2 billion is a provisional estimate that incorporates assumptions based upon the most recent interpretations of the Act and may change as the Company continues to analyze the impact of additional implementation guidance. The Company’s provisional estimates are in accordance with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118.Deemed Repatriation TaxAs of September 30, 2017, the Company had a U.S. deferred tax liability of $36.4 billion for deferred foreign income. During 2018, the Company replaced $36.1 billion of its U.S. deferred tax liability with a deemed repatriation tax payable of $37.3 billion, which was based on the Company’s cumulative post-1986 deferred foreign income. The deemed repatriation tax payable is a provisional estimate that may change as the Company continues to analyze the impact of additional implementation guidance. The Company plans to pay the tax in installments in accordance with the Act.Adoption of ASU No. 2018-02During the second quarter of 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-02, Income Statement – Reporting Comprehensive Income (Topic 220): Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (“ASU 2018-02”). ASU 2018-02 allows an entity to elect to reclassify the income tax effects of the Act on items within AOCI to retained earnings. The Company elected to apply the provision of ASU 2018-02 in 2018 with a reclassification of net tax benefits related to cumulative foreign currency translation and unrealized gains/losses on derivative instruments and marketable securities, resulting in a $278 million decrease in AOCI and a corresponding increase in retained earnings in the Consolidated Balance Sheet and Consolidated Statement of Shareholders’ Equity.Apple Inc. | 2018 Form 10-K | 52

Provision for Income Taxes and Effective Tax RateThe provision for income taxes for 2018, 2017 and 2016, consisted of the following (in millions):The foreign provision for income taxes is based on foreign pre-tax earnings of $48.0 billion, $44.7 billion and $41.1 billion in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.A reconciliation of the provision for income taxes, with the amount computed by applying the statutory federal income tax rate (24.5% in 2018; 35% in 2017 and 2016) to income before provision for income taxes for 2018, 2017 and 2016, is as follows (dollars in millions):The Company’s income taxes payable have been reduced by the tax benefits from employee stock plan awards. For restricted stock units (“RSUs”), the Company receives an income tax benefit upon the award’s vesting equal to the tax effect of the underlying stock’s fair market value. Prior to adopting ASU 2016-09 in the first quarter of 2018, the Company reflected net excess tax benefits from equity awards as increases to additional paid-in capital, which amounted to $620 million and $379 million in 2017 and 2016, respectively.

Deferred Tax Assets and LiabilitiesAs of September 29, 2018 and September 30, 2017, the significant components of the Company’s deferred tax assets and liabilities were (in millions):Deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect the effects of tax losses, credits and the future income tax effects of temporary differences between the consolidated financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and are measured using enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.Uncertain Tax PositionsAs of September 29, 2018, the total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits was $9.7 billion, of which $7.4 billion, if recognized, would impact the Company’s effective tax rate. As of September 30, 2017, the total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits was $8.4 billion, of which $2.5 billion, if recognized, would have impacted the Company’s effective tax rate.The aggregate changes in the balance of gross unrecognized tax benefits, which excludes interest and penalties, for 2018, 2017 and 2016, is as follows (in millions):The Company includes interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within the provision for income taxes. As of September 29, 2018 and September 30, 2017, the total amount of gross interest and penalties accrued was $1.4 billion and $1.2 billion, respectively. Both the unrecognized tax benefits and the associated interest and penalties that are not expected to result in payment or receipt of cash within one year are classified as other non-current liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. In connection with tax matters, the Company recognized interest and penalty expense in 2018, 2017 and 2016 of $236 million, $165 million and $295 million, respectively.Apple Inc. | 2018 Form 10-K | 54

The Company is subject to taxation and files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and in many state and foreign jurisdictions. The U.S. Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”) concluded its review of the years 2013 through 2015 in 2018, and all years prior to 2016 are closed. Tax years subsequent to 2006 in certain major U.S. states and subsequent to 2007 in certain major foreign jurisdictions remain open, and could be subject to examination by the taxing authorities. The Company believes that an adequate provision has been made for any adjustments that may result from tax examinations. However, the outcome of tax audits cannot be predicted with certainty. If any issues addressed in the Company’s tax audits are resolved in a manner inconsistent with its expectations, the Company could be required to adjust its provision for income taxes in the period such resolution occurs. Although timing of resolution and/or closure of audits is not certain, the Company believes it is reasonably possible that its gross unrecognized tax benefits could decrease (either by payment, release or a combination of both) in the next 12 months by as much as $800 million.European Commission State Aid DecisionOn August 30, 2016, the European Commission announced its decision that Ireland granted state aid to the Company by providing tax opinions in 1991 and 2007 concerning the tax allocation of profits of the Irish branches of two subsidiaries of the Company (the “State Aid Decision”). The State Aid Decision ordered Ireland to calculate and recover additional taxes from the Company for the period June 2003 through December 2014. The recovery amount was calculated to be €13.1 billion, plus interest of €1.2 billion. Irish legislative changes, effective as of January 2015, eliminated the application of the tax opinions from that date forward. The Company believes the State Aid Decision to be without merit and appealed to the General Court of the Court of Justice of the European Union. Ireland has also appealed the State Aid Decision. The Company believes that any incremental Irish corporate income taxes potentially due related to the State Aid Decision would be creditable against U.S. taxes, subject to any foreign tax credit limitations in the Act. As of September 29, 2018, the entire recovery amount plus interest was funded into escrow, where it will remain restricted from general use pending conclusion of all appeals. Refer to Note 2, “Financial Instruments” for more information.Note 5 – DebtCommercial PaperThe Company issues unsecured short-term promissory notes (“Commercial Paper”) pursuant to a commercial paper program. The Company uses net proceeds from the commercial paper program for general corporate purposes, including dividends and share repurchases. As of both September 29, 2018 and September 30, 2017, the Company had $12.0 billion of Commercial Paper outstanding with maturities generally less than nine months. The weighted-average interest rate of the Company’s Commercial Paper was 2.18% as of September 29, 2018 and 1.20% as of September 30, 2017.

The following table provides a summary of the Company’s term debt as of September 29, 2018 and September 30, 2017:To manage interest rate risk on certain of its U.S. dollar–denominated fixed- or floating-rate notes, the Company has entered into interest rate swaps to effectively convert the fixed interest rates to floating interest rates or the floating interest rates to fixed interest rates on a portion of these notes. Additionally, to manage foreign currency risk on certain of its foreign currency–denominated notes, the Company has entered into foreign currency swaps to effectively convert these notes to U.S. dollar–denominated notes.A portion of the Company’s Japanese yen–denominated notes is designated as a hedge of the foreign currency exposure of the Company’s net investment in a foreign operation. As of September 29, 2018 and September 30, 2017, the carrying value of the debt designated as a net investment hedge was $811 million and $1.6 billion, respectively. For further discussion regarding the Company’s use of derivative instruments, refer to the Derivative Financial Instruments section of Note 2, “Financial Instruments.”The effective interest rates for the Notes include the interest on the Notes, amortization of the discount or premium and, if applicable, adjustments related to hedging.

The following table shows the changes in AOCI by component for 2018 and 2017 (in millions):Note 8 – Benefit Plans2014 Employee Stock PlanIn the second quarter of 2014, shareholders approved the 2014 Employee Stock Plan (the “2014 Plan”) and terminated the Company’s authority to grant new awards under the 2003 Employee Stock Plan (the “2003 Plan”). The 2014 Plan provides for broad-based equity grants to employees, including executive officers, and permits the granting of RSUs, stock grants, performance-based awards, stock options and stock appreciation rights, as well as cash bonus awards. RSUs granted under the 2014 Plan generally vest over four years, based on continued employment, and are settled upon vesting in shares of the Company’s common stock on a one-for-one basis. Each share issued with respect to RSUs granted under the 2014 Plan reduces the number of shares available for grant under the plan by two shares. RSUs canceled and shares withheld to satisfy tax withholding obligations increase the number of shares available for grant under the 2014 Plan utilizing a factor of two times the number of RSUs canceled or shares withheld. Currently, all RSUs granted under the 2014 Plan have dividend equivalent rights (“DERs”), which entitle holders of RSUs to the same dividend value per share as holders of common stock. DERs are subject to the same vesting and other terms and conditions as the corresponding unvested RSUs. DERs are accumulated and paid when the underlying shares vest. Upon approval of the 2014 Plan, the Company reserved 385 million shares plus the number of shares remaining that were reserved but not issued under the 2003 Plan. Shares subject to outstanding awards under the 2003 Plan that expire, are canceled or otherwise terminate, or are withheld to satisfy tax withholding obligations with respect to RSUs, will also be available for awards under the 2014 Plan. As of September 29, 2018, approximately 280.2 million shares were reserved for future issuance under the 2014 Plan.Apple Inc. Non-Employee Director Stock PlanThe Apple Inc. Non-Employee Director Stock Plan (the “Director Plan”) is a shareholder-approved plan that (i) permits the Company to grant awards of RSUs or stock options to the Company’s non-employee directors, (ii) provides for automatic initial grants of RSUs upon a non-employee director joining the Board of Directors and automatic annual grants of RSUs at each annual meeting of shareholders, and (iii) permits the Board of Directors to prospectively change the value and relative mixture of stock options and RSUs for the initial and annual award grants and the methodology for determining the number of shares of the Company’s common stock subject to these grants, in each case within the limits set forth in the Director Plan and without further shareholder approval. Each share issued with respect to RSUs granted under the Director Plan reduces the number of shares available for grant under the plan by two shares. The Director Plan expires November 12, 2027. All RSUs granted under the Director Plan are entitled to DERs. DERs are subject to the same vesting and other terms and conditions as the corresponding unvested RSUs. DERs are accumulated and paid when the underlying shares vest. As of September 29, 2018, approximately 1.1 million shares were reserved for future issuance under the Director Plan.Apple Inc. | 2018 Form 10-K | 58

Rule 10b5-1 Trading PlansDuring the three months ended September 29, 2018, Section 16 officers Angela Ahrendts, Timothy D. Cook, Chris Kondo, Luca Maestri, Daniel Riccio, Philip Schiller and Jeffrey Williams had equity trading plans in place in accordance with Rule 10b5-1(c)(1) under the Exchange Act. An equity trading plan is a written document that pre-establishes the amounts, prices and dates (or formula for determining the amounts, prices and dates) of future purchases or sales of the Company’s stock, including shares acquired pursuant to the Company’s employee and director equity plans.Employee Stock Purchase PlanThe Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the “Purchase Plan”) is a shareholder-approved plan under which substantially all employees may purchase the Company’s common stock through payroll deductions at a price equal to 85% of the lower of the fair market values of the stock as of the beginning or the end of six-month offering periods. An employee’s payroll deductions under the Purchase Plan are limited to 10% of the employee’s compensation and employees may not purchase more than $25,000 of stock during any calendar year. As of September 29, 2018, approximately 36.5 million shares were reserved for future issuance under the Purchase Plan.401(k) PlanThe Company’s 401(k) Plan is a deferred salary arrangement under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code. Under the 401(k) Plan, participating U.S. employees may defer a portion of their pre-tax earnings, up to the IRS annual contribution limit ($18,500 for calendar year 2018). The Company matches 50% to 100% of each employee’s contributions, depending on length of service, up to a maximum 6% of the employee’s eligible earnings.Restricted Stock UnitsA summary of the Company’s RSU activity and related information for 2018, 2017 and 2016, is as follows:The fair value as of the respective vesting dates of RSUs was $7.6 billion, $6.1 billion and $5.1 billion for 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The majority of RSUs that vested in 2018, 2017 and 2016 were net share settled such that the Company withheld shares with value equivalent to the employees’ obligation for the applicable income and other employment taxes, and remitted the cash to the appropriate taxing authorities. The total shares withheld were approximately 16.0 million, 15.4 million and 15.9 million for 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively, and were based on the value of the RSUs on their respective vesting dates as determined by the Company’s closing stock price. Total payments for the employees’ tax obligations to taxing authorities were $2.7 billion, $2.0 billion and $1.7 billion in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively, and are reflected as a financing activity within the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. These net share settlements had the effect of share repurchases by the Company as they reduced the number of shares that would have otherwise been issued as a result of the vesting and did not represent an expense to the Company.Apple Inc. | 2018 Form 10-K | 59

Share-Based CompensationThe following table shows a summary of the share-based compensation expense included in the Consolidated Statements of Operations for 2018, 2017 and 2016 (in millions):The income tax benefit related to share-based compensation expense was $1.9 billion, $1.6 billion and $1.4 billion for 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. As of September 29, 2018, the total unrecognized compensation cost related to outstanding RSUs and stock options was $9.4 billion, which the Company expects to recognize over a weighted-average period of 2.5 years.Note 9 – Commitments and ContingenciesAccrued Warranty and IndemnificationThe following table shows changes in the Company’s accrued warranties and related costs for 2018, 2017 and 2016 (in millions):Agreements entered into by the Company may include indemnification provisions which may subject the Company to costs and damages in the event of a claim against an indemnified third party. Except as disclosed under the heading “Contingencies” below, in the opinion of management, there was not at least a reasonable possibility the Company may have incurred a material loss, or a material loss in excess of a recorded accrual, with respect to indemnification of third parties.The Company offers an iPhone Upgrade Program, which is available to customers who purchase a qualifying iPhone in the U.S., the U.K. and mainland China. The iPhone Upgrade Program provides customers the right to trade in that iPhone for a specified amount when purchasing a new iPhone, provided certain conditions are met. The Company accounts for the trade-in right as a guarantee liability and recognizes arrangement revenue net of the fair value of such right, with subsequent changes to the guarantee liability recognized within revenue.The Company has entered into indemnification agreements with its directors and executive officers. Under these agreements, the Company has agreed to indemnify such individuals to the fullest extent permitted by law against liabilities that arise by reason of their status as directors or officers of the Company, and to advance expenses incurred by such individuals in connection with related legal proceedings. It is not possible to determine the maximum potential amount of payments the Company could be required to make under these agreements due to the limited history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each claim. While the Company maintains directors and officers liability insurance coverage, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise.Concentrations in the Available Sources of Supply of Materials and ProductAlthough most components essential to the Company’s business are generally available from multiple sources, certain components are currently obtained from single or limited sources. In addition, the Company competes for various components with other participants in the markets for mobile communication and media devices and personal computers. Therefore, many components used by the Company, including those that are available from multiple sources, are at times subject to industry-wide shortage and significant commodity pricing fluctuations that could materially adversely affect the Company’s financial condition and operating results.Apple Inc. | 2018 Form 10-K | 60

The Company uses some custom components that are not commonly used by its competitors, and new products introduced by the Company often utilize custom components available from only one source. When a component or product uses new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers’ yields have matured or manufacturing capacity has increased. If the Company’s supply of components for a new or existing product were delayed or constrained, or if an outsourcing partner delayed shipments of completed products to the Company, the Company’s financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected. The Company’s business and financial performance could also be materially adversely affected depending on the time required to obtain sufficient quantities from the original source, or to identify and obtain sufficient quantities from an alternative source. Continued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at all, may be affected if suppliers decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the Company’s requirements.The Company has entered into agreements for the supply of many components; however, there can be no guarantee that the Company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms, or at all. Therefore, the Company remains subject to significant risks of supply shortages and price increases that could materially adversely affect its financial condition and operating results.Substantially all of the Company’s hardware products are manufactured by outsourcing partners that are located primarily in Asia, with some Mac computers manufactured in the U.S. and Ireland. A significant concentration of this manufacturing is currently performed by a small number of outsourcing partners, often in single locations. Certain of these outsourcing partners are single-sourced suppliers of components and manufacturers for many of the Company’s products. Although the Company works closely with its outsourcing partners on manufacturing schedules, the Company’s financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected if its outsourcing partners were unable to meet their production commitments. The Company’s manufacturing purchase obligations typically cover its requirements for periods up to 150 days.Other Off–Balance Sheet CommitmentsOperating LeasesThe Company leases various equipment and facilities, including retail space, under noncancelable operating lease arrangements. The Company does not currently utilize any other off–balance sheet financing arrangements. As of September 29, 2018, the Company’s total future minimum lease payments under noncancelable operating leases were $9.6 billion. The Company’s retail store and other facility leases typically have original terms not exceeding 10 years and generally contain multi-year renewal options.Rent expense under all operating leases, including both cancelable and noncancelable leases, was $1.2 billion, $1.1 billion and $939 million in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Future minimum lease payments under noncancelable operating leases having initial or remaining terms in excess of one year as of September 29, 2018, are as follows (in millions):Unconditional Purchase ObligationsThe Company has entered into certain off–balance sheet arrangements which require the future purchase of goods or services (“unconditional purchase obligations”). The Company’s unconditional purchase obligations primarily consist of payments for supplier arrangements, internet and telecommunication services and intellectual property licenses. Future payments under noncancelable unconditional purchase obligations having a remaining term in excess of one year as of September 29, 2018, are as follows (in millions):Apple Inc. | 2018 Form 10-K | 61



ContingenciesThe Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that have arisen in the ordinary course of business and that have not been fully adjudicated, as further discussed in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K under the heading “Risk Factors” and in Part I, Item 3 of this Form 10-K under the heading “Legal Proceedings.” The outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain. If one or more legal matters were resolved against the Company in a reporting period for amounts in excess of management’s expectations, the Company’s financial condition and operating results for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected. In the opinion of management, there was not at least a reasonable possibility the Company may have incurred a material loss, or a material loss in excess of a recorded accrual, with respect to loss contingencies for asserted legal and other claims, except for the following matters:VirnetXVirnetX, Inc. filed two lawsuits in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas (the “Eastern Texas District Court”) against the Company alleging that certain Company products infringe four patents (the “VirnetX Patents”) relating to network communications technology (“VirnetX I” and “VirnetX II”). On September 30, 2016, a jury returned a verdict in VirnetX I against the Company and awarded damages of $302 million, which later increased to $440 million in post-trial proceedings. VirnetX I is currently on appeal at the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (the “Federal Circuit”). On April 11, 2018, a jury returned a verdict in VirnetX II against the Company and awarded damages of $503 million. VirnetX II is currently on appeal. The Company has challenged the validity of the VirnetX Patents at the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (the “PTO”). In response, the PTO has declared the VirnetX Patents invalid. VirnetX has appealed, and those appeals are currently pending at the Federal Circuit. The Federal Circuit has consolidated the Company’s appeal of the Eastern Texas District Court VirnetX I verdict and VirnetX’s appeals from the PTO invalidity proceedings. The Company believes it will prevail on the merits.QualcommOn January 20, 2017, the Company filed a lawsuit against Qualcomm Incorporated and affiliated parties (“Qualcomm”) in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California seeking, among other things, to enjoin Qualcomm from requiring the Company to pay royalties at the rate demanded by Qualcomm. As the Company does not believe the demanded royalty it has historically paid contract manufacturers for each applicable device is fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory, and believes it to be invalid and/or overstated in other respects as well, no Qualcomm-related royalty payments have been remitted by the Company to its contract manufacturers since the beginning of the second quarter of 2017. The Company believes it will prevail on the merits of the case and has accrued its best estimate for the ultimate resolution of this matter.Note 10 – Segment Information and Geographic DataThe Company reports segment information based on the “management” approach. The management approach designates the internal reporting used by management for making decisions and assessing performance as the source of the Company’s reportable segments.The Company manages its business primarily on a geographic basis. The Company’s reportable segments consist of the Americas, Europe, Greater China, Japan and Rest of Asia Pacific. Americas includes both North and South America. Europe includes European countries, as well as India, the Middle East and Africa. Greater China includes China, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Rest of Asia Pacific includes Australia and those Asian countries not included in the Company’s other reportable segments. Although the reportable segments provide similar hardware and software products and similar services, each one is managed separately to better align with the location of the Company’s customers and distribution partners and the unique market dynamics of each geographic region. The accounting policies of the various segments are the same as those described in Note 1, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.”The Company evaluates the performance of its reportable segments based on net sales and operating income. Net sales for geographic segments are generally based on the location of customers and sales through the Company’s retail stores located in those geographic locations. Operating income for each segment includes net sales to third parties, related cost of sales and operating expenses directly attributable to the segment. Advertising expenses are generally included in the geographic segment in which the expenditures are incurred. Operating income for each segment excludes other income and expense and certain expenses managed outside the reportable segments. Costs excluded from segment operating income include various corporate expenses such as research and development, corporate marketing expenses, certain share-based compensation expenses, income taxes, various nonrecurring charges and other separately managed general and administrative costs. The Company does not include intercompany transfers between segments for management reporting purposes.Apple Inc. | 2018 Form 10-K | 62

A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate./s/ Ernst & Young LLPSan Jose, CaliforniaNovember 5, 2018Apple Inc. | 2018 Form 10-K | 66


# 2019 AAPL

## Item 1A


The Company has a minority market share in the global smartphone, personal computer and tablet markets. The Company faces substantial competition in these markets from companies that have significant technical, marketing, distribution and other resources, as well as established hardware, software and digital content supplier relationships. In addition, some of the Company’s competitors have broader product lines, lower-priced products and a larger installed base of active devices. Competition has been particularly intense as competitors have aggressively cut prices and lowered product margins. Certain competitors may have the resources, experience or cost structures to provide products at little or no profit or even at a loss.Additionally, the Company faces significant competition as competitors imitate the Company’s product features and applications within their products or collaborate to offer solutions that are more competitive than those they currently offer. The Company also expects competition to intensify as competitors imitate the Company’s approach to providing components seamlessly within their offerings or work collaboratively to offer integrated solutions.Some of the markets in which the Company competes have from time to time experienced little to no growth or contracted. In addition, an increasing number of Internet-enabled devices that include software applications and are smaller, simpler and cheaper than traditional personal computers compete with some of the Company’s existing products.The Company’s services also face substantial competition, including from companies that have significant resources and experience and have established service offerings with large customer bases. The Company competes with business models that provide content to users for free. The Company also competes with illegitimate means to obtain third-party digital content and applications.The Company’s financial condition and operating results depend substantially on the Company’s ability to continually improve its products and services to maintain their functional and design advantages. There can be no assurance the Company will be able to continue to provide products and services that compete effectively.To remain competitive and stimulate customer demand, the Company must successfully manage frequent introductions and transitions of products and services.Due to the highly volatile and competitive nature of the industries in which the Company competes, the Company must continually introduce new products, services and technologies, enhance existing products and services, effectively stimulate customer demand for new and upgraded products and services, and successfully manage the transition to these new and upgraded products and services. The success of new product and service introductions depends on a number of factors including, but not limited to, timely and successful development, market acceptance, the Company’s ability to manage the risks associated with new product production ramp-up issues, the availability of application software for new products, the effective management of purchase commitments and inventory levels in line with anticipated product demand, the availability of products in appropriate quantities and at expected costs to meet anticipated demand, and the risk that new products and services may have quality or other defects or deficiencies. Accordingly, the Company cannot determine in advance the ultimate effect of new product and service introductions and transitions.The Company depends on the performance of carriers, wholesalers, retailers and other resellers.The Company distributes its products through cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers and resellers, many of whom distribute products from competing manufacturers. The Company also sells its products and resells third-party products in most of its major markets directly to consumers, small and mid-sized businesses, and education, enterprise and government customers through its retail and online stores and its direct sales force.Some carriers providing cellular network service for iPhone offer financing, installment payment plans or subsidies for users’ purchases of the device. There is no assurance that such offers will be continued at all or in the same amounts upon renewal of the Company’s agreements with these carriers or in agreements the Company enters into with new carriers.The Company has invested and will continue to invest in programs to enhance reseller sales, including staffing selected resellers’ stores with Company employees and contractors, and improving product placement displays. These programs can require a substantial investment while not assuring return or incremental sales. The financial condition of these resellers could weaken, these resellers could stop distributing the Company’s products, or uncertainty regarding demand for some or all of the Company’s products could cause resellers to reduce their ordering and marketing of the Company’s products.Apple Inc. | 2019 Form 10-K | 6



The Company is exposed to the risk of write-downs on the value of its inventory and other assets, in addition to purchase commitment cancellation risk.The Company records a write-down for product and component inventories that have become obsolete or exceed anticipated demand, or for which cost exceeds net realizable value. The Company also accrues necessary cancellation fee reserves for orders of excess products and components. The Company reviews long-lived assets, including capital assets held at its suppliers’ facilities and inventory prepayments, for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate the assets may not be recoverable. If the Company determines that an impairment has occurred, it records a write-down equal to the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value. Although the Company believes its inventory, capital assets, inventory prepayments and other assets and purchase commitments are currently recoverable, no assurance can be given that the Company will not incur write-downs, fees, impairments and other charges given the rapid and unpredictable pace of product obsolescence in the industries in which the Company competes.The Company orders components for its products and builds inventory in advance of product announcements and shipments. Manufacturing purchase obligations cover the Company’s forecasted component and manufacturing requirements, typically for periods up to 150 days. Because the Company’s markets are volatile, competitive and subject to rapid technology and price changes, there is a risk the Company will forecast incorrectly and order or produce excess or insufficient amounts of components or products, or not fully utilize firm purchase commitments.Future operating results depend upon the Company’s ability to obtain components in sufficient quantities on commercially reasonable terms.Because the Company currently obtains certain components from single or limited sources, the Company is subject to significant supply and pricing risks. Many components, including those that are available from multiple sources, are at times subject to industry-wide shortages and significant commodity pricing fluctuations that could materially adversely affect the Company’s financial condition and operating results. While the Company has entered into agreements for the supply of many components, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms, or at all. Component suppliers may suffer from poor financial conditions, which can lead to business failure for the supplier or consolidation within a particular industry, further limiting the Company’s ability to obtain sufficient quantities of components on commercially reasonable terms. The effects of global or regional economic conditions on the Company’s suppliers, described in “Global and regional economic conditions could materially adversely affect the Company’s business, results of operations, financial condition and growth,” above, also could affect the Company’s ability to obtain components. Therefore, the Company remains subject to significant risks of supply shortages and price increases that could materially adversely affect its financial condition and operating results.The Company’s new products often utilize custom components available from only one source. When a component or product uses new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers’ yields have matured or their manufacturing capacities have increased. The continued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at all, can be affected for any number of reasons, including if suppliers decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the Company’s requirements. If the Company’s supply of components for a new or existing product were delayed or constrained, or if an outsourcing partner delayed shipments of completed products to the Company, the Company’s financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected. The Company’s business and financial performance could also be materially adversely affected depending on the time required to obtain sufficient quantities from the source, or to identify and obtain sufficient quantities from an alternative source.The Company depends on component and product manufacturing and logistical services provided by outsourcing partners, many of which are located outside of the U.S.Substantially all of the Company’s manufacturing is performed in whole or in part by outsourcing partners located primarily in Asia. A significant concentration of this manufacturing is currently performed by a small number of outsourcing partners, often in single locations. The Company has also outsourced much of its transportation and logistics management. While these arrangements can lower operating costs, they also reduce the Company’s direct control over production and distribution. Such diminished control may have an adverse effect on the quality or quantity of products or services, or the Company’s flexibility to respond to changing conditions. Although arrangements with these partners may contain provisions for product defect expense reimbursement, the Company generally remains responsible to the consumer for warranty and out-of-warranty service in the event of product defects and could experience an unanticipated product defect liability. While the Company relies on its partners to adhere to its supplier code of conduct, material violations of the supplier code of conduct could occur.The Company relies on single-source outsourcing partners in the U.S., Asia and Europe to supply and manufacture many components, and on outsourcing partners primarily located in Asia, for final assembly of substantially all of the Company’s hardware products. Any failure of these partners to perform can have a negative impact on the Company’s cost or supply of components or finished goods. In addition, manufacturing or logistics in these locations or transit to final destinations can be disrupted for a variety of reasons including, but not limited to, natural and man-made disasters, information technology system failures, commercial disputes, military actions, economic, business, labor, environmental, public health or political issues, or international trade disputes.Apple Inc. | 2019 Form 10-K | 7



The Company has invested in manufacturing process equipment, much of which is held at certain of its outsourcing partners, and has made prepayments to certain of its suppliers associated with long-term supply agreements. While these arrangements help ensure the supply of components and finished goods, if these outsourcing partners or suppliers experience severe financial problems or other disruptions in their business, such continued supply can be reduced or terminated and the recoverability of manufacturing process equipment or prepayments can be negatively impacted.The Company’s products and services may be affected from time to time by design and manufacturing defects that could materially adversely affect the Company’s business and result in harm to the Company’s reputation.The Company offers complex hardware and software products and services that can be affected by design and manufacturing defects. Sophisticated operating system software and applications, such as those offered by the Company, often have issues that can unexpectedly interfere with the intended operation of hardware or software products. Defects can also exist in components and products the Company purchases from third parties. Component defects could make the Company’s products unsafe and create a risk of environmental or property damage and personal injury. These risks may increase as the Company’s products are introduced into specialized applications, including healthcare. In addition, the Company’s service offerings may have quality issues and from time to time experience outages, service slowdowns or errors. As a result, the Company’s services may not perform as anticipated and may not meet customer expectations. There can be no assurance the Company will be able to detect and fix all issues and defects in the hardware, software and services it offers. Failure to do so could result in widespread technical and performance issues affecting the Company’s products and services. In addition, the Company can be exposed to product liability claims, recalls, product replacements or modifications, write-offs of inventory, property, plant and equipment, and/or intangible assets, and significant warranty and other expenses, including litigation costs and regulatory fines. Quality problems can also adversely affect the experience for users of the Company’s products and services, and result in harm to the Company’s reputation, loss of competitive advantage, poor market acceptance, reduced demand for products and services, delay in new product and service introductions and lost sales.The Company relies on access to third-party digital content, which may not be available to the Company on commercially reasonable terms or at all.The Company contracts with numerous third parties to offer their digital content to customers. This includes the right to sell currently available content. The licensing or other distribution arrangements with these third parties are for relatively short terms and do not guarantee the continuation or renewal of these arrangements on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. Some third-party content providers and distributors currently or in the future may offer competing products and services, and can take actions to make it more difficult or impossible for the Company to license or otherwise distribute their content in the future. Other content owners, providers or distributors may seek to limit the Company’s access to, or increase the cost of, such content. The Company may be unable to continue to offer a wide variety of content at commercially reasonable prices with acceptable usage rules, or continue to expand its geographic reach. Failure to obtain the right to make third-party digital content available, or to make such content available on commercially reasonable terms, could have a material adverse impact on the Company’s financial condition and operating results.Some third-party digital content providers require the Company to provide digital rights management and other security solutions. If requirements change, the Company may have to develop or license new technology to provide these solutions. There is no assurance the Company will be able to develop or license such solutions at a reasonable cost and in a timely manner. In addition, certain countries have passed or may propose and adopt legislation that would force the Company to license its digital rights management, which could lessen the protection of content and subject it to piracy and also could negatively affect arrangements with the Company’s content providers.The Company’s future performance depends in part on support from third-party software developers.The Company believes decisions by customers to purchase its hardware products depend in part on the availability of third-party software applications and services. There is no assurance that third-party developers will continue to develop and maintain software applications and services for the Company’s products. If third-party software applications and services cease to be developed and maintained for the Company’s products, customers may choose not to buy the Company’s products.The Company believes the availability of third-party software applications and services for its products depends in part on the developers’ perception and analysis of the relative benefits of developing, maintaining and upgrading such software and services for the Company’s products compared to competitors’ platforms, such as Android for smartphones and tablets and Windows for personal computers. This analysis may be based on factors such as the market position of the Company and its products, the anticipated revenue that may be generated, expected future growth of product sales, and the costs of developing such applications and services.Apple Inc. | 2019 Form 10-K | 8



The Company’s minority market share in the global smartphone, personal computer and tablet markets could make developers less inclined to develop or upgrade software for the Company’s products and more inclined to devote their resources to developing and upgrading software for competitors’ products with larger market share. If developers focus their efforts on these competing platforms, the availability and quality of applications for the Company’s devices may suffer.The Company relies on the continued availability and development of compelling and innovative software applications for its products. The Company’s products and operating systems are subject to rapid technological change, and if third-party developers are unable to or choose not to keep up with this pace of change, third-party applications might not take advantage of these changes to deliver improved customer experiences or might not operate correctly and may result in dissatisfied customers.The Company sells and delivers third-party applications for its products through the App Store, Mac App Store, TV App Store and Watch App Store. The Company retains a commission from sales through these platforms. If developers reduce their use of these platforms to distribute their applications and offer in-app purchases to customers, then the volume of sales, and the commission that the Company earns on those sales, would decrease.The Company relies on access to third-party intellectual property, which may not be available to the Company on commercially reasonable terms or at all.Many of the Company’s products and services are designed to include intellectual property owned by third parties, which requires licenses from those third parties. In addition, because of technological changes in the industries in which the Company currently competes or in the future may compete, current extensive patent coverage and the rapid rate of issuance of new patents, the Company’s products and services may unknowingly infringe existing patents or intellectual property rights of others. From time to time, the Company has been notified that it may be infringing certain patents or other intellectual property rights of third parties. Based on experience and industry practice, the Company believes licenses to such third-party intellectual property can generally be obtained on commercially reasonable terms. There is, however, no assurance that the necessary licenses can be obtained on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Failure to obtain the right to use third-party intellectual property, or to use such intellectual property on commercially reasonable terms, could preclude the Company from selling certain products or services, or otherwise have a material adverse impact on the Company’s financial condition and operating results.The Company could be impacted by unfavorable results of legal proceedings, such as being found to have infringed on intellectual property rights.The Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that have arisen in the ordinary course of business and have not yet been fully resolved, and new claims may arise in the future. In addition, agreements entered into by the Company sometimes include indemnification provisions which can subject the Company to costs and damages in the event of a claim against an indemnified third party.Claims against the Company based on allegations of patent infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights have generally increased over time and may continue to increase. In particular, the Company has historically faced a significant number of patent claims relating to its cellular-enabled products, and new claims may arise in the future. For example, technology and other patent-holding companies frequently assert their patents and seek royalties and often enter into litigation based on allegations of patent infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. The Company is vigorously defending infringement actions in courts in several U.S. jurisdictions, as well as internationally in various countries. The plaintiffs in these actions frequently seek injunctions and substantial damages.Regardless of the merit of particular claims, litigation can be expensive, time-consuming, disruptive to the Company’s operations and distracting to management. In recognition of these considerations, the Company may enter into licensing agreements or other arrangements to settle litigation and resolve such disputes. No assurance can be given that such agreements can be obtained on acceptable terms or that litigation will not occur. These agreements may also significantly increase the Company’s cost of sales and operating expenses.Except as described in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Note 10, “Commitments and Contingencies” under the heading “Contingencies,” in the opinion of management, there was not at least a reasonable possibility the Company may have incurred a material loss, or a material loss greater than a recorded accrual, concerning loss contingencies for asserted legal and other claims, including matters related to infringement of intellectual property rights.The outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain. If one or more legal matters were resolved against the Company or an indemnified third party in a reporting period for amounts above management’s expectations, the Company’s financial condition and operating results for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected. Further, such an outcome could result in significant compensatory, punitive or trebled monetary damages, disgorgement of revenue or profits, remedial corporate measures or injunctive relief against the Company that could materially adversely affect its financial condition and operating results.While the Company maintains insurance coverage for certain types of claims, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise.Apple Inc. | 2019 Form 10-K | 9



The Company is subject to complex and changing laws and regulations worldwide, which exposes the Company to potential liabilities, increased costs and other adverse effects on the Company’s business.The Company’s global operations are subject to complex and changing laws and regulations on subjects including, but not limited to: antitrust; privacy, data security and data localization; consumer protection; advertising, sales, billing and e-commerce; product liability; intellectual property ownership and infringement; digital platforms; Internet, telecommunications, and mobile communications; media, television, film and digital content; availability of third-party software applications and services; labor and employment; anti-corruption; import, export and trade; foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions; anti–money laundering; foreign ownership and investment; tax; and environmental, health and safety.Compliance with these laws and regulations may be onerous and expensive, increasing the cost of conducting the Company’s global operations. Changes to laws and regulations can adversely affect the Company’s business by increasing the Company’s costs, limiting the Company’s ability to offer a product or service to customers, requiring changes to the Company’s business practices or otherwise making the Company’s products and services less attractive to customers. The Company has implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations, but there can be no assurance that the Company’s employees, contractors or agents will not violate such laws and regulations or the Company’s policies and procedures. If the Company is found to have violated laws and regulations, it could materially adversely affect the Company’s reputation, financial condition and operating results.The technology industry, including, in some instances, the Company, is subject to intense media, political and regulatory scrutiny, which exposes the Company to government investigations, legal actions and penalties. For example, the Company is subject to antitrust investigations in various jurisdictions around the world, which can result in legal proceedings and claims against the Company that could, individually or in the aggregate, have a material impact on the Company’s financial condition and operating results. There can be no assurance that the Company’s business will not be materially adversely affected, individually or in the aggregate, by the outcomes of such investigations or changes to laws and regulations in the future.The Company’s retail stores have required and will continue to require a substantial investment and commitment of resources and are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties.The Company’s retail stores have required substantial investment in equipment and leasehold improvements, information systems, inventory and personnel. The Company also has entered into substantial lease commitments for retail space. Certain stores have been designed and built to serve as high-profile venues to promote brand awareness. Because of their unique design elements, locations and size, these stores require substantially more investment than the Company’s more typical retail stores. Due to the high cost structure associated with the Company’s retail stores, a decline in sales or the closure or poor performance of an individual store or multiple stores could result in significant lease termination costs, write-offs of equipment and leasehold improvements and severance costs.The Company’s retail operations are subject to many factors that pose risks and uncertainties and could adversely impact the Company’s financial condition and operating results, including macro-economic factors that could have an adverse effect on general retail activity. Other factors include, but are not limited to, the Company’s ability to: manage costs associated with retail store construction and operation; manage relationships with existing retail partners; manage costs associated with fluctuations in the value of retail inventory; and obtain and renew leases in quality retail locations at a reasonable cost.Investment in new business strategies and acquisitions could disrupt the Company’s ongoing business and present risks not originally contemplated.The Company has invested, and in the future may invest, in new business strategies or acquisitions. Such endeavors may involve significant risks and uncertainties, including distraction of management from current operations, greater-than-expected liabilities and expenses, inadequate return on capital, and unidentified issues not discovered in the Company’s due diligence. These new ventures are inherently risky and may not be successful.The Company’s business and reputation may be impacted by information technology system failures or network disruptions.The Company is exposed to information technology system failures or network disruptions caused by natural disasters, accidents, power disruptions, telecommunications failures, acts of terrorism or war, computer viruses, physical or electronic break-ins, or other events or disruptions. System redundancy and other continuity measures may be ineffective or inadequate, and the Company’s business continuity and disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities. Such failures or disruptions can adversely impact the Company’s business by, among other things, preventing access to the Company’s online services, interfering with customer transactions or impeding the manufacturing and shipping of the Company’s products. These events could materially adversely affect the Company’s reputation, financial condition and operating results.Apple Inc. | 2019 Form 10-K | 10



There may be losses or unauthorized access to or releases of confidential information, including personally identifiable information, that could subject the Company to significant reputational, financial, legal and operational consequences.The Company’s business requires it to use and store confidential information including, among other things, personally identifiable information (“PII”) with respect to the Company’s customers and employees. The Company devotes significant resources to network and data security, including through the use of encryption and other security measures intended to protect its systems and data. But these measures cannot provide absolute security, and losses or unauthorized access to or releases of confidential information occur and could materially adversely affect the Company’s reputation, financial condition and operating results.The Company’s business also requires it to share confidential information with suppliers and other third parties. Although the Company takes steps to secure confidential information that is provided to third parties, such measures are not always effective and losses or unauthorized access to or releases of confidential information occur and could materially adversely affect the Company’s reputation, financial condition and operating results.For example, the Company may experience a security breach impacting the Company’s information technology systems that compromises the confidentiality, integrity or availability of confidential information. Such an incident could, among other things, impair the Company’s ability to attract and retain customers for its products and services, impact the Company’s stock price, materially damage supplier relationships, and expose the Company to litigation or government investigations, which could result in penalties, fines or judgments against the Company.Although malicious attacks perpetrated to gain access to confidential information, including PII, affect many companies across various industries, the Company is at a relatively greater risk of being targeted because of its high profile and the value of the confidential information it creates, owns, manages, stores and processes.The Company has implemented systems and processes intended to secure its information technology systems and prevent unauthorized access to or loss of sensitive data, including through the use of encryption and authentication technologies. As with all companies, these security measures may not be sufficient for all eventualities and may be vulnerable to hacking, employee error, malfeasance, system error, faulty password management or other irregularities. For example, third parties fraudulently induce employees or customers into disclosing user names, passwords or other sensitive information, which may, in turn, be used to access the Company’s information technology systems. To help protect customers and the Company, the Company monitors its services and systems for unusual activity and may freeze accounts under suspicious circumstances, which, among other things, may result in the delay or loss of customer orders or impede customer access to the Company’s products and services.In addition to the risks relating to general confidential information described above, the Company is also subject to specific obligations relating to health data and payment card data. Health data is subject to additional privacy, security and breach notification requirements, and the Company can be subject to audit by governmental authorities regarding the Company’s compliance with these obligations. If the Company fails to adequately comply with these rules and requirements, or if health data is handled in a manner not permitted by law or under the Company’s agreements with healthcare institutions, the Company could be subject to litigation or government investigations, may be liable for associated investigatory expenses, and could also incur significant fees or fines.Under payment card rules and obligations, if cardholder information is potentially compromised, the Company could be liable for associated investigatory expenses and could also incur significant fees or fines if the Company fails to follow payment card industry data security standards. The Company could also experience a significant increase in payment card transaction costs or lose the ability to process payment cards if it fails to follow payment card industry data security standards, which would materially adversely affect the Company’s reputation, financial condition and operating results.While the Company maintains insurance coverage that is intended to address certain aspects of data security risks, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise.The Company’s business is subject to a variety of U.S. and international laws, rules, policies and other obligations regarding data protection.The Company is subject to federal, state and international laws relating to the collection, use, retention, security and transfer of PII. In many cases, these laws apply not only to third-party transactions, but also may restrict transfers of PII among the Company and its international subsidiaries. Several jurisdictions have passed laws in this area, and other jurisdictions are considering imposing additional restrictions. These laws continue to develop and may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Complying with emerging and changing international requirements may cause the Company to incur substantial costs or require the Company to change its business practices. Noncompliance could result in significant penalties or legal liability.The Company makes statements about its use and disclosure of PII through its privacy policy, information provided on its website and press statements. Any failure by the Company to comply with these public statements or with other federal, state or international privacy-related or data protection laws and regulations could result in proceedings against the Company by governmental entities or others. In addition to reputational impacts, penalties could include ongoing audit requirements and significant legal liability.Apple Inc. | 2019 Form 10-K | 11



The Company’s success depends largely on the continued service and availability of key personnel.Much of the Company’s future success depends on the continued availability and service of key personnel, including its Chief Executive Officer, executive team and other highly skilled employees. Experienced personnel in the technology industry are in high demand and competition for their talents is intense, especially in Silicon Valley, where most of the Company’s key personnel are located.The Company’s business can be impacted by political events, international trade disputes, war, terrorism, natural disasters, public health issues, industrial accidents and other business interruptions.Political events, international trade disputes, war, terrorism, natural disasters, public health issues, industrial accidents and other business interruptions could harm or disrupt international commerce and the global economy, and could have a material adverse effect on the Company and its customers, suppliers, contract manufacturers, logistics providers, distributors, cellular network carriers and other channel partners.International trade disputes can result in tariffs and other measures that can adversely affect the Company’s business. For example, trade tensions have led to a series of tariffs imposed by the U.S. on imports from China. Tariffs increase the cost of the Company’s products and the components and raw materials that go into making them. These increased costs adversely impact the gross margin that the Company earns on its products. Tariffs can also make the Company’s products more expensive for customers, which could make the Company’s products less competitive and reduce consumer demand. Countries may also adopt other measures that could limit the Company’s ability to offer its products and services. Political uncertainty surrounding international trade disputes and measures could also have a negative effect on consumer confidence and spending, which could adversely affect the Company’s business.Many of the Company’s operations and facilities, as well as critical business operations of the Company’s suppliers and contract manufacturers, are in locations that are prone to earthquakes and other natural disasters. In addition, such operations and facilities are subject to the risk of interruption by fire, power shortages, nuclear power plant accidents and other industrial accidents, terrorist attacks and other hostile acts, labor disputes, public health issues and other events beyond the Company’s control. Global climate change could result in certain types of natural disasters occurring more frequently or with more intense effects. Such events could make it difficult or impossible for the Company to manufacture and deliver products to its customers, create delays and inefficiencies in the Company’s supply and manufacturing chain, and result in slowdowns and outages to the Company’s service offerings. Following an interruption to its business, the Company could require substantial recovery time, experience significant expenditures to resume operations, and lose significant sales. Because the Company relies on single or limited sources for the supply and manufacture of many critical components, a business interruption affecting such sources would exacerbate any negative consequences to the Company.The Company’s operations are also subject to the risks of industrial accidents at its suppliers and contract manufacturers. While the Company’s suppliers are required to maintain safe working environments and operations, an industrial accident could occur and could result in disruption to the Company’s business and harm to the Company’s reputation. Should major public health issues, including pandemics, arise, the Company could be adversely affected by more stringent employee travel restrictions, additional limitations in freight services, governmental actions limiting the movement of products between regions, delays in production ramps of new products, and disruptions in the operations of the Company’s suppliers and contract manufacturers.While the Company maintains insurance coverage for certain types of losses, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses that may arise.The Company expects its quarterly net sales and operating results to fluctuate.The Company’s profit margins vary across its products, services, geographic segments and distribution channels. For example, gross margins on the Company’s hardware products vary across product lines and can change over time. The Company’s gross margins are subject to volatility and downward pressure due to a variety of factors, including: continued industry-wide global product pricing pressures and product pricing actions that the Company may take in response to such pressures; increased competition; the Company’s ability to effectively stimulate demand for certain of its products and services; compressed product life cycles; potential increases in the cost of components, outside manufacturing services, and acquiring and delivering content for the Company’s services; the Company’s ability to manage product quality and warranty costs effectively; shifts in the mix of products and services, or in the geographic, currency or channel mix; fluctuations in foreign exchange rates; and the introduction of new products or services, including new products or services with higher cost structures. These and other factors could have a materially adverse impact on the Company’s financial condition and operating results.Apple Inc. | 2019 Form 10-K | 12



The Company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its fiscal year due in part to seasonal holiday demand. Additionally, new product and service introductions can significantly impact net sales, cost of sales and operating expenses. Further, the Company generates a significant portion of its net sales from a single product and a decline in demand for that product could significantly impact quarterly net sales. The Company could also be subject to unexpected developments, such as lower-than-anticipated demand for the Company’s products or services, issues with new product or service introductions, information technology system failures or network disruptions, or failure of one of the Company’s logistics, components supply, or manufacturing partners.The Company’s stock price is subject to volatility.The Company’s stock price has experienced substantial price volatility in the past and may continue to do so in the future. Additionally, the Company, the technology industry and the stock market as a whole have experienced extreme stock price and volume fluctuations that have affected stock prices in ways that may have been unrelated to these companies’ operating performance. Price volatility over a given period may cause the average price at which the Company repurchases its stock to exceed the stock’s price at a given point in time. The Company believes its stock price should reflect expectations of future growth and profitability. The Company also believes its stock price should reflect expectations that its cash dividend will continue at current levels or grow, and that its current share repurchase program will be fully consummated. Future dividends are subject to declaration by the Company’s Board of Directors, and the Company’s share repurchase program does not obligate it to acquire any specific number of shares. If the Company fails to meet expectations related to future growth, profitability, dividends, share repurchases or other market expectations, its stock price may decline significantly, which could have a material adverse impact on investor confidence and employee retention.The Company’s financial performance is subject to risks associated with changes in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to local currencies.The Company’s primary exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates relates to non–U.S. dollar–denominated sales, cost of sales and operating expenses worldwide. Gross margins on the Company’s products in foreign countries and on products that include components obtained from foreign suppliers could be materially adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.The weakening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar adversely affects the U.S. dollar value of the Company’s foreign currency–denominated sales and earnings, and generally leads the Company to raise international pricing, potentially reducing demand for the Company’s products. In some circumstances, for competitive or other reasons, the Company may decide not to raise international pricing to offset the U.S. dollar’s strengthening, which would adversely affect the U.S. dollar value of the gross margins the Company earns on foreign currency–denominated sales.Conversely, a strengthening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, while generally beneficial to the Company’s foreign currency–denominated sales and earnings, could cause the Company to reduce international pricing and incur losses on its foreign currency derivative instruments, thereby limiting the benefit. Additionally, strengthening of foreign currencies may increase the Company’s cost of product components denominated in those currencies, thus adversely affecting gross margins.The Company uses derivative instruments, such as foreign currency forward and option contracts, to hedge certain exposures to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. The use of such hedging activities may not be effective to offset any, or more than a portion, of the adverse financial effects of unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates over the limited time the hedges are in place.The Company is exposed to credit risk and fluctuations in the values of its investment portfolio.The Company’s investments can be negatively affected by liquidity, credit deterioration, financial results, market and economic conditions, political risk, sovereign risk, interest rate fluctuations or other factors. As a result, the value and liquidity of the Company’s cash, cash equivalents, and marketable and non-marketable securities may fluctuate substantially. Therefore, although the Company has not realized any significant losses on its cash, cash equivalents, and marketable and non-marketable securities, future fluctuations in their value could result in significant losses and could have a material adverse impact on the Company’s financial condition and operating results.Apple Inc. | 2019 Form 10-K | 13

Products and Services PerformanceBeginning in the first quarter of 2019, the Company classified the amortization of the deferred value of Maps, Siri and free iCloud services, which are bundled in the sales price of iPhone, Mac, iPad and certain other products, in Services net sales. Historically, the Company classified the amortization of these amounts in Products net sales consistent with its management reporting framework. As a result, Products and Services net sales for 2018 and 2017 were reclassified to conform to the 2019 presentation.The following table shows net sales by category for 2019, 2018 and 2017 (dollars in millions):iPhoneiPhone net sales decreased during 2019 compared to 2018 due primarily to lower iPhone unit sales.MacMac net sales increased during 2019 compared to 2018 due primarily to higher net sales of MacBook Air, partially offset by lower net sales of MacBook® and MacBook Pro®.iPadiPad net sales increased during 2019 compared to 2018 due primarily to higher net sales of iPad Pro.Wearables, Home and AccessoriesWearables, Home and Accessories net sales increased during 2019 compared to 2018 due primarily to higher net sales of AirPods and Apple Watch.ServicesServices net sales increased during 2019 compared to 2018 due primarily to higher net sales from the App Store, licensing and AppleCare.Apple Inc. | 2019 Form 10-K | 19

Segment Operating PerformanceThe Company manages its business primarily on a geographic basis. The Company’s reportable segments consist of the Americas, Europe, Greater China, Japan and Rest of Asia Pacific. Americas includes both North and South America. Europe includes European countries, as well as India, the Middle East and Africa. Greater China includes China, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Rest of Asia Pacific includes Australia and those Asian countries not included in the Company’s other reportable segments. Although the reportable segments provide similar hardware and software products and similar services, each one is managed separately to better align with the location of the Company’s customers and distribution partners and the unique market dynamics of each geographic region. Further information regarding the Company’s reportable segments can be found in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Note 11, “Segment Information and Geographic Data.”The following table shows net sales by reportable segment for 2019, 2018 and 2017 (dollars in millions):AmericasAmericas net sales increased during 2019 compared to 2018 due primarily to higher Services and Wearables, Home and Accessories net sales, partially offset by lower iPhone net sales. The weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar had an unfavorable impact on Americas net sales during 2019.EuropeEurope net sales decreased during 2019 compared to 2018 due to lower iPhone net sales, partially offset by higher Wearables, Home and Accessories and Services net sales.

Gross MarginProducts and Services gross margin and gross margin percentage for 2019, 2018 and 2017 were as follows (dollars in millions):Products Gross MarginProducts gross margin and Products gross margin percentage decreased during 2019 compared to 2018 due primarily to lower iPhone unit sales and the weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar.Products gross margin increased during 2018 compared to 2017 due primarily to a favorable shift in mix of iPhones and the strength in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, partially offset by higher product cost structures. Year-over-year Products gross margin percentage decreased during 2018 due primarily to higher product cost structures, partially offset by the strength in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar.Services Gross MarginYear-over-year Services gross margin increased during 2019 and 2018 due primarily to higher Services net sales and a different services mix. Year-over-year Services gross margin percentage increased during 2019 and 2018 due primarily to a different services mix and leverage of the Company’s services fixed cost structure from higher Services net sales.The Company’s future gross margins can be impacted by a variety of factors, as set forth in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K under the heading “Risk Factors”. As a result, the Company believes, in general, gross margins will be subject to volatility and remain under downward pressure.Operating ExpensesOperating expenses for 2019, 2018 and 2017 were as follows (dollars in millions):Research and DevelopmentThe year-over-year growth in R&D expense in 2019 was driven primarily by increases in headcount-related expenses. The Company continues to believe that focused investments in R&D are critical to its future growth and competitive position in the marketplace, and to the development of new and updated products and services that are central to the Company’s core business strategy.Selling, General and AdministrativeThe year-over-year growth in selling, general and administrative expense in 2019 was driven primarily by increases in headcount-related expenses and higher spending on marketing and advertising and infrastructure-related costs.Apple Inc. | 2019 Form 10-K | 21

Other Income/(Expense), NetOther income/(expense), net (“OI&E”) for 2019, 2018 and 2017 was as follows (dollars in millions):The year-over-year decrease in OI&E during 2019 was due primarily to lower interest income and higher interest expense, partially offset by the impact of foreign exchange–related items. The weighted-average interest rate earned by the Company on its cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities was 2.19% and 2.16% in 2019 and 2018, respectively.Provision for Income TaxesProvision for income taxes, effective tax rate and statutory federal income tax rate for 2019, 2018 and 2017 were as follows (dollars in millions):On December 22, 2017, the U.S. enacted the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Act”), which significantly changed U.S. tax law. The Act lowered the Company’s U.S. statutory federal income tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018, while also imposing a deemed repatriation tax on previously deferred foreign income. By operation of law, the Company applied a blended U.S. statutory federal income tax rate of 24.5% for 2018 (the “2018 blended U.S. tax rate”). The Act also created a new minimum tax on certain foreign earnings.The Company’s effective tax rate for 2019 was lower than the statutory federal income tax rate due primarily to the lower tax rate on foreign earnings and tax benefits from share-based compensation. The Company’s effective tax rate for 2018 was lower than the 2018 blended U.S. tax rate due primarily to the lower tax rate on foreign earnings, partially offset by the remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities as a result of the Act.The Company’s effective tax rate for 2019 was lower compared to 2018 due primarily to a lower statutory federal income tax rate in 2019 and the impact of the Act in 2018, partially offset by higher taxes on foreign earnings in 2019.As of September 28, 2019, the Company had net deferred tax assets arising from deductible temporary differences and tax credits of $14.3 billion and deferred tax liabilities of $6.2 billion. Management believes it is more likely than not that forecasted income, including income that may be generated as a result of certain tax planning strategies, together with future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, will be sufficient to recover the net deferred tax assets. The Company will continue to evaluate the amount of the valuation allowance, if any, by assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets.Recent Accounting PronouncementsHedgingIn August 2017, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the “FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2017-12, Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities (“ASU 2017-12”). ASU 2017-12 expands component and fair value hedging, specifies the presentation of the effects of hedging instruments, and eliminates the separate measurement and presentation of hedge ineffectiveness. The Company will adopt ASU 2017-12 in its first quarter of 2020 utilizing the modified retrospective transition method. Based on the Company’s derivative portfolio and hedging strategies, the adoption of ASU 2017-12 is not expected to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.Financial InstrumentsIn June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments – Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments (“ASU 2016-13”), which modifies the measurement of expected credit losses on certain financial instruments. The Company will adopt ASU 2016-13 in its first quarter of 2021 utilizing the modified retrospective transition method. Based on the composition of the Company’s investment portfolio, current market conditions, and historical credit loss activity, the adoption of ASU 2016-13 is not expected to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.Apple Inc. | 2019 Form 10-K | 22

LeasesIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) (“ASU 2016-02”), which modifies lease accounting for lessees to increase transparency and comparability by recording lease assets and liabilities for operating leases and disclosing key information about leasing arrangements. The Company will adopt ASU 2016-02 utilizing the modified retrospective transition method through a cumulative-effect adjustment at the beginning of its first quarter of 2020. Upon adoption, the Company anticipates recording lease-related assets and liabilities of approximately $8 billion on its Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet, with no material impact to its Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations.Liquidity and Capital ResourcesThe following table presents selected financial information and statistics as of and for the years ended September 28, 2019, September 29, 2018 and September 30, 2017 (in millions):The Company believes its existing balances of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, along with commercial paper and other short-term liquidity arrangements, will be sufficient to satisfy its working capital needs, capital asset purchases, dividends, share repurchases, debt repayments and other liquidity requirements associated with its existing operations over the next 12 months.In connection with the State Aid Decision, as of September 28, 2019, the entire adjusted recovery amount of €12.9 billion plus interest of €1.2 billion was funded into escrow, where it will remain restricted from general use pending the conclusion of all appeals. Further information regarding the State Aid Decision can be found in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Note 5, “Income Taxes.”The Company’s marketable securities investment portfolio is primarily invested in highly rated securities, with the primary objective of minimizing the potential risk of principal loss. The Company’s investment policy generally requires securities to be investment grade and limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer.During 2019, cash generated by operating activities of $69.4 billion was a result of $55.3 billion of net income and non-cash adjustments to net income of $17.6 billion, partially offset by a decrease in the net change in operating assets and liabilities of $3.5 billion. Cash generated by investing activities of $45.9 billion during 2019 consisted primarily of proceeds from sales and maturities of marketable securities, net of purchases, of $57.5 billion, partially offset by cash used to acquire property, plant and equipment of $10.5 billion. Cash used in financing activities of $91.0 billion during 2019 consisted primarily of cash used to repurchase common stock of $66.9 billion, cash used to pay dividends and dividend equivalents of $14.1 billion, cash used to repay term debt of $8.8 billion and net repayments of commercial paper of $6.0 billion, partially offset by net proceeds from the issuance of term debt of $7.0 billion.During 2018, cash generated by operating activities of $77.4 billion was a result of $59.5 billion of net income and an increase in the net change in operating assets and liabilities of $34.7 billion, partially offset by non-cash adjustments to net income of $16.8 billion. Cash generated by investing activities of $16.1 billion during 2018 consisted primarily of proceeds from maturities and sales of marketable securities, net of purchases, of $32.4 billion, partially offset by cash used to acquire property, plant and equipment of $13.3 billion. Cash used in financing activities of $87.9 billion during 2018 consisted primarily of cash used to repurchase common stock of $72.7 billion, cash used to pay dividends and dividend equivalents of $13.7 billion and cash used to repay term debt of $6.5 billion, partially offset by net proceeds from the issuance of term debt of $7.0 billion.Apple Inc. | 2019 Form 10-K | 23

Capital AssetsThe Company’s capital expenditures were $7.6 billion during 2019, which included product tooling and manufacturing process equipment; data centers; corporate facilities and infrastructure, including information systems hardware, software and enhancements; and retail store facilities.DebtThe Company issues unsecured short-term promissory notes (“Commercial Paper”) pursuant to a commercial paper program. The Company uses the net proceeds from the commercial paper program for general corporate purposes, including dividends and share repurchases. As of September 28, 2019, the Company had $6.0 billion of Commercial Paper outstanding, with a weighted-average interest rate of 2.24% and maturities generally less than nine months.As of September 28, 2019, the Company had outstanding floating- and fixed-rate notes with varying maturities for an aggregate principal amount of $101.7 billion (collectively the “Notes”). During 2019, the Company issued $7.0 billion and repaid $8.8 billion of Notes. The Company has entered, and in the future may enter, into interest rate swaps to manage interest rate risk on the Notes. In addition, the Company has entered, and in the future may enter, into foreign currency swaps to manage foreign currency risk on the Notes.Further information regarding the Company’s debt issuances and related hedging activity can be found in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Note 3, “Financial Instruments” and Note 6, “Debt.”Capital Return ProgramOn April 30, 2019, the Company announced the Board of Directors increased the current share repurchase program authorization from $100 billion to $175 billion of the Company’s common stock, of which $96.1 billion had been utilized as of September 28, 2019. During 2019, the Company repurchased 345.2 million shares of its common stock for $67.1 billion, including 62.0 million shares delivered under a $12.0 billion ASR dated February 2019, which settled in August 2019. The Company’s share repurchase program does not obligate it to acquire any specific number of shares. Under this program, shares may be repurchased in privately negotiated and/or open market transactions, including under plans complying with Rule 10b5-1 under the Exchange Act.On April 30, 2019, the Company also announced the Board of Directors raised the Company’s quarterly cash dividend from $0.73 to $0.77 per share, beginning with the dividend paid during the third quarter of 2019. The Company intends to increase its dividend on an annual basis, subject to declaration by the Board of Directors.Contractual ObligationsThe following table presents certain payments due by the Company as of September 28, 2019, and excludes amounts already recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, except for term debt and the deemed repatriation tax payable (in millions):Operating LeasesThe Company’s retail store and other facility leases typically have original terms not exceeding 10 years and generally contain multi-year renewal options.Manufacturing Purchase ObligationsThe Company utilizes several outsourcing partners to manufacture sub-assemblies for the Company’s products and to perform final assembly and testing of finished products. These outsourcing partners acquire components and build product based on demand information supplied by the Company, which typically covers periods up to 150 days. The Company also obtains individual components for its products from a wide variety of individual suppliers.Apple Inc. | 2019 Form 10-K | 24



Other Purchase ObligationsThe Company’s other purchase obligations consist of noncancelable obligations to acquire capital assets, including product tooling and manufacturing process equipment, and noncancelable obligations related to advertising, licensing, R&D, Internet and telecommunications services, content creation and other activities.Deemed Repatriation Tax PayableAs of September 28, 2019, a significant portion of the other non-current liabilities in the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheet consisted of the deemed repatriation tax payable imposed by the Act. The Company plans to pay the deemed repatriation tax payable in installments in accordance with the Act.Other Non-Current LiabilitiesThe Company’s remaining other non-current liabilities primarily consist of items for which the Company is unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing or amount of payments; therefore, such amounts are not included in the above contractual obligation table.Critical Accounting Policies and EstimatesThe preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) and the Company’s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and operating results require the Company’s management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported. Note 1, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Company’s consolidated financial statements. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. Actual results may differ from these estimates, and such differences may be material.Management believes the Company’s critical accounting policies and estimates are those related to revenue recognition, valuation of manufacturing-related assets and estimation of inventory purchase commitment cancellation fees, warranty costs, income taxes, and legal and other contingencies. Management considers these policies critical because they are both important to the portrayal of the Company’s financial condition and operating results, and they require management to make judgments and estimates about inherently uncertain matters. The Company’s senior management has reviewed these critical accounting policies and related disclosures with the Audit and Finance Committee of the Company’s Board of Directors.Revenue RecognitionThe Company has identified up to three performance obligations regularly included in arrangements involving the sale of iPhone, Mac, iPad and certain other products. The first performance obligation, which represents the substantial portion of the allocated sales price, is the hardware and bundled software delivered at the time of sale. The second performance obligation is the right to receive certain product-related bundled services, which include iCloud, Siri and Maps. The third performance obligation is the right to receive, on a when-and-if-available basis, future unspecified software upgrades relating to the software bundled with each device. The Company allocates revenue and any related discounts to these performance obligations based on their relative stand-alone selling prices (“SSPs”). Because the Company lacks observable prices for the undelivered performance obligations, the allocation of revenue is based on the Company’s estimated SSPs. Revenue allocated to the product-related bundled services and unspecified software upgrade rights is deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis over the estimated period they are expected to be provided. The Company’s process for determining estimated SSPs involves management’s judgment and considers multiple factors that may vary over time depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each deliverable. Should future facts and circumstances change, the Company’s SSPs and the future rate of related amortization for product-related bundled services and unspecified software upgrade rights related to future sales of these devices could change. Factors subject to change include the nature of the product-related bundled services and unspecified software upgrade rights offered, their estimated value and the estimated period they are expected to be provided.Apple Inc. | 2019 Form 10-K | 25


## Item 7A


The Company’s investment policy and strategy are focused on the preservation of capital and supporting the Company’s liquidity requirements. The Company uses a combination of internal and external management to execute its investment strategy and achieve its investment objectives. The Company typically invests in highly rated securities, with the primary objective of minimizing the potential risk of principal loss. The Company’s investment policy generally requires securities to be investment grade and limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. To provide a meaningful assessment of the interest rate risk associated with the Company’s investment portfolio, the Company performed a sensitivity analysis to determine the impact a change in interest rates would have on the value of the investment portfolio assuming a 100 basis point parallel shift in the yield curve. Based on investment positions as of September 28, 2019 and September 29, 2018, a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates across all maturities would result in a $2.8 billion and $4.9 billion incremental decline in the fair market value of the portfolio, respectively. Such losses would only be realized if the Company sold the investments prior to maturity.As of September 28, 2019 and September 29, 2018, the Company had outstanding floating- and fixed-rate notes with varying maturities for an aggregate carrying amount of $102.1 billion and $102.5 billion, respectively. The Company has entered, and in the future may enter, into interest rate swaps to manage interest rate risk on its outstanding term debt. Interest rate swaps allow the Company to effectively convert fixed-rate payments into floating-rate payments or floating-rate payments into fixed-rate payments. Gains and losses on term debt are generally offset by the corresponding losses and gains on the related hedging instrument. A 100 basis point increase in market interest rates would cause interest expense on the Company’s debt as of September 28, 2019 and September 29, 2018 to increase by $325 million and $399 million on an annualized basis, respectively.Foreign Currency RiskIn general, the Company is a net receiver of currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Accordingly, changes in exchange rates, and in particular a strengthening of the U.S. dollar, will negatively affect the Company’s net sales and gross margins as expressed in U.S. dollars. There is a risk that the Company will have to adjust local currency pricing due to competitive pressures when there has been significant volatility in foreign currency exchange rates.The Company may enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts with financial institutions to protect against foreign exchange risks associated with certain existing assets and liabilities, certain firmly committed transactions, forecasted future cash flows and net investments in foreign subsidiaries. In addition, the Company has entered, and in the future may enter, into foreign currency contracts to partially offset the foreign currency exchange gains and losses on its foreign currency–denominated debt issuances. The Company generally hedges portions of its forecasted foreign currency exposure associated with revenue and inventory purchases, typically for up to 12 months. However, the Company may choose not to hedge certain foreign exchange exposures for a variety of reasons including, but not limited to, accounting considerations or the prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures.To provide an assessment of the foreign currency risk associated with certain of the Company’s foreign currency derivative positions, the Company performed a sensitivity analysis using a value-at-risk (“VAR”) model to assess the potential impact of fluctuations in exchange rates. The VAR model consisted of using a Monte Carlo simulation to generate thousands of random market price paths assuming normal market conditions. The VAR is the maximum expected loss in fair value, for a given confidence interval, to the Company’s foreign currency derivative positions due to adverse movements in rates. The VAR model is not intended to represent actual losses but is used as a risk estimation and management tool. Forecasted transactions, firm commitments and assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies were excluded from the model. Based on the results of the model, the Company estimates with 95% confidence, a maximum one-day loss in fair value of $452 million as of September 28, 2019, compared to a maximum one-day loss in fair value of $592 million as of September 29, 2018. Because the Company uses foreign currency instruments for hedging purposes, the losses in fair value incurred on those instruments are generally offset by increases in the fair value of the underlying exposures.Actual future gains and losses associated with the Company’s investment portfolio, debt and derivative positions may differ materially from the sensitivity analyses performed as of September 28, 2019 due to the inherent limitations associated with predicting the timing and amount of changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and the Company’s actual exposures and positions.Apple Inc. | 2019 Form 10-K | 27

Apple Inc.CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS(In millions)See accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.Apple Inc. | 2019 Form 10-K | 33



Apple Inc.Notes to Consolidated Financial StatementsNote 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting PoliciesBasis of Presentation and PreparationThe accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Apple Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries (collectively “Apple” or the “Company”). Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. In the opinion of the Company’s management, the consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments, which are normal and recurring in nature, necessary for fair financial statement presentation. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates. Certain prior period amounts in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been reclassified to conform to the current period’s presentation.The Company’s fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week period that ends on the last Saturday of September. The Company’s fiscal years 2019 and 2018 spanned 52 weeks each, whereas fiscal year 2017 included 53 weeks. A 14th week was included in the first fiscal quarter of 2017, as is done every five or six years, to realign the Company’s fiscal quarters with calendar quarters. Unless otherwise stated, references to particular years, quarters, months and periods refer to the Company’s fiscal years ended in September and the associated quarters, months and periods of those fiscal years.Recently Adopted Accounting PronouncementsRevenue RecognitionIn the first quarter of 2019, the Company adopted the Financial Accounting Standards Board’s (the “FASB”) Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) (“ASU 2014-09”), and additional ASUs issued to clarify the guidance in ASU 2014-09 (collectively the “new revenue standard”), which amends the existing accounting standards for revenue recognition. The Company adopted the new revenue standard utilizing the full retrospective transition method. The Company did not restate total net sales in the prior periods presented, as the adoption of the new revenue standard did not have a material impact on previously reported amounts.Additionally, beginning in the first quarter of 2019, the Company classified the amortization of the deferred value of Maps, Siri and free iCloud services, which are bundled in the sales price of iPhone, Mac, iPad and certain other products, in Services net sales. Historically, the Company classified the amortization of these amounts in Products net sales consistent with its management reporting framework. As a result, Products and Services net sales for 2018 and 2017 were reclassified to conform to the 2019 presentation.Financial InstrumentsIn the first quarter of 2019, the Company adopted FASB ASU No. 2016-01, Financial Instruments – Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities (“ASU 2016-01”), which updates certain aspects of the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of financial instruments. The adoption of ASU 2016-01 did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.Income TaxesIn the first quarter of 2019, the Company adopted FASB ASU No. 2016-16, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory (“ASU 2016-16”), which requires the recognition of the income tax consequences of an intra-entity transfer of an asset, other than inventory, when the transfer occurs. The Company adopted ASU 2016-16 utilizing the modified retrospective transition method. Upon adoption, the Company recorded $2.7 billion of net deferred tax assets, reduced other non-current assets by $128 million, and increased retained earnings by $2.6 billion on its Consolidated Balance Sheet. The Company will recognize incremental deferred income tax expense as these net deferred tax assets are utilized.Restricted CashIn the first quarter of 2019, the Company adopted FASB ASU No. 2016-18, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Restricted Cash (“ASU 2016-18”), which enhances and clarifies the guidance on the classification and presentation of restricted cash in the statement of cash flows and requires additional disclosures about restricted cash balances.Advertising CostsAdvertising costs are expensed as incurred and included in selling, general and administrative expenses.Apple Inc. | 2019 Form 10-K | 34

Share-Based CompensationThe Company generally measures share-based compensation based on the closing price of the Company’s common stock on the date of grant, and recognizes expense on a straight-line basis for its estimate of equity awards that will ultimately vest. Further information regarding share-based compensation can be found in Note 9, “Benefit Plans.”Earnings Per ShareThe following table shows the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share for 2019, 2018 and 2017 (net income in millions and shares in thousands):The Company applies the treasury stock method to determine the dilutive effect of potentially dilutive securities. Potentially dilutive securities representing 15.5 million shares of common stock were excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share for 2019 because their effect would have been antidilutive.Cash Equivalents and Marketable SecuritiesAll highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase are classified as cash equivalents.The Company’s investments in marketable debt securities have been classified and accounted for as available-for-sale. The Company classifies its marketable debt securities as either short-term or long-term based on each instrument’s underlying contractual maturity date. Unrealized gains and losses on marketable debt securities classified as available-for-sale are recognized in other comprehensive income/(loss) (“OCI”). The Company’s investments in marketable equity securities are classified based on the nature of the securities and their availability for use in current operations. The Company’s marketable equity securities are measured at fair value with gains and losses recognized in other income/(expense), net (“OI&E”).The cost of securities sold is determined using the specific identification method.InventoriesInventories are measured using the first-in, first-out method.Property, Plant and EquipmentDepreciation on property, plant and equipment is recognized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which for buildings is the lesser of 30 years or the remaining life of the underlying building; between one and five years for machinery and equipment, including product tooling and manufacturing process equipment; and the shorter of lease term or useful life for leasehold improvements. Capitalized costs related to internal-use software are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which range from three to five years. Depreciation and amortization expense on property and equipment was $11.3 billion, $9.3 billion and $8.2 billion during 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.Non-cash investing activities involving property, plant and equipment resulted in a net increase/(decrease) to accounts payable and other current liabilities of $(2.9) billion and $3.4 billion during 2019 and 2018, respectively.Apple Inc. | 2019 Form 10-K | 35



Non-Marketable SecuritiesThe Company has elected to apply the measurement alternative to equity securities without readily determinable fair values. As such, the Company’s non-marketable equity securities are measured at cost, less any impairment, and are adjusted for changes in fair value resulting from observable transactions for identical or similar investments of the same issuer. Gains and losses on non-marketable equity securities are recognized in OI&E.Restricted Cash and Restricted Marketable SecuritiesThe Company considers cash and marketable securities to be restricted when withdrawal or general use is legally restricted. The Company records restricted cash as other assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, and determines current or non-current classification based on the expected duration of the restriction. The Company records restricted marketable securities as current or non-current marketable securities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets based on the classification of the underlying securities.Fair Value MeasurementsThe fair values of the Company’s money market funds and certain marketable equity securities are based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets. The valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of the Company’s debt instruments and all other financial instruments, which generally have counterparties with high credit ratings, are based on quoted market prices or model-driven valuations using significant inputs derived from or corroborated by observable market data.Note 2 – Revenue RecognitionNet sales consist of revenue from the sale of iPhone, Mac, iPad, Services and other products. The Company recognizes revenue at the amount to which it expects to be entitled when control of the products or services is transferred to its customers. Control is generally transferred when the Company has a present right to payment and title and the significant risks and rewards of ownership of products or services are transferred to its customers. For most of the Company’s Products net sales, control transfers when products are shipped. For the Company’s Services net sales, control transfers over time as services are delivered. Payment for Products and Services net sales is collected within a short period following transfer of control or commencement of delivery of services, as applicable.The Company records reductions to Products net sales related to future product returns, price protection and other customer incentive programs based on the Company’s expectations and historical experience.For arrangements with multiple performance obligations, which represent promises within an arrangement that are capable of being distinct, the Company allocates revenue to all distinct performance obligations based on their relative stand-alone selling prices (“SSPs”). When available, the Company uses observable prices to determine SSPs. When observable prices are not available, SSPs are established that reflect the Company’s best estimates of what the selling prices of the performance obligations would be if they were sold regularly on a stand-alone basis. The Company’s process for estimating SSPs without observable prices considers multiple factors that may vary depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each performance obligation including, where applicable, prices charged by the Company for similar offerings, market trends in the pricing for similar offerings, product-specific business objectives and the estimated cost to provide the performance obligation.The Company has identified up to three performance obligations regularly included in arrangements involving the sale of iPhone, Mac, iPad and certain other products. The first performance obligation, which represents the substantial portion of the allocated sales price, is the hardware and bundled software delivered at the time of sale. The second performance obligation is the right to receive certain product-related bundled services, which include iCloud, Siri and Maps. The third performance obligation is the right to receive, on a when-and-if-available basis, future unspecified software upgrades relating to the software bundled with each device. The Company allocates revenue and any related discounts to these performance obligations based on their relative SSPs. Because the Company lacks observable prices for the undelivered performance obligations, the allocation of revenue is based on the Company’s estimated SSPs. Revenue allocated to the delivered hardware and bundled software is recognized when control has transferred to the customer, which generally occurs when the product is shipped. Revenue allocated to the product-related bundled services and unspecified software upgrade rights is deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis over the estimated period they are expected to be provided. Cost of sales related to delivered hardware and bundled software, including estimated warranty costs, are recognized at the time of sale. Costs incurred to provide product-related bundled services and unspecified software upgrade rights are recognized as cost of sales as incurred.For certain long-term service arrangements, the Company has performance obligations for services it has not yet delivered. For these arrangements, the Company does not have a right to bill for the undelivered services. The Company has determined that any unbilled consideration relates entirely to the value of the undelivered services. Accordingly, the Company has not recognized revenue, and has elected not to disclose amounts, related to these undelivered services.Apple Inc. | 2019 Form 10-K | 36

For the sale of third-party products where the Company obtains control of the product before transferring it to the customer, the Company recognizes revenue based on the gross amount billed to customers. The Company considers multiple factors when determining whether it obtains control of third-party products including, but not limited to, evaluating if it can establish the price of the product, retains inventory risk for tangible products or has the responsibility for ensuring acceptability of the product. For third-party applications sold through the App Store, Mac App Store, TV App Store and Watch App Store and certain digital content sold through the Company’s other digital content stores, the Company does not obtain control of the product before transferring it to the customer. Therefore, the Company accounts for such sales on a net basis by recognizing in Services net sales only the commission it retains.The Company has elected to record revenue net of taxes collected from customers that are remitted to governmental authorities, with the collected taxes recorded within other current liabilities until remitted to the relevant government authority.Deferred RevenueAs of September 28, 2019 and September 29, 2018, the Company had total deferred revenue of $8.1 billion and $8.8 billion, respectively. As of September 28, 2019, the Company expects 68% of total deferred revenue to be realized in less than a year, 25% within one-to-two years, 6% within two-to-three years and 1% in greater than three years.Disaggregated RevenueNet sales disaggregated by significant products and services for 2019, 2018 and 2017 were as follows (in millions):The Company’s proportion of net sales by disaggregated revenue source was generally consistent for each reportable segment in Note 11, “Segment Information and Geographic Data” for 2019, 2018 and 2017.Apple Inc. | 2019 Form 10-K | 37

The Company may sell certain of its marketable debt securities prior to their stated maturities for reasons including, but not limited to, managing liquidity, credit risk, duration and asset allocation. The maturities of the Company’s long-term marketable debt securities generally range from one to five years.The following tables show information about the Company’s marketable securities that had been in a continuous unrealized loss position for less than 12 months and for 12 months or greater as of September 28, 2019 and September 29, 2018 (in millions):The Company typically invests in highly rated securities, with the primary objective of minimizing the potential risk of principal loss. The Company’s investment policy generally requires securities to be investment grade and limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. Fair values were determined for each individual security in the investment portfolio. When evaluating a marketable debt security for other-than-temporary impairment, the Company reviews factors such as the duration and extent to which the fair value of the security is less than its cost, the financial condition of the issuer and any changes thereto, and the Company’s intent to sell, or whether it will more likely than not be required to sell, the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis. As of September 28, 2019, the Company does not consider any of its marketable debt securities to be other-than-temporarily impaired.Non-Marketable SecuritiesThe Company holds non-marketable equity securities of certain privately held companies without readily determinable fair values. As of September 28, 2019, the Company’s non-marketable equity securities had a carrying value of $2.9 billion.Restricted CashA reconciliation of the Company’s cash and cash equivalents in the Consolidated Balance Sheet to cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows as of September 28, 2019 is as follows (in millions):The Company’s restricted cash primarily consisted of cash required to be on deposit under a contractual agreement with a bank to support the Company’s iPhone Upgrade Program.Derivative Financial InstrumentsThe Company may use derivatives to partially offset its business exposure to foreign currency and interest rate risk on expected future cash flows, net investments in certain foreign subsidiaries, and certain existing assets and liabilities. However, the Company may choose not to hedge certain exposures for a variety of reasons including, but not limited to, accounting considerations or the prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures. There can be no assurance the hedges will offset more than a portion of the financial impact resulting from movements in foreign currency exchange or interest rates.To protect gross margins from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, certain of the Company’s subsidiaries whose functional currency is the U.S. dollar may hedge a portion of forecasted foreign currency revenue, and subsidiaries whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar may hedge a portion of forecasted inventory purchases not denominated in the subsidiaries’ functional currencies. The Company may enter into forward contracts, option contracts or other instruments to manage this risk and may designate these instruments as cash flow hedges. The Company generally hedges portions of its forecasted foreign currency exposure associated with revenue and inventory purchases, typically for up to 12 months.Apple Inc. | 2019 Form 10-K | 39



To protect the net investment in a foreign operation from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, the Company may enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts to offset a portion of the changes in the carrying amounts of these investments due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. In addition, the Company may use non-derivative financial instruments, such as its foreign currency–denominated debt, as hedges of its net investments in certain foreign subsidiaries. In both of these cases, the Company designates these instruments as net investment hedges.To protect the Company’s foreign currency–denominated term debt or marketable securities from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, the Company may enter into forward contracts, cross-currency swaps or other instruments. These instruments may offset a portion of the foreign currency remeasurement gains or losses, or changes in fair value. The Company may designate these instruments as either cash flow or fair value hedges. As of September 28, 2019, the Company’s hedged term debt– and marketable securities–related foreign currency transactions are expected to be recognized within 23 years.The Company may also enter into non-designated foreign currency contracts to offset a portion of the foreign currency exchange gains and losses generated by the remeasurement of certain assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies.To protect the Company’s foreign currency–denominated term debt or marketable securities from fluctuations in interest rates, the Company may enter into interest rate swaps, options or other instruments. These instruments may offset a portion of the changes in interest income or expense, or changes in fair value. The Company designates these instruments as either cash flow or fair value hedges. As of September 28, 2019, the Company’s hedged interest rate transactions are expected to be recognized within 8 years.Cash Flow HedgesThe effective portions of cash flow hedges are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss) (“AOCI”) until the hedged item is recognized in earnings. Deferred gains and losses associated with cash flow hedges of foreign currency revenue are recognized as a component of net sales in the same period as the related revenue is recognized, and deferred gains and losses related to cash flow hedges of inventory purchases are recognized as a component of cost of sales in the same period as the related costs are recognized. Deferred gains and losses associated with cash flow hedges of interest income or expense are recognized in OI&E in the same period as the related income or expense is recognized. For options designated as cash flow hedges, changes in the time value are excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness. The ineffective portions and amounts excluded from the effectiveness testing of cash flow hedges are recognized in OI&E.Derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges must be de-designated as hedges when it is probable the forecasted hedged transaction will not occur in the initially identified time period or within a subsequent two-month time period. Deferred gains and losses in AOCI associated with such derivative instruments are reclassified into OI&E in the period of de-designation. Any subsequent changes in fair value of such derivative instruments are reflected in OI&E unless they are re-designated as hedges of other transactions.Net Investment HedgesThe effective portions of net investment hedges are recorded in OCI as a part of the cumulative translation adjustment. The ineffective portions and amounts excluded from the effectiveness testing of net investment hedges are recognized in OI&E. For foreign exchange forward contracts designated as net investment hedges, the Company excludes changes in fair value relating to changes in the forward carry component from its assessment of hedge effectiveness. Accordingly, any gains or losses related to this forward carry component are recognized in earnings in the current period.Fair Value HedgesGains and losses related to changes in fair value hedges are recognized in earnings along with a corresponding loss or gain related to the change in value of the underlying hedged item in the same line in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. For foreign exchange forward contracts designated as fair value hedges, the Company excludes changes in fair value relating to changes in the forward carry component from its assessment of hedge effectiveness. The amount excluded from the effectiveness testing of fair value hedges was a gain of $777 million for 2019, and was recognized in OI&E.Non-Designated DerivativesDerivatives that are not designated as hedging instruments are adjusted to fair value through earnings in the financial statement line item to which the derivative relates.Apple Inc. | 2019 Form 10-K | 40

The following table shows the pre-tax gains and losses of the Company’s derivative and non-derivative instruments designated as cash flow, net investment and fair value hedges in OCI and the Consolidated Statements of Operations for 2019, 2018 and 2017 (in millions):The following table shows the notional amounts of the Company’s outstanding derivative instruments and credit risk amounts associated with outstanding or unsettled derivative instruments as of September 28, 2019 and September 29, 2018 (in millions):The notional amounts for outstanding derivative instruments provide one measure of the transaction volume outstanding and do not represent the amount of the Company’s exposure to credit or market loss. The credit risk amounts represent the Company’s gross exposure to potential accounting loss on derivative instruments that are outstanding or unsettled if all counterparties failed to perform according to the terms of the contract, based on then-current currency or interest rates at each respective date. The Company’s exposure to credit loss and market risk will vary over time as currency and interest rates change. Although the table above reflects the notional and credit risk amounts of the Company’s derivative instruments, it does not reflect the gains or losses associated with the exposures and transactions that the instruments are intended to hedge. The amounts ultimately realized upon settlement of these financial instruments, together with the gains and losses on the underlying exposures, will depend on actual market conditions during the remaining life of the instruments.Apple Inc. | 2019 Form 10-K | 42

The Company generally enters into master netting arrangements, which are designed to reduce credit risk by permitting net settlement of transactions with the same counterparty. To further limit credit risk, the Company generally enters into collateral security arrangements that provide for collateral to be received or posted when the net fair value of certain financial instruments fluctuates from contractually established thresholds. The Company presents its derivative assets and derivative liabilities at their gross fair values in its Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of September 28, 2019, the net cash collateral received by the Company related to derivative instruments under its collateral security arrangements was $1.6 billion, which was recorded as other current liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. As of September 29, 2018, the net cash collateral posted by the Company related to derivative instruments under its collateral security arrangements was $1.0 billion, which was recorded as other current assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.Under master netting arrangements with the respective counterparties to the Company’s derivative contracts, the Company is allowed to net settle transactions with a single net amount payable by one party to the other. As of September 28, 2019 and September 29, 2018, the potential effects of these rights of set-off associated with the Company’s derivative contracts, including the effects of collateral, would be a reduction to both derivative assets and derivative liabilities of $2.7 billion and $2.1 billion, respectively, resulting in a net derivative liability of $407 million and a net derivative asset of $138 million, respectively.Accounts ReceivableTrade ReceivablesThe Company has considerable trade receivables outstanding with its third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers, resellers, small and mid-sized businesses and education, enterprise and government customers. The Company generally does not require collateral from its customers; however, the Company will require collateral or third-party credit support in certain instances to limit credit risk. In addition, when possible, the Company attempts to limit credit risk on trade receivables with credit insurance for certain customers or by requiring third-party financing, loans or leases to support credit exposure. These credit-financing arrangements are directly between the third-party financing company and the end customer. As such, the Company generally does not assume any recourse or credit risk sharing related to any of these arrangements.As of September 28, 2019, the Company had no customers that individually represented 10% or more of total trade receivables. As of September 29, 2018, the Company had one customer that represented 10% or more of total trade receivables, which accounted for 10%. The Company’s cellular network carriers accounted for 51% and 59% of total trade receivables as of September 28, 2019 and September 29, 2018, respectively.Vendor Non-Trade ReceivablesThe Company has non-trade receivables from certain of its manufacturing vendors resulting from the sale of components to these vendors who manufacture sub-assemblies or assemble final products for the Company. The Company purchases these components directly from suppliers. As of September 28, 2019, the Company had two vendors that individually represented 10% or more of total vendor non-trade receivables, which accounted for 59% and 14%. As of September 29, 2018, the Company had two vendors that individually represented 10% or more of total vendor non-trade receivables, which accounted for 62% and 12%.Note 4 – Consolidated Financial Statement DetailsThe following tables show the Company’s consolidated financial statement details as of September 28, 2019 and September 29, 2018 (in millions):Property, Plant and Equipment, NetApple Inc. | 2019 Form 10-K | 43

Other Non-Current LiabilitiesOther Income/(Expense), NetThe following table shows the detail of OI&E for 2019, 2018 and 2017 (in millions):Note 5 – Income TaxesU.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs ActOn December 22, 2017, the U.S. enacted the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Act”), which significantly changed U.S. tax law. The Act lowered the Company’s U.S. statutory federal income tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018, while also imposing a deemed repatriation tax on previously deferred foreign income. The Act also created a new minimum tax on certain foreign earnings, for which the Company has elected to record certain deferred tax assets and liabilities. The Company completed its accounting for the income tax effects of the Act during 2019, in accordance with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118.Provision for Income Taxes and Effective Tax RateThe provision for income taxes for 2019, 2018 and 2017, consisted of the following (in millions):The foreign provision for income taxes is based on foreign pre-tax earnings of $44.3 billion, $48.0 billion and $44.7 billion in 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.Apple Inc. | 2019 Form 10-K | 44

A reconciliation of the provision for income taxes, with the amount computed by applying the statutory federal income tax rate (21% in 2019; 24.5% in 2018; 35% in 2017) to income before provision for income taxes for 2019, 2018 and 2017, is as follows (dollars in millions):The Company’s income taxes payable have been reduced by the tax benefits from employee stock plan awards. For restricted stock units (“RSUs”), the Company receives an income tax benefit upon the award’s vesting equal to the tax effect of the underlying stock’s fair market value. Prior to 2018, the Company reflected net excess tax benefits from equity awards as increases to additional paid-in capital, which amounted to $620 million in 2017.Deferred Tax Assets and LiabilitiesAs of September 28, 2019 and September 29, 2018, the significant components of the Company’s deferred tax assets and liabilities were (in millions):Deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect the effects of tax credits and the future income tax effects of temporary differences between the consolidated financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, and are measured using enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.Apple Inc. | 2019 Form 10-K | 45

Uncertain Tax PositionsAs of September 28, 2019, the total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits was $15.6 billion, of which $8.6 billion, if recognized, would impact the Company’s effective tax rate. As of September 29, 2018, the total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits was $9.7 billion, of which $7.4 billion, if recognized, would have impacted the Company’s effective tax rate.The aggregate change in the balance of gross unrecognized tax benefits, which excludes interest and penalties, for 2019, 2018 and 2017, is as follows (in millions):The Company is subject to taxation and files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and many state and foreign jurisdictions. The U.S. Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”) concluded its review of the years 2013 through 2015 in 2018, and all years before 2016 are closed. Tax years after 2014 remain open in certain major foreign jurisdictions and are subject to examination by the taxing authorities. The Company believes that an adequate provision has been made for any adjustments that may result from tax examinations. However, the outcome of tax audits cannot be predicted with certainty. If any issues addressed in the Company’s tax audits are resolved in a manner inconsistent with its expectations, the Company could be required to adjust its provision for income taxes in the period such resolution occurs. Although the timing of resolution and/or closure of audits is not certain, the Company believes it is reasonably possible that its gross unrecognized tax benefits could decrease in the next 12 months by as much as $2.0 billion.Interest and PenaltiesThe Company includes interest and penalties related to income tax matters within the provision for income taxes. As of September 28, 2019 and September 29, 2018, the total amount of gross interest and penalties accrued was $1.3 billion and $1.4 billion, respectively. The Company recognized interest and penalty expense in 2019, 2018 and 2017 of $73 million, $489 million and $238 million, respectively.European Commission State Aid DecisionOn August 30, 2016, the European Commission announced its decision that Ireland granted state aid to the Company by providing tax opinions in 1991 and 2007 concerning the tax allocation of profits of the Irish branches of two subsidiaries of the Company (the “State Aid Decision”). The State Aid Decision ordered Ireland to calculate and recover additional taxes from the Company for the period June 2003 through December 2014. The recovery amount was calculated to be €13.1 billion, plus interest of €1.2 billion. During the fourth quarter of 2019, the Irish Minister for Finance approved the Company’s request to reduce the recovery amount by €190 million due to taxes paid to other countries, resulting in an adjusted recovery amount of €12.9 billion as of September 28, 2019. Irish legislative changes, effective as of January 2015, eliminated the application of the tax opinions from that date forward. The Company believes the State Aid Decision to be without merit and appealed to the General Court of the Court of Justice of the European Union. Ireland has also appealed the State Aid Decision. The Company believes that any incremental Irish corporate income taxes potentially due related to the State Aid Decision would be creditable against U.S. taxes, subject to any foreign tax credit limitations in the Act. As of September 28, 2019, the entire adjusted recovery amount plus interest was funded into escrow, where it will remain restricted from general use pending the conclusion of all appeals.

Note 6 – DebtCommercial PaperThe Company issues unsecured short-term promissory notes (“Commercial Paper”) pursuant to a commercial paper program. The Company uses net proceeds from the commercial paper program for general corporate purposes, including dividends and share repurchases. As of September 28, 2019 and September 29, 2018, the Company had $6.0 billion and $12.0 billion of Commercial Paper outstanding, respectively, with maturities generally less than nine months. The weighted-average interest rate of the Company’s Commercial Paper was 2.24% and 2.18% as of September 28, 2019 and September 29, 2018, respectively. The following table provides a summary of cash flows associated with the issuance and maturities of Commercial Paper for 2019, 2018 and 2017 (in millions):Term DebtAs of September 28, 2019, the Company had outstanding floating- and fixed-rate notes with varying maturities for an aggregate principal amount of $101.7 billion (collectively the “Notes”). The Notes are senior unsecured obligations and interest is payable in arrears. The following table provides a summary of the Company’s term debt as of September 28, 2019 and September 29, 2018:To manage interest rate risk on certain of its U.S. dollar–denominated fixed- or floating-rate notes, the Company has entered into interest rate swaps to effectively convert the fixed interest rates to floating interest rates or the floating interest rates to fixed interest rates on a portion of these notes. Additionally, to manage foreign currency risk on certain of its foreign currency–denominated notes, the Company has entered into foreign currency swaps to effectively convert these notes to U.S. dollar–denominated notes.A portion of the Company’s Japanese yen–denominated notes is designated as a hedge of the foreign currency exposure of the Company’s net investment in a foreign operation. As of September 28, 2019 and September 29, 2018, the carrying value of the debt designated as a net investment hedge was $1.0 billion and $811 million, respectively. For further discussion regarding the Company’s use of derivative instruments, refer to the Derivative Financial Instruments section of Note 3, “Financial Instruments.”The effective interest rates for the Notes include the interest on the Notes, amortization of the discount or premium and, if applicable, adjustments related to hedging.

The following table shows the changes in AOCI by component for 2019 and 2018 (in millions):Note 9 – Benefit Plans2014 Employee Stock PlanIn the second quarter of 2014, shareholders approved the 2014 Employee Stock Plan (the “2014 Plan”) and terminated the Company’s authority to grant new awards under the 2003 Employee Stock Plan (the “2003 Plan”). The 2014 Plan provides for broad-based equity grants to employees, including executive officers, and permits the granting of RSUs, stock grants, performance-based awards, stock options and stock appreciation rights, as well as cash bonus awards. RSUs granted under the 2014 Plan generally vest over four years, based on continued employment, and are settled upon vesting in shares of the Company’s common stock on a one-for-one basis. RSUs granted under the 2014 Plan reduce the number of shares available for grant under the plan by a factor of two times the number of RSUs granted. RSUs canceled and shares withheld to satisfy tax withholding obligations increase the number of shares available for grant under the 2014 Plan utilizing a factor of two times the number of RSUs canceled or shares withheld. Currently, all RSUs granted under the 2014 Plan have dividend equivalent rights (“DERs”), which entitle holders of RSUs to the same dividend value per share as holders of common stock. DERs are subject to the same vesting and other terms and conditions as the corresponding unvested RSUs. DERs are accumulated and paid when the underlying shares vest. Upon approval of the 2014 Plan, the Company reserved 385 million shares plus the number of shares remaining that were reserved but not issued under the 2003 Plan. Shares subject to outstanding awards under the 2003 Plan that expire, are canceled or otherwise terminate, or are withheld to satisfy tax withholding obligations for RSUs, will also be available for awards under the 2014 Plan. As of September 28, 2019, approximately 246.4 million shares were reserved for future issuance under the 2014 Plan.Apple Inc. Non-Employee Director Stock PlanThe Apple Inc. Non-Employee Director Stock Plan (the “Director Plan”) is a shareholder-approved plan that (i) permits the Company to grant awards of RSUs or stock options to the Company’s non-employee directors, (ii) provides for automatic initial grants of RSUs upon a non-employee director joining the Board of Directors and automatic annual grants of RSUs at each annual meeting of shareholders, and (iii) permits the Board of Directors to prospectively change the value and relative mixture of stock options and RSUs for the initial and annual award grants and the methodology for determining the number of shares of the Company’s common stock subject to these grants, in each case within the limits set forth in the Director Plan and without further shareholder approval. RSUs granted under the Director Plan reduce the number of shares available for grant under the plan by a factor of two times the number of RSUs granted. The Director Plan expires on November 12, 2027. All RSUs granted under the Director Plan are entitled to DERs. DERs are subject to the same vesting and other terms and conditions as the corresponding unvested RSUs. DERs are accumulated and paid when the underlying shares vest. As of September 28, 2019, approximately 1.1 million shares were reserved for future issuance under the Director Plan.Apple Inc. | 2019 Form 10-K | 49

Rule 10b5-1 Trading PlansDuring the three months ended September 28, 2019, Section 16 officers Timothy D. Cook, Chris Kondo, Luca Maestri, Deirdre O’Brien and Jeffrey Williams had equity trading plans in place in accordance with Rule 10b5-1(c)(1) under the Exchange Act. An equity trading plan is a written document that pre-establishes the amounts, prices and dates (or formula for determining the amounts, prices and dates) of future purchases or sales of the Company’s stock, including shares acquired under the Company’s employee and director equity plans.Employee Stock Purchase PlanThe Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the “Purchase Plan”) is a shareholder-approved plan under which substantially all employees may purchase the Company’s common stock through payroll deductions at a price equal to 85% of the lower of the fair market values of the stock as of the beginning or the end of six-month offering periods. An employee’s payroll deductions under the Purchase Plan are limited to 10% of the employee’s compensation and employees may not purchase more than $25,000 of stock during any calendar year. As of September 28, 2019, approximately 31.1 million shares were reserved for future issuance under the Purchase Plan.401(k) PlanThe Company’s 401(k) Plan is a deferred salary arrangement under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code. Under the 401(k) Plan, participating U.S. employees may defer a portion of their pre-tax earnings, up to the IRS annual contribution limit ($19,000 for calendar year 2019). The Company matches 50% to 100% of each employee’s contributions, depending on length of service, up to a maximum of 6% of the employee’s eligible earnings.Restricted Stock UnitsA summary of the Company’s RSU activity and related information for 2019, 2018 and 2017, is as follows:The fair value as of the respective vesting dates of RSUs was $8.6 billion, $7.6 billion and $6.1 billion for 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The majority of RSUs that vested in 2019, 2018 and 2017 were net share settled such that the Company withheld shares with a value equivalent to the employees’ obligation for the applicable income and other employment taxes, and remitted the cash to the appropriate taxing authorities. The total shares withheld were approximately 14.8 million, 16.0 million and 15.4 million for 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively, and were based on the value of the RSUs on their respective vesting dates as determined by the Company’s closing stock price. Total payments for the employees’ tax obligations to taxing authorities were $3.0 billion, $2.7 billion and $2.0 billion in 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. These net share settlements had the effect of share repurchases by the Company as they reduced the number of shares that would have otherwise been issued as a result of the vesting and did not represent an expense to the Company.Apple Inc. | 2019 Form 10-K | 50

Share-Based CompensationThe following table shows share-based compensation expense and the related income tax benefit included in the Consolidated Statements of Operations for 2019, 2018 and 2017 (in millions):As of September 28, 2019, the total unrecognized compensation cost related to outstanding RSUs and stock options was $10.5 billion, which the Company expects to recognize over a weighted-average period of 2.5 years.Note 10 – Commitments and ContingenciesAccrued Warranty and GuaranteesThe following table shows changes in the Company’s accrued warranties and related costs for 2019, 2018 and 2017 (in millions):The Company offers an iPhone Upgrade Program, which is available to customers who purchase a qualifying iPhone in the U.S., the U.K. and mainland China. The iPhone Upgrade Program provides customers the right to trade in that iPhone for a specified amount when purchasing a new iPhone, provided certain conditions are met. The Company accounts for the trade-in right as a guarantee liability and recognizes arrangement revenue net of the fair value of such right, with subsequent changes to the guarantee liability recognized within net sales.Concentrations in the Available Sources of Supply of Materials and ProductAlthough most components essential to the Company’s business are generally available from multiple sources, certain components are currently obtained from single or limited sources. The Company also competes for various components with other participants in the markets for smartphones, personal computers, tablets and other electronic devices. Therefore, many components used by the Company, including those that are available from multiple sources, are at times subject to industry-wide shortage and significant commodity pricing fluctuations.The Company uses some custom components that are not commonly used by its competitors, and new products introduced by the Company often utilize custom components available from only one source. When a component or product uses new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers’ yields have matured or their manufacturing capacities have increased. The continued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at all, may be affected if suppliers decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the Company’s requirements.The Company has entered into agreements for the supply of many components; however, there can be no guarantee that the Company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms, or at all.Substantially all of the Company’s hardware products are manufactured by outsourcing partners that are located primarily in Asia, with some Mac computers manufactured in the U.S. and Ireland.Other Off–Balance Sheet CommitmentsOperating LeasesThe Company leases various equipment and facilities, including retail space, under noncancelable operating lease arrangements. The Company does not currently utilize any other off–balance sheet financing arrangements. As of September 28, 2019, the Company’s total future minimum lease payments under noncancelable operating leases were $10.8 billion. The Company’s retail store and other facility leases typically have original terms not exceeding 10 years and generally contain multi-year renewal options.Apple Inc. | 2019 Form 10-K | 51

Rent expense under all operating leases, including both cancelable and noncancelable leases, was $1.3 billion, $1.2 billion and $1.1 billion in 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Future minimum lease payments under noncancelable operating leases having initial or remaining terms in excess of one year as of September 28, 2019, are as follows (in millions):Unconditional Purchase ObligationsThe Company has entered into certain off–balance sheet commitments that require the future purchase of goods or services (“unconditional purchase obligations”). The Company’s unconditional purchase obligations primarily consist of payments for supplier arrangements, Internet and telecommunication services, intellectual property licenses and content creation. Future payments under noncancelable unconditional purchase obligations having a remaining term in excess of one year as of September 28, 2019, are as follows (in millions):ContingenciesThe Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that have arisen in the ordinary course of business and that have not been fully resolved. The outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain. If one or more legal matters were resolved against the Company in a reporting period for amounts above management’s expectations, the Company’s financial condition and operating results for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected. In the opinion of management, there was not at least a reasonable possibility the Company may have incurred a material loss, or a material loss greater than a recorded accrual, concerning loss contingencies for asserted legal and other claims, except for the following matters:VirnetXVirnetX, Inc. (“VirnetX”) filed two lawsuits in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas (the “Eastern Texas District Court”) against the Company alleging that certain Company products infringe four patents (the “VirnetX Patents”) relating to network communications technology (“VirnetX I” and “VirnetX II”). On September 30, 2016, a jury returned a verdict in VirnetX I against the Company and awarded damages of $302 million, which later increased to $440 million in post-trial proceedings. The Company appealed the VirnetX I verdict to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (the “Federal Circuit”). On April 11, 2018, a jury returned a verdict in VirnetX II against the Company and awarded damages of $503 million. VirnetX II is currently on appeal. The Company has challenged the validity of the VirnetX Patents at the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (the “PTO”). In response, the PTO has declared the VirnetX Patents invalid. VirnetX appealed the invalidity decision of the PTO to the Federal Circuit. The Federal Circuit consolidated the Company’s appeal of the Eastern Texas District Court VirnetX I verdict and VirnetX’s appeals from the PTO invalidity proceedings. On January 15, 2019, the Federal Circuit affirmed the VirnetX I verdict, which the Company intends to further appeal. On July 8, 2019, the Federal Circuit remanded one of VirnetX’s two appeals of the PTO’s invalidity decisions back to the PTO for further proceedings. On August 1, 2019, the Federal Circuit affirmed-in-part, vacated-in-part, and remanded back to the PTO portions of VirnetX’s second appeal. The Company has accrued its best estimate for the ultimate resolution of these matters.Apple Inc. | 2019 Form 10-K | 52



QualcommOn January 20, 2017, the Company filed a lawsuit against Qualcomm Incorporated and affiliated parties (“Qualcomm”) in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California seeking, among other things, to enjoin Qualcomm from requiring the Company to pay royalties at the rate demanded by Qualcomm. No Qualcomm-related royalty payments had been remitted by the Company to its contract manufacturers since the beginning of the second quarter of 2017. Following the Company’s lawsuit, Qualcomm filed patent infringement suits against the Company and its affiliates in the U.S. and various international jurisdictions, some of which sought to enjoin the sale of certain of the Company’s products in particular countries.On April 16, 2019, the Company and Qualcomm reached a settlement agreement to dismiss all litigation between the two companies worldwide. The companies also reached a multi-year license agreement and a multi-year supply agreement. Under the terms of the settlement agreement, Apple made a payment to Qualcomm to, among other things, resolve disputes over the withheld royalty payments.iOS Performance Management CasesVarious civil litigation matters have been filed in state and federal courts in the U.S. and in various international jurisdictions alleging violation of consumer protection laws, fraud, computer intrusion and other causes of action related to the Company’s performance management feature used in its iPhone operating systems, introduced to certain iPhones in iOS updates 10.2.1 and 11.2. The claims seek monetary damages and other non-monetary relief. On April 5, 2018, several U.S. federal actions were consolidated through a Multidistrict Litigation process into a single action in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California. In addition to civil litigation, the Company is also responding to governmental investigations and requests for information relating to the performance management feature. The Company believes that its iPhones were not defective, that the performance management feature introduced with iOS updates 10.2.1 and 11.2 was intended to, and did, improve customers’ user experience, and that the Company did not make any misleading statements or fail to disclose any material information. The Company has accrued its best estimate for the ultimate resolution of these matters.French Competition AuthorityIn June 2019, the French Competition Authority (“FCA”) issued a report alleging that aspects of the Company’s sales and distribution practices in France violate French competition law. The Company vigorously disagrees with the allegations, and a hearing of arguments was held before the FCA on October 15, 2019. The Company is awaiting the decision of the FCA, which may include a fine.Note 11 – Segment Information and Geographic DataThe Company reports segment information based on the “management” approach. The management approach designates the internal reporting used by management for making decisions and assessing performance as the source of the Company’s reportable segments.The Company manages its business primarily on a geographic basis. The Company’s reportable segments consist of the Americas, Europe, Greater China, Japan and Rest of Asia Pacific. Americas includes both North and South America. Europe includes European countries, as well as India, the Middle East and Africa. Greater China includes China, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Rest of Asia Pacific includes Australia and those Asian countries not included in the Company’s other reportable segments. Although the reportable segments provide similar hardware and software products and similar services, each one is managed separately to better align with the location of the Company’s customers and distribution partners and the unique market dynamics of each geographic region. The accounting policies of the various segments are the same as those described in Note 1, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.”The Company evaluates the performance of its reportable segments based on net sales and operating income. Net sales for geographic segments are generally based on the location of customers and sales through the Company’s retail stores located in those geographic locations. Operating income for each segment includes net sales to third parties, related cost of sales and operating expenses directly attributable to the segment. Advertising expenses are generally included in the geographic segment in which the expenditures are incurred. Operating income for each segment excludes other income and expense and certain expenses managed outside the reportable segments. Costs excluded from segment operating income include various corporate expenses such as research and development, corporate marketing expenses, certain share-based compensation expenses, income taxes, various nonrecurring charges and other separately managed general and administrative costs. The Company does not include intercompany transfers between segments for management reporting purposes.Apple Inc. | 2019 Form 10-K | 53

A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate./s/ Ernst & Young LLPSan Jose, CaliforniaOctober 30, 2019Apple Inc. | 2019 Form 10-K | 58

## Item 1A


uncertainty about current global economic conditions could also continue to increase the
volatility of the companys stock price.global markets for personal computers, mobile communication devices, digital
music and video devices, and related peripherals and services are highly competitive and subject to rapid technological change. if the company is unable to compete effectively in these markets, its financial condition and operating results could be
materially adversely affected.the company competes in highly competitive global markets characterized by aggressive price
cutting, with resulting downward pressure on gross margins, frequent introduction of new products, short product life cycles, evolving industry standards, continual improvement in product price/performance characteristics, rapid adoption of
technological and product advancements by competitors, and price sensitivity on the part of consumers.the companys
ability to compete successfully depends heavily on its ability to ensure a continuing and timely introduction of innovative new products and technologies to the marketplace. the company believes it is unique in that it designs and develops nearly
the entire solution for its personal computers, mobile communication devices, and consumer electronics, including the hardware, operating system, numerous software applications, and related services. as a result, the company must make significant
investments in research and development and as such, the company currently holds a significant number of patents and copyrights and has registered and/or has applied to register numerous patents, trademarks and service marks. by contrast, many of
the companys competitors seek to compete primarily through aggressive pricing and very low cost structures. if the company is unable to continue to develop and sell innovative new products with attractive margins or if other companies infringe
on the companys intellectual property, the companys ability to maintain a competitive advantage could be negatively affected and its financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected.in the market for personal computers and peripherals, the company faces a significant number of competitors, many of which have broader
product lines, lower priced products, and larger installed customer bases. consolidation in this market has resulted in larger and potentially stronger competitors. price competition has been particularly intense as competitors selling windows-based
personal computers have aggressively cut prices and lowered product margins. the company also faces increased competition in key market segments, including consumer, smb, education, enterprise, government and creative markets. an increasing number
of internet devices that include software applications and are smaller and simpler than traditional personal computers compete for market share with the companys existing products.the company is currently the only authorized maker of hardware using the mac os. the mac os has a minority market share in the personal computer market, which is dominated by
computer makers using competing operating systems, most notably windows. the companys financial condition and operating results depend substantially on the companys ability to continually improve the mac platform to maintain functional
and design advantages. use of unauthorized copies of the mac os on other companies hardware products may result in decreased demand for the companys hardware products, and could materially adversely affect the companys financial
condition and operating results.the company is currently focused on certain mobile communication devices, such as iphone,
consumer electronic devices, including the ipod family of digital music and video players and third-party digital content and applications distribution. the company faces substantial competition from companies that have significant technical,
marketing, distribution and other resources, as well as established hardware, software and digital content supplier relationships. the company also competes with illegitimate ways to obtain third-party digital content and applications. the company
has only recently entered the mobile communications market, and many of its competitors in the mobile communications market have significantly greater experience, product breadth and distribution channels than the company. because some current and
potential competitors have substantial resources and experience and a lower cost structure, they may be able to provide such products and services at little or no profit or even at a loss. the company also expects competition to intensify as
competitors attempt to14



imitate the companys approach to providing these components seamlessly within their individual offerings or work collaboratively to offer integrated solutions.the company currently receives subsidies from its exclusive and non-exclusive carriers providing cellular network service for iphone. there
is no assurance that such subsidies will be continued at all or in the same amounts upon renewal of the companys agreements with these carriers or in agreements the company enters into with new carriers.there can be no assurance the company will be able to continue to provide products and services that compete effectively.to remain competitive and stimulate customer demand, the company must successfully manage frequent product introductions and transitions.due to the highly volatile and competitive nature of the personal computer, mobile communication and consumer electronics
industries, the company must continually introduce new products, services and technologies, enhance existing products and services, and effectively stimulate customer demand for new and upgraded products. the success of new product introductions
depends on a number of factors including but not limited to timely and successful product development, market acceptance, the companys ability to manage the risks associated with new products and production ramp issues, the availability of
application software for new products, the effective management of purchase commitments and inventory levels in line with anticipated product demand, the availability of products in appropriate quantities and costs to meet anticipated demand, and
the risk that new products may have quality or other defects in the early stages of introduction. accordingly, the company cannot determine in advance the ultimate effect of new product introductions and transitions on its financial condition and
operating results.the company faces substantial inventory and other asset risk.the company records a write-down for product and component inventories that have become obsolete or exceed anticipated demand or net
realizable value and accrues necessary cancellation fee reserves for orders of excess products and components. the company also reviews its long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changed circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an
asset may not be recoverable. if the company determines that impairment has occurred, it records a write-down equal to the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds its fair market value. although the company believes its inventory
and other asset related provisions are currently adequate, no assurance can be given that, given the rapid and unpredictable pace of product obsolescence in the global personal computer, mobile communication, and consumer electronics industries, the
company will not incur additional inventory or asset related charges. such charges have, and could, materially adversely affect the companys financial condition and operating results.the company must order components for its products and build inventory in advance of product announcements and shipments. consistent with industry practice, components are normally
acquired through a combination of purchase orders, supplier contracts, open orders and, where appropriate, prepayments, in each case based on projected demand. such purchase commitments typically cover forecasted component and manufacturing
requirements for 30 to 150 days. because the companys markets are volatile, competitive and subject to rapid technology and price changes, there is a risk the company will forecast incorrectly and order or produce excess or insufficient
inventories of components or products. the companys financial condition and operating results have been in the past and could be in the future materially adversely affected by the companys ability to manage its inventory levels and
respond to short-term shifts in customer demand patterns.future operating results depend upon the companys ability
to obtain key components including but not limited to microprocessors, nand flash memory, dram and lcds at favorable prices and in sufficient quantities.because the company currently obtains certain key components including but not limited to microprocessors, enclosures, certain lcds, certain optical drives, and asics, from single or limited sources, the
company is15



subject to significant supply and pricing risks. many of these and other key components that are available from multiple sources including but not limited to nand flash memory, dram and certain
lcds, are subject at times to industry-wide shortages and significant commodity pricing fluctuations. the company has entered into certain agreements for the supply of key components including but not limited to microprocessors, nand flash memory,
dram and lcds at favorable pricing, but there is no guarantee that the company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar favorable terms, or at all, upon expiration or otherwise obtain favorable pricing in the future. the follow-on
effects from the credit crisis on the companys key suppliers, referred to in economic conditions could materially adversely affect the company above, which is incorporated herein by reference, also could affect the
companys ability to obtain key components. therefore, the company remains subject to significant risks of supply shortages and/or price increases that could materially adversely affect the companys financial condition and operating
results. the company expects to experience decreases in its gross margin percentage in future periods, as compared to levels achieved during 2009 and 2008, due largely to the anticipated impact of product transitions, flat or reduced pricing on new
and innovative products that have higher cost structures, both expected and potential future cost increases for key components, a stronger u.s. dollar and higher logistical costs. for additional information refer to part ii, item 7,
managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations, under the subheading gross margin, which is incorporated herein by reference.the company and other participants in the personal computer, mobile communication and consumer electronics industries compete for various
components with other industries that have experienced increased demand for their products. the company uses some custom components that are not common to the rest of the personal computer, mobile communication and consumer electronics industries.
the companys new products often utilize custom components available from only one source until the company has evaluated whether there is a need for, and subsequently qualifies, additional suppliers. when a component or product uses new
technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers yields have matured or manufacturing capacity has increased. continued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at all, may be affected if those
suppliers decided to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the companys requirements. if the supply of a key single-sourced component for a new or existing product were delayed or
constrained, if such components were available only at significantly higher prices, or if a key manufacturing vendor delayed shipments of completed products to the company, the companys financial condition and operating results could be
materially adversely affected.the company depends on component and product manufacturing and logistical services provided
by third parties, many of whom are located outside of the u.s.most of the companys components and products are
manufactured in whole or in part by a few third-party manufacturers. many of these manufacturers are located outside of the u.s., and are concentrated in several general locations. the company has also outsourced much of its transportation and
logistics management. while these arrangements may lower operating costs, they also reduce the companys direct control over production and distribution. it is uncertain what effect such diminished control will have on the quality or quantity
of products or services, or the companys flexibility to respond to changing conditions. in addition, the company relies on third-party manufacturers to adhere to the companys supplier code of conduct. although arrangements with such
manufacturers may contain provisions for warranty expense reimbursement, the company may remain responsible to the consumer for warranty service in the event of product defects. any unanticipated product defect or warranty liability, whether
pursuant to arrangements with contract manufacturers or otherwise, could materially adversely affect the companys reputation, financial condition and operating results.final assembly of the companys products is currently performed in the companys manufacturing facility in ireland, and by external vendors in california, texas, china, the
czech republic and korea. currently, the supply and manufacture of many critical components is performed by sole-sourced third-party vendors in the u.s., china, germany, ireland, israel japan, korea, malaysia, the netherlands, the philippines,
taiwan, thailand and singapore. sole-sourced third-party vendors in china perform final assembly of substantially all of the16



companys portable mac products, iphones, ipods and most of the companys desktop products. if manufacturing or logistics in these locations is disrupted for any reason, including
natural disasters, information technology system failures, military actions or economic, business, labor, environmental, public health, or political issues, the companys financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely
affected.the company relies on third-party digital content and applications, which may not be available to the company on
commercially reasonable terms or at all.the company contracts with certain third parties to offer their digital content
and applications through the companys itunes store. the company pays substantial fees to obtain the rights to audio and video content. the companys licensing arrangements with these third parties are short-term and do not guarantee the
continuation or renewal of these arrangements on reasonable terms, if at all. some third-party content providers currently or in the future may offer competing products and services, and could take action to make it more difficult or impossible for
the company to license their content in the future. other content owners, providers or distributors may seek to limit the companys access to, or increase the total cost of, such content. if the company is unable to continue to offer a wide
variety of content at reasonable prices with acceptable usage rules, or continue to expand its geographic reach, the companys financial condition and operating results may be materially adversely affected.many third-party content providers require that the company provide certain digital rights management (drm) and other security
solutions. if these requirements change, the company may have to develop or license new technology to provide these solutions. there is no assurance the company will be able to develop or license such solutions at a reasonable cost and in a timely
manner. in addition, certain countries have passed or may propose legislation that would force the company to license its drm, which could lessen the protection of content and subject it to piracy and also could affect arrangements with the
companys content providers.the company relies on access to third-party patents and intellectual property, and the
companys future results could be materially adversely affected if it is alleged or found to have infringed intellectual property rights.many of the companys products are designed to include third-party intellectual property, and in the future the company may need to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of its products
and business methods. although the company believes that, based on past experience and industry practice, such licenses generally could be obtained on reasonable terms, there is no assurance that the necessary licenses would be available on
acceptable terms or at all.because of technological changes in the global personal computer, mobile communication and
consumer electronics industries, current extensive patent coverage, and the rapid issuance of new patents, it is possible that certain components of the companys products and business methods may unknowingly infringe the patents or other
intellectual property rights of third parties. from time to time, the company has been notified that it may be infringing such rights. regardless of merit, responding to such claims can consume significant time and expense. at present, the company
is vigorously defending more than 47 patent infringement cases, 27 of which were filed during fiscal 2009, and several pending claims are in various stages of evaluation. in certain cases, the company may consider the desirability of entering into
licensing agreements, although no assurance can be given that such licenses can be obtained on acceptable terms or that litigation will not occur. if the company is found to be infringing such rights, it may be required to pay substantial damages.
if there is a temporary or permanent injunction prohibiting the company from marketing or selling certain products or a successful claim of infringement against the company requires it to pay royalties to a third party, the companys financial
condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected, regardless of whether it can develop non-infringing technology. while in managements opinion the company does not have a potential liability for damages or royalties from
any known current legal proceedings or claims related to the infringement of patent or other intellectual property rights that would individually or in the aggregate materially adversely affect its financial condition and operating results, the
results of such legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty. should17



the company fail to prevail in any of the matters related to infringement of patent or other intellectual property rights of others or should several of these matters be resolved against the
company in the same reporting period, the companys financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected.with the june 2007 introduction of iphone, the company has begun to compete with mobile communication device companies that hold significant patent portfolios. regardless of the scope or validity of
such patents or the merits of any potential patent claims by competitors, the company may have to engage in protracted litigation, enter into expensive agreements or settlements and/or modify its products. any of these events could
have a material adverse impact on the companys financial condition and operating results.the companys future
performance depends on support from third-party software developers. if third-party software applications and services cease to be developed and maintained for the companys products, customers may choose not to buy the companys products.the company believes decisions by customers to purchase its hardware products, including its macs, iphones and ipods, are
often based to a certain extent on the availability of third-party software applications and services. there is no assurance that third-party developers will continue to develop and maintain applications and services for the companys products
on a timely basis or at all, and discontinuance or delay of these applications and services could materially adversely affect the companys financial condition and operating results.with respect to its mac products, the company believes the availability of third-party software applications and services depends in part on the developers perception and
analysis of the relative benefits of developing, maintaining, and upgrading such software for the companys products compared to windows-based products. this analysis may be based on factors such as the perceived strength of the company and its
products, the anticipated revenue that may be generated, continued acceptance by customers of mac os x, and the costs of developing such applications and services. if the companys minority share of the global personal computer market causes
developers to question the companys prospects, developers could be less inclined to develop or upgrade software for the companys products and more inclined to devote their resources to developing and upgrading software for the larger
windows market. the companys development of its own software applications and services may also negatively affect the decisions of third-party developers, such as microsoft, adobe and google, to develop, maintain, and upgrade similar or
competitive software and services for the companys products. mac os x version 10.5 leopard (mac os x leopard), which became available in october 2007, includes a new feature that enables intel-based mac systems to run microsoft
windows xp and windows vista operating systems. this feature may deter developers from creating software applications for mac os x if such applications are already available for the windows platform.with respect to iphone and ipod touch, the company relies on the continued availability and development of compelling and innovative
software applications. unlike third-party software applications for mac products, the software applications for the iphone and ipod touch platforms are distributed through a single distribution channel, the app store. the absence of multiple
distribution channels, which are available for competing platforms, may limit the availability and acceptance of third-party applications by the companys customers, thereby causing developers to curtail significantly, or stop, development for
the companys platforms. in addition, iphone and ipod touch are subject to rapid technological change, and, if third-party developers are unable to keep up with this pace of change, third-party applications might not successfully operate and
may result in dissatisfied customers. further, if the company develops its own software applications and services, such development may negatively affect the decisions of third-party developers to develop, maintain, and upgrade similar or
competitive applications for the iphone and ipod touch platforms. as with applications for the companys mac products, the availability and development of these applications also depend on developers perceptions and analysis of the
relative benefits of developing software for the companys products rather than its competitors products, including devices that use competing platforms. if developers focus their efforts on these competing platforms, the availability and
quality of applications for the companys devices may suffer.18



the companys future operating performance depends on the performance of
distributors, carriers and other resellers.the company distributes its products through wholesalers, resellers, national
and regional retailers, value-added resellers, and cataloguers, many of whom distribute products from competing manufacturers. the company also sells many of its products and resells third-party products in most of its major markets directly to
end-users, certain education customers, and certain resellers through its online and retail stores. iphone is distributed through the company, its cellular network carriers distribution channels and certain third-party resellers.many resellers operate on narrow operating margins and have been negatively affected in the past by weak economic conditions. some
resellers have perceived the expansion of the companys direct sales as conflicting with their business interests as distributors and resellers of the companys products. such a perception could discourage resellers from investing
resources in the distribution and sale of the companys products or lead them to limit or cease distribution of those products. the companys financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected if the financial
condition of these resellers weakens, if resellers stopped distributing the companys products, or if uncertainty regarding demand for the companys products caused resellers to reduce their ordering and marketing of the companys
products. the company has invested and will continue to invest in programs to enhance reseller sales, including staffing selected resellers stores with company employees and contractors and improving product placement displays. these programs
could require a substantial investment while providing no assurance of return or incremental revenue.the companys
retail business has required and will continue to require a substantial investment and commitment of resources and is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties.through september 26, 2009, the company had opened 273 retail stores. the companys retail stores have required substantial fixed investment in equipment and leasehold improvements, information
systems, inventory and personnel. the company also has entered into substantial operating lease commitments for retail space with terms ranging from five to 20 years, the majority of which are for ten years. certain stores have been designed and
built to serve as high-profile venues to promote brand awareness and serve as vehicles for corporate sales and marketing activities. because of their unique design elements, locations and size, these stores require substantially more investment than
the companys more typical retail stores. due to the high fixed cost structure associated with the retail segment, a decline in sales or the closure or poor performance of individual or multiple stores could result in significant lease
termination costs, write-offs of equipment and leasehold improvements, and severance costs that could materially adversely affect the companys financial condition and operating results.many factors unique to retail operations, some of which are beyond the companys control, pose risks and uncertainties that could materially adversely affect the companys
financial condition and operating results. these risks and uncertainties include, among other things, macro-economic factors that could have a negative effect on general retail activity, as well as the companys inability to manage costs
associated with store construction and operation, inability to sell third-party products at adequate margins, failure to manage relationships with existing retail channel partners, more challenging environment in managing retail operations outside
the u.s., costs associated with unanticipated fluctuations in the value of retail inventory, and inability to obtain and renew leases in quality retail locations at a reasonable cost.investment in new business strategies and initiatives could disrupt the companys ongoing business and present risks not originally contemplated.the company has invested, and in the future may invest, in new business strategies or acquisitions. such endeavors may involve significant
risks and uncertainties, including distraction of management from current operations, insufficient revenue to offset liabilities assumed and expenses associated with the strategy, inadequate return of capital, and unidentified issues not discovered
in the companys due diligence. because19



these new ventures are inherently risky, no assurance can be given that such strategies and initiatives will be successful and will not materially adversely affect the companys financial
condition and operating results.the companys products and services experience quality problems from time to time
that can result in decreased sales and operating margin.the company sells highly complex hardware and software products
and services that can contain defects in design and manufacture. sophisticated operating system software and applications, such as those sold by the company, often contain bugs that can unexpectedly interfere with the softwares
intended operation. defects may also occur in components and products the company purchases from third parties. there can be no assurance the company will be able to detect and fix all defects in the hardware, software and services it sells. failure
to do so could result in lost revenue, harm to reputation, and significant warranty and other expenses, and could have a material adverse impact on the companys financial condition and operating results.in certain countries, including the u.s., the company relies on a single cellular network carrier to provide service for iphone.in the u.s., germany, spain, ireland and certain other countries, the company has contracted with a single carrier to provide
cellular network services for iphone on an exclusive basis. if these exclusive carriers cannot successfully compete with other carriers in their markets on any basis, including but not limited to the quality and coverage of wireless voice and data
services, performance and timely build-out of advanced wireless networks, and pricing and other terms of conditions of end-user contracts, or if these exclusive carriers fail to promote iphone aggressively or favor other handsets in their promotion
and sales activities or service plans, sales may be materially adversely affected.the company is subject to risks
associated with laws, regulations and industry-imposed standards related to mobile communications devices.laws and
regulations related to mobile communications devices in the many jurisdictions in which the company operates are extensive and subject to change. such changes, which could include but are not limited to restrictions on production, manufacture,
distribution, and use of the device, locking the device to a carriers network, or mandating the use of the device on more than one carriers network, could materially adversely affect the companys financial condition and operating
results.mobile communication devices, such as iphone, are subject to certification and regulation by governmental and
standardization bodies, as well as by cellular network carriers for use on their networks. these certification processes are extensive and time consuming, and could result in additional testing requirements, product modifications or delays in
product shipment dates, which could materially adversely affect the companys financial condition and operating results.the companys success depends largely on the continued service and availability of key personnel.much of
the companys future success depends on the continued availability and service of key personnel, including its ceo, its executive team and highly skilled employees in technical, marketing and staff positions. experienced personnel in the
technology industry are in high demand and competition for their talents is intense, especially in the silicon valley, where most of the companys key personnel are located. there can be no assurance that the company will continue to attract
and retain key personnel.in addition, the company has relied on equity awards in the form of stock options and restricted
stock units as one means for recruiting and retaining highly skilled talent. significant adverse volatility in the companys stock price could result in a stock options exercise price exceeding the underlying stocks market value or
a significant deterioration in the value of restricted stock units granted, thus lessening the effectiveness of stock-based awards for retaining employees.20



political events, war, terrorism, public health issues, natural disasters and other
circumstances could materially adversely affect the company.war, terrorism, geopolitical uncertainties, public health
issues, and other business interruptions have caused and could cause damage or disruption to international commerce and the global economy, and thus could have a strong negative effect on the company, its suppliers, logistics providers,
manufacturing vendors and customers, including channel partners. the companys business operations are subject to interruption by natural disasters, fire, power shortages, terrorist attacks, and other hostile acts, labor disputes, public health
issues, and other events beyond its control. such events could decrease demand for the companys products, make it difficult or impossible for the company to make and deliver products to its customers, including channel partners, or to receive
components from its suppliers, and create delays and inefficiencies in the companys supply chain. should major public health issues, including pandemics, arise, the company could be negatively affected by more stringent employee travel
restrictions, additional limitations in freight services, governmental actions limiting the movement of products between regions, delays in production ramps of new products, and disruptions in the operations of the companys manufacturing
vendors and component suppliers. the majority of the companys research and development activities, its corporate headquarters, information technology systems, and other critical business operations, including certain component suppliers and
manufacturing vendors, are located near major seismic faults. because the company does not carry earthquake insurance for direct quake-related losses and significant recovery time could be required to resume operations, the companys financial
condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected in the event of a major earthquake.the company may
be subject to information technology system failures, network disruptions and breaches in data security.information
technology system failures, network disruptions and breaches of data security caused by such factors including without limitation earthquakes, fire, theft, or other causes could disrupt the companys operations by causing delays or cancellation
of customer, including channel partner, orders, negatively affecting the companys online, itunes, mobileme and retail offerings and services, impeding the manufacture or shipment of products, processing transactions and reporting financial
results, resulting in the unintentional disclosure of customer or company information, or damage to the companys reputation. while management has taken steps to address these concerns by implementing sophisticated network security and internal
control measures, there can be no assurance that a system failure or loss or data security breach will not materially adversely affect the companys financial condition and operating results.the company expects its quarterly revenue and operating results to fluctuate for a variety of reasons.the companys profit margins vary among its products and its distribution channels. the companys software, accessories, and
service and support contracts generally have higher gross margins than certain of the companys other products. gross margins on the companys hardware products vary across product lines and can change over time as a result of product
transitions, pricing and configuration changes, and component, warranty, and other cost fluctuations. the companys direct sales generally have higher associated gross margins than its indirect sales through its channel partners. in addition,
the companys gross margin and operating margin percentages, as well as overall profitability, may be materially adversely impacted as a result of a shift in product, geographic or channel mix, new products, component cost increases,
strengthening u.s. dollar, or price competition. the company has typically experienced greater net sales in the first and fourth fiscal quarters compared to the second and third fiscal quarters due to seasonal demand related to the holiday season
and the beginning of the school year, respectively. furthermore, the company sells more products from time-to-time during the third month of a quarter than it does during either of the first two months. developments late in a quarter, such as
lower-than-anticipated demand for the companys products, an internal systems failure, or failure of one of the companys key logistics, components supply, or manufacturing partners, could have a material adverse impact on the
companys financial condition and operating results.21



the companys stock price continues to be volatile.the companys stock has at times experienced substantial price volatility due to a number of factors, including but not limited to
variations between its actual and anticipated financial results, announcements by the company and its competitors, and uncertainty about current global economic conditions. the stock market as a whole also has experienced extreme price and volume
fluctuations that have affected the market price of many technology companies in ways that may have been unrelated to these companies operating performance. furthermore, the company believes its stock price reflects high future growth and
profitability expectations. if the company fails to meet these expectations its stock price may significantly decline.the
companys business is subject to the risks of international operations.the company derives a large and growing
portion of its revenue and earnings from its international operations. compliance with u.s. and foreign laws and regulations that apply to the companys international operations, including without limitation import and export requirements, the
foreign corrupt practices act, tax laws (including u.s. taxes on foreign subsidiaries), foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions, data privacy requirements, labor laws, and anti-competition regulations, increases the costs of
doing business in foreign jurisdictions, and such costs may rise in the future as a result of changes in these laws and regulations or in their interpretation. furthermore, the company has implemented policies and procedures designed to facilitate
compliance with these laws and regulations, but there can be no assurance that the companys employees, contractors, or agents will not violate such laws and regulations or the companys policies. any such violations could individually or
in the aggregate materially adversely affect the companys financial condition or operating results.the companys
financial condition and operating results also could be significantly affected by other risks associated with international activities, including but not limited to, economic and labor conditions, political instability, and changes in the value of
the u.s. dollar versus local currencies. margins on sales of the companys products in foreign countries, and on sales of products that include components obtained from foreign suppliers, could be materially adversely affected by foreign
currency exchange rate fluctuations and by international trade regulations, including duties, tariffs and antidumping penalties.the companys primary exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates relate to non-u.s. dollar denominated sales in europe, japan, australia, canada and certain parts of asia, as well as non-u.s. dollar denominated operating
expenses incurred throughout the world. weakening of foreign currencies relative to the u.s. dollar will adversely affect the u.s. dollar value of the companys foreign currency-denominated sales and earnings, and generally will lead the
company to raise international pricing, potentially reducing demand for the companys products. in some circumstances, due to competition or other reasons, the company may decide not to raise local prices to the full extent of the dollars
strengthening, or at all, which would adversely affect the u.s. dollar value of the companys foreign currency denominated sales and earnings. conversely, a strengthening of foreign currencies, while generally beneficial to the companys
foreign currency-denominated sales and earnings, could cause the company to reduce international pricing, thereby limiting the benefit. additionally, strengthening of foreign currencies may also increase the companys cost of product components
denominated in those currencies, thus adversely affecting gross margins.the company has used derivative instruments, such as
foreign currency forward and option contracts, to hedge certain exposures to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. the use of such hedging activities may not offset any or more than a portion of the adverse financial effects of
unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates over the limited time the hedges are in place.the company is exposed to
credit risk and fluctuations in the market values of its investment portfolio.although the company has not recognized any
material losses on its cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, any significant future declines in their market values could materially adversely affect the companys financial condition and operating results. given the global nature
of its business, the company has investments22



both domestically and internationally. additionally, the companys overall investment portfolio has concentrations in the financial sector, which has been negatively impacted by adverse
market liquidity conditions in the recent past. credit ratings and pricing of these investments can be negatively impacted by liquidity, credit deterioration or losses, financial results, or other factors. as a result, the value or liquidity of the
companys cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities could decline and result in a material impairment, which could materially adversely affect the companys financial condition and operating results.the company is exposed to credit risk on its accounts receivable and prepayments related to long-term supply agreements. this risk is
heightened during periods when economic conditions worsen.a substantial majority of the companys outstanding trade
receivables are not covered by collateral or credit insurance. the company also has unsecured non-trade receivables resulting from purchases of components by contract manufacturers and other vendors that manufacture sub-assemblies or assemble final
products for the company. in addition, the company has made prepayments associated with long-term supply agreements to secure supply of certain inventory components. while the company has procedures to monitor and limit exposure to credit risk on
its trade and non-trade receivables as well as long-term prepayments, there can be no assurance such procedures will effectively limit its credit risk and avoid losses, which could materially adversely affect the companys financial condition
and operating results.the matters relating to the companys past stock option practices and its restatement of
consolidated financial statements may result in additional litigation.the companys investigation into its past
stock option practices and its restatement of prior financial statements in the annual report on form 10-k for the year ended september 30, 2006 gave rise to litigation and government investigations. as described in part i, item 3,
legal proceedings, several derivative and class action complaints regarding stock options were filed against the company and current and former officers and directors. these actions have been dismissed following a comprehensive
settlement. two former officers of the company were also named as defendants in an sec enforcement action, which has been settled.no assurance can be given that additional actions will not be filed against the company and current and former officers and directors as a result of past stock option practices. if such actions are filed and result in adverse findings, the
remedies could materially adversely affect the companys financial condition and operating results.unfavorable
results of legal proceedings could materially adversely affect the company.the company is subject to various legal
proceedings and claims that have arisen out of the ordinary conduct of its business and are not yet resolved and additional claims may arise in the future. results of legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty. regardless of merit,
litigation may be both time-consuming and disruptive to the companys operations and cause significant expense and diversion of management attention. in recognition of these considerations, the company may enter into material settlements.
should the company fail to prevail in certain matters, or should several of these matters be resolved against the company in the same reporting period, the company may be faced with significant monetary damages or injunctive relief against it that
would materially adversely affect a portion of its business and might materially affect the companys financial condition and operating results.the company is subject to risks associated with laws and regulations related to health, safety and environmental protection.the companys products and services, and the production and distribution of those goods and services, are subject to a variety of laws and regulations. these may require the
company to offer customers the ability to return a product at the end of its useful life and place responsibility for environmentally safe disposal or recycling with the company. such laws and regulations have been passed in several jurisdictions in
which the company23


## Item 6

## Item 7


the company is focused on providing innovative products and solutions to consumer, smb,
education, enterprise, government and creative customers that greatly enhance their evolving digital lifestyles and work environments. the companys overall business strategy is to control the design and development of the hardware and software
for all of its products, including the personal computer, mobile communications and consumer electronics devices. the companys business strategy leverages its unique ability to design and develop its own operating system, hardware, application
software, and services to provide its customers new products and solutions with superior ease-of-use, seamless integration, and innovative industrial design. the company believes continual investment in research and development is critical to the
development and enhancement of innovative products and technologies. in conjunction with its strategy, the company continues to build and host a robust platform for the discovery and delivery of third-party digital content and applications through
the itunes store. most recently the company launched the app store that allows users to browse, search for, and purchase third-party applications through either a mac or windows-based computer or by wirelessly downloading directly to an iphone or
ipod touch. the company also desires to support a community for the development of third-party products that complement the companys offerings through its developer programs. the company is therefore uniquely positioned to offer superior and
well-integrated digital lifestyle and productivity solutions.the company participates in several highly competitive markets,
including personal computers with its mac line of personal computers, mobile communications with iphone, consumer electronics with its ipod product families, and distribution of third-party digital content and applications through its online itunes
store. while the company is widely recognized as a leading innovator in the personal computer, mobile communications and consumer electronics markets as well as a leader in the emerging market for distribution of digital content and applications,
these markets are highly competitive and subject to aggressive pricing. to remain competitive, the company believes that increased investment in research and development and marketing and advertising is necessary to maintain or expand its position
in the markets where it competes. the companys research and development spending is focused on further developing its existing mac line of personal computers, its operating system, application software, iphone and ipods; developing new digital
lifestyle consumer and professional software applications; and investing in new product areas and technologies. the company also believes increased investment in marketing and advertising programs is critical to increasing product and brand
awareness.the company utilizes a variety of direct and indirect distribution channels. the company believes that sales of
its innovative and differentiated products are enhanced by knowledgeable salespersons who can convey the value of the hardware, software, and peripheral integration, demonstrate the unique digital lifestyle solutions that are available on mac
computers, and demonstrate the compatibility of the mac with the windows platform and networks. the company further believes providing a high-quality sales and after-sales support experience is critical to attracting new and retaining existing
customers. to ensure a high-quality buying experience for its products in which service and education are emphasized, the company continues to expand and improve its distribution capabilities by opening its own retail stores in the u.s. and in
international markets. the company had 273 stores open as of september 26, 2009.the company has also invested in
programs to enhance reseller sales, including the apple sales consultant program, which places apple employees and contractors at selected third-party reseller locations, and the apple premium reseller program, through which independently run
businesses focus on the apple platform and provide a high level of customer service and product expertise. the company believes providing direct contact with its targeted customers is an efficient way to demonstrate the advantages of its mac
computers and other products over those of its competitors. the company also sells to customers directly through its online stores around the world and through its direct sales force.the company distributes iphone in over 80 countries, through its direct channels, its cellular network carriers distribution channels and certain third-party resellers. the
company has signed multi-year agreements with various cellular network carriers authorizing them to distribute and provide cellular network services for iphones. these agreements are generally not exclusive with a specific carrier, except in the
u.s., germany, spain, ireland and certain other countries.36



the companys ipods are sold through a significant number of distribution points to
provide broad access. ipods can be purchased in certain department stores, member-only warehouse stores, large retail chains and specialty retail stores, as well as through the channels for mac distribution listed above.critical accounting policies and estimatesthe preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles (gaap) and the companys discussion and analysis of its
financial condition and operating results require the companys management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported in its consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. note 1, summary of
significant accounting policies of notes to consolidated financial statements in this form 10-k describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the companys consolidated financial statements.
management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and
liabilities. actual results may differ from these estimates and such differences may be material.management believes the
companys critical accounting policies and estimates are those related to revenue recognition, valuation of marketable securities, allowance for doubtful accounts, inventory valuation and inventory purchase commitments, warranty costs, income
taxes, and legal and other contingencies. management considers these policies critical because they are both important to the portrayal of the companys financial condition and operating results, and they require management to make judgments
and estimates about inherently uncertain matters. the companys senior management has reviewed these critical accounting policies and related disclosures with the audit and finance committee of the companys board of directors.revenue recognitionnet
sales consist primarily of revenue from the sale of hardware, software, third-party digital content and applications, peripherals, and service and support contracts. the company recognizes revenue for software products (operating system software and
applications software), or any product that is considered to be software-related, in accordance with industry specific accounting guidance for software and software related transactions (e.g., mac computers, iphones and ipod portable digital music
and video players). for products that are not software or software-related, (e.g., third-party digital content sold on the itunes store and certain mac, iphone and ipod supplies and accessories), the company recognizes revenue pursuant to various
revenue-related gaap as described below.the company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists,
delivery has occurred, the sales price is fixed or determinable, and collection is probable. product is considered delivered to the customer once it has been shipped and title and risk of loss have been transferred. for most of the companys
product sales, these criteria are met at the time the product is shipped. for online sales to individuals, for some sales to education customers in the u.s., and for certain other sales, the company defers recognition of revenue until the customer
receives the product because the company retains a portion of the risk of loss on these sales during transit. if at the outset of an arrangement the company determines the arrangement fee is not, or is presumed not to be, fixed or determinable,
revenue is deferred and subsequently recognized as amounts become due and payable and all other criteria for revenue recognition have been met.for both iphone and apple tv, the company has indicated it may from time-to-time provide future unspecified features and additional software products free of charge to customers. accordingly, iphone
handsets and apple tv sales are accounted for under subscription accounting in accordance with gaap. as such, the revenue and associated cost of sales are deferred at the time of sale, and are both recognized on a straight-line basis over the
currently estimated 24-month economic lives of these products, with any loss recognized at the time of sale. if the companys estimated economic life of a product accounted for under subscription accounting changes, the37



future rate at which deferred revenue and deferred costs are recognized in the companys results of operations will change. costs incurred by the company for engineering, sales, marketing
and warranty are expensed as incurred.the company records reductions to revenue for estimated commitments related to price
protection and for customer incentive programs, including reseller and end-user rebates, and other sales programs and volume-based incentives. for transactions involving price protection, the company recognizes revenue net of the estimated amount to
be refunded, provided the refund amount can be reasonably and reliably estimated and the other conditions for revenue recognition have been met. the companys policy requires that, if refunds cannot be reliably estimated, revenue is not
recognized until reliable estimates can be made or the price protection lapses. for customer incentive programs, the estimated cost of these programs is recognized at the later of the date at which the company has sold the product or the date at
which the program is offered. the company also records reductions to revenue for expected future product returns based on the companys historical experience. future market conditions and product transitions may require the company to increase
customer incentive programs and incur incremental price protection obligations that could result in additional reductions to revenue at the time such programs are offered. additionally, certain customer incentive programs require management to
estimate the number of customers who will actually redeem the incentive. managements estimates are based on historical experience and the specific terms and conditions of particular incentive programs. if a greater than estimated proportion of
customers redeem such incentives, the company would be required to record additional reductions to revenue, which would have a negative impact on the companys results of operations.valuation and impairment of marketable securitiesthe companys investments in available-for-sale securities are reported at fair value. unrealized gains and losses related to changes in the fair value of investments are included in accumulated
other comprehensive income, net of tax, as reported in the companys consolidated balance sheets. changes in the fair value of investments impact the companys net income only when such investments are sold or an other-than-temporary
impairment is recognized. realized gains and losses on the sale of securities are determined by specific identification of each securitys cost basis. the company regularly reviews its investment portfolio to determine if any investment is
other-than-temporarily impaired due to changes in credit risk or other potential valuation concerns, which would require the company to record an impairment charge in the period any such determination is made. in making this judgment, the company
evaluates, among other things, the duration and extent to which the fair value of an investment is less than its cost, the financial condition of the issuer and any changes thereto, and the companys intent to sell, or whether it is more likely
than not it will be required to sell, the investment before recovery of the investments amortized cost basis. the companys assessment on whether an investment is other-than-temporarily impaired or not, could change in the future due to
new developments or changes in assumptions related to any particular investment.allowance for doubtful accountsthe company distributes its products through third-party distributors, cellular network carriers, and resellers and directly to certain
education, consumer, and enterprise customers. the company generally does not require collateral from its customers; however, the company will require collateral in certain instances to limit credit risk. in addition, when possible the company does
attempt to limit credit risk on trade receivables with credit insurance for certain customers in latin america, europe, asia, and australia, or by requiring third-party financing, loans or leases to support credit exposure. these credit-financing
arrangements are directly between the third-party financing company and the end customer. as such, the company generally does not assume any recourse or credit-risk-sharing related to any of these arrangements. however, considerable trade
receivables that are not covered by collateral, third-party financing arrangements, or credit insurance are outstanding with the companys distribution and retail channel partners.38



the allowance for doubtful accounts is based on managements assessment of the ability
to collect specific customer accounts and includes consideration of the credit-worthiness and financial condition of those specific customers. the company records an allowance to reduce the specific receivables to the amount that it reasonably
believes to be collectible. the company also records an allowance for all other trade receivables based on multiple factors, including historical experience with bad debts, the general economic environment, the financial condition of the
companys distribution channels, and the aging of such receivables. if there is a deterioration of a major customers financial condition, if the company becomes aware of additional information related to the credit-worthiness of a major
customer, or if future actual default rates on trade receivables in general differ from those currently anticipated, the company may have to adjust its allowance for doubtful accounts, which would affect its results of operations in the period the
adjustments are made.inventory valuation and inventory purchase commitmentsthe company must order components for its products and build inventory in advance of product shipments. the company records a write-down for inventories of components and products,
including third-party products held for resale, which have become obsolete or are in excess of anticipated demand or net realizable value. the company performs a detailed review of inventory each fiscal quarter that considers multiple factors
including demand forecasts, product life cycle status, product development plans, current sales levels, and component cost trends. the personal computer, mobile communications and consumer electronics industries are subject to a rapid and
unpredictable pace of product and component obsolescence and demand changes. if future demand or market conditions for the companys products are less favorable than forecasted or if unforeseen technological changes negatively impact the
utility of component inventory, the company may be required to record additional write-downs, which would negatively affect its results of operations in the period when the write-downs were recorded.the company records accruals for estimated cancellation fees related to component orders that have been cancelled or are expected to be
cancelled. consistent with industry practice, the company acquires components through a combination of purchase orders, supplier contracts, and open orders based on projected demand information. these commitments typically cover the companys
requirements for periods ranging from 30 to 150 days. if there is an abrupt and substantial decline in demand for one or more of the companys products or an unanticipated change in technological requirements for any of the companys
products, the company may be required to record additional accruals for cancellation fees that would negatively affect its results of operations in the period when the cancellation fees are identified and recorded.warranty coststhe company
provides for the estimated cost of hardware and software warranties at the time the related revenue is recognized based on historical and projected warranty claim rates, historical and projected cost-per-claim, and knowledge of specific product
failures that are outside of the companys typical experience. each quarter, the company reevaluates its estimates to assess the adequacy of its recorded warranty liabilities considering the size of the installed base of products subject to
warranty protection and adjusts the amounts as necessary. for products accounted for under subscription accounting, the company recognizes warranty expense as incurred. if actual product failure rates or repair costs differ from estimates,
revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required and could materially affect the companys results of operations.the company periodically provides updates to its applications and operating system software to maintain the softwares compliance with specifications. the estimated cost to develop such updates is accounted for as warranty cost that is
recognized at the time related software revenue is recognized. factors considered in determining appropriate accruals related to such updates include the number of units delivered, the number of updates expected to occur, and the historical cost and
estimated future cost of the resources necessary to develop these updates.39



income taxesthe company records a tax provision for the anticipated tax consequences of the reported results of operations. in accordance with gaap, the provision for income taxes is computed using the asset and
liability method, under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, and for operating losses and
tax credit carryforwards. deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in effect for the years in which those tax assets are expected to be realized or settled. the company
records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is believed more likely than not to be realized.the company recognizes and measures uncertain tax positions in accordance with gaap, whereby the company only recognizes the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on
examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood
of being realized upon ultimate settlement.management believes it is more likely than not that forecasted income, including
income that may be generated as a result of certain tax planning strategies, together with the tax effects of the deferred tax liabilities, will be sufficient to fully recover the remaining deferred tax assets. in the event that the company
determines all or part of the net deferred tax assets are not realizable in the future, the company will make an adjustment to the valuation allowance that would be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made. in addition, the
calculation of tax liabilities involves significant judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of gaap and complex tax laws. resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with managements expectations
could have a material impact on the companys financial condition and operating results.legal and other contingenciesas discussed in part i, item 3 of this form 10-k under the heading legal proceedings and in note 8,
commitments and contingencies in notes to consolidated financial statements, the company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business. in accordance with gaap, the company records a
liability when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable. there is significant judgment required in both the probability determination and as to whether an exposure can be reasonably estimated. in
managements opinion, the company does not have a potential liability related to any current legal proceedings and claims that would individually or in the aggregate materially adversely affect its financial condition or operating results.
however, the outcomes of legal proceedings and claims brought against the company are subject to significant uncertainty. should the company fail to prevail in any of these legal matters or should several of these legal matters be resolved against
the company in the same reporting period, the operating results of a particular reporting period could be materially adversely affected.net salesfiscal years 2009, 2008 and 2007 spanned 52 weeks. an additional week is included in the first
fiscal quarter approximately every six years to realign fiscal quarters with calendar quarters.40

the following:iphone revenue and net sales of related products and services amounted to $6.8 billion in 2009, an increase of $4.9 billion or 266% compared to
2008. iphone handset unit sales totaled 20.7 million during 2009, which represents an increase of 9.1 million or 78% during 2009 compared to 2008. this growth is attributed primarily to expanded distribution and strong overall demand for
iphones. iphone 3gs was released in the u.s. on june 19, 2009 and in many other countries over the remainder of 2009. iphone revenue includes the portion of handset revenue recognized in the relevant period in accordance with subscription
accounting over the products currently estimated 24-month economic life, as well as revenue from sales of iphone accessories and carrier agreements. the year-over-year iphone revenue growth is also largely attributable to the year-over-year
increase in iphone handset unit sales in both 2009 and 2008, which generated significant amounts of deferred revenue that is being recognized over the iphones estimated economic life.net sales of other music-related products and services increased $696 million or 21% during 2009 compared to 2008. the increase was due
predominantly to increased net sales of third-party digital content and applications from the itunes store, which experienced double-digit growth in each of the companys geographic segments during 2009 compared to the same period in 2008. the
company believes this continued growth is the result of heightened consumer interest in downloading third-party digital content and applications, continued growth in its customer base of ipod and iphone customers, the expansion of third-party audio
and video content available for sale and rent via the itunes store, and the continued interest in and growth of the app store. the company continues to expand its itunes content and applications offerings around the world.partially offsetting the favorable factors discussed above, net sales during 2009 were negatively impacted
by certain factors, including the following:mac net sales declined 3% during 2009 compared to 2008, although mac unit sales increased by 7% over the same period. net sales per mac unit sold
decreased by 10% during 2009 compared to 2008, due primarily to lower average selling prices across all mac portable and desktop systems and a stronger u.s. dollar. net sales of macs accounted for 38% of the companys total net sales for 2009.
during 2009, mac portable systems net sales and unit sales increased by 9% and 20%, respectively, compared to 2008. this growth was driven by strong demand for macbook pro, which was updated in june 2009 and october 2008, and experienced double
digit net sales and unit growth in each of the companys reportable operating segments compared to the same period in 2008. the company also had a higher product mix of portable systems, which is consistent with the overall market trends.
however, net sales and unit sales of the companys mac desktop systems decreased by 23% and 14%, respectively, during 2009 compared to 2008. the decrease in net sales of mac desktop systems was due mainly to a shift in product mix towards
lower-priced desktops, lower average selling prices across all mac desktop systems and a stronger u.s. dollar.net sales of ipods decreased $1.1 billion or 12% during 2009 compared to 2008. ipod unit sales decreased slightly by 1% during 2009 compared to
2008. net sales per ipod unit sold decreased 11% to $149 in 2009 compared to 2008, resulting from lower average selling prices across all of the ipod product lines, which were due primarily to price reductions taken with the introduction of new
ipods in42



september 2009 and september 2008 and a stronger u.s. dollar, offset partially by a higher product mix of ipod touch.fiscal year 2008 versus 2007net sales during 2008 increased 35% or $8.5 billion from 2007. several factors contributed to these increases including the following:mac net sales increased $4.0 billion or 38% during 2008 compared to 2007, while mac unit sales increased by 2.7 million units or 38%. net sales
related to the companys mac shipments accounted for 44% of the companys total net revenue. higher mac unit sales, which contributed to the increases in net sales, were driven by higher sales of all of the companys mac portable
products as well as the popularity of the imac, which experienced strong growth in net sales and unit sales in all of the companys reportable segments. unit sales of the companys mac portable products accounted for 62% of the
companys personal computer shipments in both 2008 and 2007. net sales and unit sales of the companys mac portable products both increased by 38% during 2008 compared to 2007. this growth was attributable to strong demand for all the mac
portable products, particularly the macbook, which had double-digit growth in all of the companys operating segments, and the addition of the macbook air, which was introduced to the companys mac portable product line in january 2008.
growth of the companys mac desktop systems was also strong, with increased net sales and unit sales of 39% and 37%, respectively, during 2008 due primarily to strong sales of the imac in all of the companys operating segments.net sales of ipods increased $848 million or 10% during 2008 compared to 2007 whereas unit sales of ipods increased 6% compared to 2007. the ipod
unit growth was due to strong demand for the ipod touch, and to a lesser extent, higher unit sales of the ipod shuffle due to a price reduction in february 2008. ipod net sales grew faster than ipod unit sales due to higher average selling prices
caused by a shift in overall ipod product mix to the higher priced ipod touch.net sales of iphone and related products and services were $1.8 billion for 2008, with iphone handset unit sales totaling 11.6 million. net sales of
iphone and related products and services were $123 million in 2007, which represented sales for one fiscal quarter. iphone revenue includes the portion of handset revenue recognized in the relevant period in accordance with subscription accounting
over the products currently estimated 24-month economic life, as well as revenue from sales of iphone accessories and from carrier agreements.net sales of other music related products and services increased $844 million or 34% during 2008 compared to 2007, due primarily to significantly
increased net sales from the itunes store in each of the companys geographic segments. the company believes this success is the result of heightened consumer interest in downloading third-party digital content, the expansion of third-party
audio and video content available for sale and rent via the itunes store, and the launch of the itunes app store. the company continues to expand its itunes content offerings around the world.segment operating performancethe company manages its business primarily on a geographic basis. the companys reportable operating segments consist of the americas, europe, japan and retail. the americas, europe and japan reportable segments do not include
activities related to the retail segment. the americas segment includes both north and south america. the europe segment includes european countries as well as the middle east and africa. the retail segment operates apple-owned retail stores in the
u.s. and in international markets. each reportable geographic operating segment and the retail operating segment provide similar hardware and software products and similar services. further information regarding the companys operating segments
may be found in note 9, segment information and geographic data in notes to consolidated financial statements of this form 10-k.43



americasduring 2009, net sales in the americas segment increased $1.6 billion or 11% compared to 2008. the increase in net sales during 2009 was attributable to the significant year-over-year increase in iphone
revenue, higher sales of third-party digital content and applications from the itunes store, and increased sales of mac portable systems, which were partially offset by a decrease in sales of mac desktop systems and ipods. americas mac net sales
decreased 6% due primarily to lower average selling prices, while mac unit sales increased by 4% on a year-over-year basis. the increase in mac unit sales was due primarily to strong demand for the macbook pro, which was updated in june 2009 and
october 2008. the americas segment represented approximately 44% and 45% of the companys total net sales in 2009 and 2008, respectively.during 2008, net sales in the americas segment increased $3.0 billion or 26% compared to 2007. the primary drivers of this growth were the significant year-over-year increase in sales of the ipod touch,
mac portable systems, content from the itunes store, and iphone. the company began shipping iphone in june 2007 and the growth in iphone sales in 2008 resulted from a full year of iphone shipments as well as stronger demand for iphones in the fourth
quarter of 2008. the increase in mac net sales of $1.3 billion or 30% and mac unit sales of 961 million or 32% is attributable to growth in sales of all of the mac portable systems, particularly the macbook, and higher sales of the imac. net
sales of ipods increased due to a shift in product mix toward higher priced ipods, particularly the ipod touch, which was upgraded in june 2008. in 2008, the americas segment represented 45% of the companys total net sales as compared to 48%
in the same period of 2007.europeduring 2009, net sales in europe increased $1.7 billion or 23% compared to 2008. the increase in net sales was due mainly to increased iphone revenue and mac portable systems, offset partially by lower
net sales of mac desktop systems, ipods, and a stronger u.s. dollar. mac unit sales increased 13% in 2009 compared to 2008, which was driven primarily by increased sales of mac portable systems, particularly macbook pro, while total mac net sales
declined as a result of lower average selling prices across all mac products. although ipod net sales decreased in europe year-over-year as a result of lower average selling prices, ipod unit sales increased due to ipod touch and market share
increases. the europe segment represented 26% and 23% of total net sales in 2009 and 2008, respectively.europes net
sales and mac unit sales increased 40% and 39%, respectively, during 2008 compared to 2007. the main drivers of this growth were strong sales of mac portable systems and imac, increased sales from the itunes store, and iphone. also contributing to
the increase in net sales were higher ipod net sales due primarily to the ipod touch, which was upgraded in june 2008. sales of mac portable products increased due to stronger demand for the macbook pro and the macbook, both updated in february
2008, as well as sales of the macbook air, introduced in january 2008. mac desktop sales also increased due primarily to the popularity of the imac, which was updated in april 2008. the europe segment represented 23% of total net sales in 2008,
consistent with 2007.japanjapans net sales increased $322 million or 21% in 2009 compared to 2008. the key contributors to this growth were increased iphone revenue, stronger demand for certain mac portable systems and
ipods, and strength in the japanese yen, partially offset by decreased sales of mac desktop systems. net sales and unit sales of mac portable systems increased during 2009 compared to 2008, driven primarily by stronger demand for macbook pro, which
was updated in june 2009 and october 2008. net sales and unit sales of ipods increased during 2009 compared to 2008, driven by strong demand for ipod touch and ipod nano.japan net sales increased $427 million or 39% in 2008 compared to 2007. the primary contributors to the growth in net sales were increases in sales of ipods, imac, mac portable systems, and strong sales
from the itunes store. net sales, unit sales and the average selling price of ipods increased during 2008 compared to 2007, driven by44



strong demand for ipod touch and ipod nano. additionally, mac net sales and unit sales grew 42% and 29%, respectively, in 2008 compared to 2007 due to increases in sales of imac and mac portable
systems, particularly macbook, as well as the introduction of macbook air in january 2008.retailretail net sales increased $259 million or 4% during 2009 compared to 2008. the growth in net sales was driven largely by increased iphone
revenue and mac portable systems, offset partially by a decrease in sales of ipods and mac desktop systems. the company opened 26 new retail stores during 2009, including a total of 14 international stores, ending the year with 273 stores open. this
compares to 247 stores open as of september 27, 2008 and 197 open stores as of september 29, 2007.the
year-over-year growth rate of retail net sales was less than the increase in the average number of stores open during the same period, which the company believes reflects the challenging consumer-spending environment and continued third-party
channel expansion, particularly in the u.s. where most of its stores are located. with an average of 254 stores and 211 stores opened during 2009 and 2008, respectively, average revenue per store decreased to $25.9 million for 2009 from $29.9
million in 2008.the retail segments net sales grew by 53% during 2008 compared to 2007, due in large part to increased
sales of mac portable and desktop systems, strong demand for the iphone and ipod touch, and new store openings. the company opened 50 new retail stores during 2008, bringing the total number of open stores to 247 as of september 27, 2008. this
compares to 197 open stores as of september 29, 2007. with an average of 211 stores and 178 stores opened during 2008 and 2007, respectively, average revenue per store increased to $29.9 million for 2008 from $23.1 million in 2007.as measured by the companys operating segment reporting, the retail segment reported operating income of $1.4 billion during 2009,
as compared to operating income of $1.3 billion and $875 million during 2008 and 2007, respectively. this increase in operating income in 2009 was driven by increased total retail net sales attributable to a 20% increase in average stores open and
higher gross margin percentage consistent with that experienced company-wide. the retail segments operating income increased by $462 million during 2008 as compared to 2007 due primarily to the significant retail net sales growth of 53% as
compared to 2007.expansion of the retail segment has required and will continue to require a substantial investment in fixed
assets and related infrastructure, operating lease commitments, personnel, and other operating expenses. capital asset purchases associated with the retail segment were $369 million in 2009, bringing the total capital asset purchases since inception
of the retail segment to $1.8 billion. as of september 26, 2009, the retail segment had approximately 16,500 full-time equivalent employees and had outstanding operating lease commitments associated with retail store space and related
facilities of $1.5 billion. the company would incur substantial costs if it were to close multiple retail stores. such costs could adversely affect the companys financial condition and operating results.other segmentsthe
companys other segments, which consist of its asia pacific and filemaker operations, experienced an increase in net sales of $165 million, or 7%, during 2009 as compared to 2008 reflecting strong growth in sales of iphone and mac portable
systems offset partially by a decline in sales related to ipods and mac desktop systems in the asia pacific region, as well as a strengthening of the u.s. dollar against the australian dollar and other asian currencies. mac net sales and unit sales
grew in the asia pacific region by 4% and 17%, respectively, due to increased sales of the macbook pro.the companys
other segments experienced an increase in net sales of $707 million, or 40% during 2008 as compared to 2007. these increases are related primarily to strong growth in sales of all mac portable systems,45

ipods, the imac, and content from the itunes store in the companys asia pacific region. sales from the itunes store in the companys asia pacific region grew 109% compared to 2007.gross margingross margin for the three years ended september 26, 2009, are as follows (in millions, except gross margin percentages):net salescost of salesgross margingross margin percentagethe gross margin percentage in 2009 was 36.0% compared to 34.3% in 2008. the primary
drivers of the increase in 2009 as compared to 2008 were significantly lower commodity and other product costs and a favorable sales mix toward products with higher gross margins, which were partially offset by product price reductions. gross margin
percentage was relatively flat in 2008 as compared to 2007.the company expects its gross margin percentage to decrease in
future periods compared to levels achieved during 2009 and anticipates gross margin levels of about 34% in the first quarter of 2010. this expected decline is due largely to the anticipated impact of product transitions, flat or reduced pricing on
new and innovative products that have higher cost structures, and both expected and potential future cost increases for key components.the foregoing statements regarding the companys expected gross margin percentage are forward-looking and could differ from anticipated levels because of several factors, including but not limited to
certain of those set forth below in part i, item 1a, risk factors under the subheading future operating results depend upon the companys ability to obtain key components including but not limited to microprocessors,
nand flash memory, dram and lcds at favorable prices and in sufficient quantities, which is incorporated herein by reference. there can be no assurance that targeted gross margin percentage levels will be achieved. in general, gross
margins and margins on individual products will remain under downward pressure due to a variety of factors, including continued industry wide global product pricing pressures, increased competition, compressed product life cycles, product
transitions and expected increases in the cost of key components including but not limited to microprocessors, nand flash memory, dynamic random access memory (dram) and liquid crystal displays (lcds), as well as potential
increases in the costs of outside manufacturing services and a potential shift in the companys sales mix towards products with lower gross margins. in response to these competitive pressures, the company expects it will continue to take
product pricing actions, which would adversely affect gross margins. gross margins could also be affected by the companys ability to manage product quality and warranty costs effectively and to stimulate demand for certain of its products. due
to the companys significant international operations, financial results can be significantly affected in the short-term by fluctuations in exchange rates.operating expensesoperating expenses for the three years ended

research and development (r&d)r&d expenditures increased 20% or $224 million to $1.3 billion in 2009 compared to 2008. these increases were due primarily to an
increase in headcount and higher stock-based compensation expenses in the current year to support expanded r&d activities. in addition, $71 million of software development costs were capitalized related to mac os x snow leopard and excluded from
r&d expense during 2009, compared to $11 million of software development costs capitalized during 2008. although total r&d expense increased 20% during 2009, it remained relatively flat as a percentage of net sales given the 12% increase in
revenue in 2009. the company continues to believe that focused investments in r&d are critical to its future growth and competitive position in the marketplace and are directly related to timely development of new and enhanced products that are
central to the companys core business strategy. as such, the company expects to make further investments in r&d to remain competitive.expenditures for r&d increased 42% or $327 million to $1.1 billion in 2008 compared to 2007. these increases were due primarily to an increase in headcount in 2008 and higher stock-based compensation
expenses. in 2008, $11 million of software development costs were capitalized related to mac os x snow leopard and excluded from r&d expense, while r&d expense for 2007 excluded $75 million of capitalized software development costs related
to mac os x leopard and iphone software. although total r&d expense increased 42% during 2008, it remained relatively flat as a percentage of net sales given the 35% increase in revenue during 2008.selling, general and administrative expense (sg&a)sg&a expenditures increased $388 million or 10% to $4.1 billion in 2009 compared to 2008. these increases are due primarily to the companys continued expansion of its retail segment in both
domestic and international markets, higher stock-based compensation expenses and higher spending on marketing and advertising.expenditures for sg&a increased $798 million or 27% to $3.8 billion in 2008 compared to 2007. these increases are due primarily to higher stock-based compensation expenses, higher variable selling expenses resulting from the significant
year-over-year increase in total net sales and the companys continued expansion of its retail segment in both domestic and international markets. in addition, the company incurred higher spending on marketing and advertising during 2008
compared to 2007.other income and expenseother income and expense for the three years ended september 26, 2009, are as follows (in millions):interest incomeother income (expense), nettotal other income and expensetotal other income and expense decreased $294 million or 47% to $326 million during
2009 compared to $620 million and $599 million in 2008 and 2007, respectively. the overall decrease in other income and expense is attributable to the significant decline in interest rates during 2009 compared to 2008 and 2007, partially offset by
the companys higher cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balances. the weighted average interest rate earned by the company on its cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities was 1.43%, 3.44% and 5.27% during 2009, 2008 and
2007, respectively. during 2009, 2008 and 2007, the company had no debt outstanding and accordingly did not incur any related interest expense.the companys investment portfolio had gross unrealized losses of $16 million and $121 million as of september 26, 2009 and september 27, 2008, respectively, which were offset by gross
unrealized gains of $73 million and $4 million as of september 26, 2009 and september 27, 2008, respectively. the net unrealized gains47



as of september 26, 2009 and the net unrealized losses as of september 27, 2008 related primarily to long-term marketable securities. the company considers the declines in market value
of its marketable securities investment portfolio to be temporary in nature. the unrealized losses on the companys marketable securities were caused primarily by changes in market interest rates, specifically widening credit spreads. the
company does not have the intent to sell, nor is it more likely than not the company will be required to sell, any investment before recovery of its amortized cost basis. accordingly, no material declines in fair value were recognized in the
companys consolidated statements of operations during 2009, 2008 and 2007. the company may sell certain of its marketable securities prior to their stated maturities for strategic purposes, in anticipation of credit deterioration, or for
duration management. the company recognized no material net gains or losses during 2009, 2008 and 2007 related to such sales.provision
for income taxesthe companys effective tax rates were 29%, 30% and 30% for 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. the
companys effective rates for these periods differ from the statutory federal income tax rate of 35% due primarily to certain undistributed foreign earnings for which no u.s. taxes are provided because such earnings are intended to be
indefinitely reinvested outside the u.s.as of september 26, 2009, the company had deferred tax assets arising from
deductible temporary differences, tax losses, and tax credits of $3.2 billion before being offset against certain deferred liabilities of $1.8 billion for presentation on the companys consolidated balance sheet. management believes it is more
likely than not that forecasted income, including income that may be generated as a result of certain tax planning strategies, together with the tax effects of the deferred tax liabilities, will be sufficient to fully recover the remaining deferred
tax assets. the company will continue to evaluate the realizability of deferred tax assets quarterly by assessing the need for and amount of the valuation allowance.the internal revenue service (the irs) has completed its field audit of the companys federal income tax returns for the years 2002 through 2003 and proposed certain adjustments. the
company has contested certain of these adjustments through the irs appeals office. all irs audit issues for years prior to 2002 have been resolved. in addition, the company is subject to audits by state, local, and foreign tax
authorities. management believes that adequate provision has been made for any adjustments that may result from tax examinations. however, the outcome of tax audits cannot be predicted with certainty. if any issues addressed in the
companys tax audits are resolved in a manner not consistent with managements expectations, the company could be required to adjust its provision for income taxes in the period such resolution occurs.recent accounting pronouncementsin september 2009, the financial accounting standards boards (fasb) amended the accounting standards codification (asc) as summarized in accounting standards update (asu) 2009-14, software (topic 985):
certain revenue arrangements that include software elements, and asu 2009-13, revenue recognition (topic 605): multiple-deliverable revenue arrangements. as summarized in asu 2009-14, asc topic 985 has been amended to remove from the
scope of industry specific revenue accounting guidance for software and software related transactions, tangible products containing software components and non-software components that function together to deliver the products essential
functionality. as summarized in asu 2009-13, asc topic 605 has been amended (1) to provide updated guidance on whether multiple deliverables exist, how the deliverables in an arrangement should be separated, and the consideration allocated;
(2) to require an entity to allocate revenue in an arrangement using estimated selling prices of deliverables if a vendor does not have vendor-specific objective evidence (vsoe) or third-party evidence of selling price; and
(3) to eliminate the use of the residual method and require an entity to allocate revenue using the relative selling price method. the accounting changes summarized in asu 2009-14 and asu 2009-13 are both effective for fiscal years beginning on
or after june 15, 2010, with early adoption permitted. adoption may either be on a prospective basis or by retrospective application.48

the company is currently assessing the impact of these amendments to the asc on its
accounting and reporting systems and processes; however, at this time the company is unable to quantify the impact on its financial statements of its adoption or determine the timing and method of its adoption. as of september 26, 2009, total
iphone and apple tv deferred revenue and deferred costs were $12.1 billion and $5.2 billion, respectively. the company believes that application of these amendments will result in a substantial portion of the revenue associated with the sale of
iphone and apple tv and all related cost of sales being recognized at the time of sale. currently revenue and associated cost of sales for these products are deferred at the time of sale and recognized ratably on a straight-line basis over the
currently estimated 24-month economic life of the products.during the first quarter of 2009, the company adopted fasb asc
820, fair value measurements and disclosures (formerly referenced as statement of financial accounting standards (sfas) no. 157, fair value measurements), which defines fair value, provides a framework for
measuring fair value, and expands the disclosures required for fair value measurements. in february 2008, the fasb issued supplemental guidance that delays the effective date of this new fair value accounting standard to fiscal years beginning after
november 15, 2008 for all non-financial assets and non-financial liabilities, except for items that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis (at least annually) and will be adopted by the
company beginning in the first quarter of 2010. although the company will continue to evaluate the application of this accounting standard, management does not currently believe adoption of this accounting pronouncement will have a material impact
on the companys financial condition or operating results.in december 2007, the fasb issued fasb asc 805, business
combinations (formerly referenced as sfas no. 141 (revised 2007), business combinations), which establishes principles and requirements for how an acquirer recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets
acquired, the liabilities assumed, and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree in a business combination. this new accounting standard also establishes principles regarding how goodwill acquired in a business combination or a gain from a bargain
purchase should be recognized and measured, as well as provides guidelines on the disclosure requirements on the nature and financial impact of the business combination. in april 2009, the fasb amended this new accounting standard to require that
assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination that arise from contingencies be recognized at fair value, if the fair value can be determined during the measurement period. this new business combination accounting standard is
effective for fiscal years beginning on or after december 15, 2008 and will be adopted by the company beginning in the first quarter of 2010 and will apply prospectively to any business combinations completed on or after that date. the effect
of adoption of this new accounting pronouncement on the companys financial condition or operating results will depend on the nature of acquisitions completed after the date of adoption.liquidity and capital resourcesthe following table presents selected financial information and statistics as of and for the three years ended september 26, 2009 (in millions):cash, cash equivalents and marketable securitiesaccounts receivable, netinventoriesworking capitalannual operating cash flowas of september 26, 2009, the company had $34.0 billion in cash, cash
equivalents and marketable securities, an increase of $9.5 billion from september 27, 2008. the principal component of this net increase was the cash generated by operating activities of $10.2 billion, which was partially offset by payments for
acquisitions of property, plant and equipment of $1.1 billion. the companys cash generated by operating activities significantly exceeded its net income due primarily to the increase in deferred revenue, net of deferred costs, associated with

the companys marketable securities investment portfolio is invested primarily in
highly rated securities, generally with a minimum rating of single-a or equivalent. as of september 26, 2009 and september 27, 2008, $17.4 billion and $11.3 billion, respectively, of the companys cash, cash equivalents and marketable
securities were held by foreign subsidiaries and are generally based in u.s. dollar-denominated holdings. the company believes its existing balances of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities will be sufficient to satisfy its working
capital needs, capital asset purchases, outstanding commitments and other liquidity requirements associated with its existing operations over the next 12 months.capital assetsthe companys cash payments for capital asset
purchases were $1.1 billion during 2009, consisting of $369 million for retail store facilities and $775 million for real estate acquisitions and corporate infrastructure including information systems enhancements. the company anticipates utilizing
approximately $1.9 billion for capital asset purchases during 2010, including approximately $400 million for retail facilities and approximately $1.5 billion for corporate facilities, infrastructure, and product tooling and manufacturing process
equipment.historically the company has opened between 25 and 50 new retail stores per year. during 2010, the company expects
to open a number of new stores near the upper end of this range, over half of which are expected to be located outside of the u.s.off-balance sheet arrangements and contractual obligationsthe company has not entered into any transactions
with unconsolidated entities whereby the company has financial guarantees, subordinated retained interests, derivative instruments, or other contingent arrangements that expose the company to material continuing risks, contingent liabilities, or any
other obligation under a variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing, liquidity, market risk, or credit risk support to the company.the following table presents certain payments due by the company under contractual obligations with minimum firm commitments as of september 26, 2009 and excludes amounts already recorded on the
consolidated balance sheet as current liabilities (in millions):operating leasespurchase obligationsasset retirement obligationsother obligationstotallease commitmentsas of september 26, 2009, the company had total outstanding commitments on noncancelable operating leases of $1.9 billion, $1.5 billion of which related to the lease of retail
space and related facilities. the companys major facility leases are generally for terms of one to 20 years and generally provide renewal options for terms of one to five additional years. leases for retail space are for terms of five to 20
years, the majority of which are for ten years, and often contain multi-year renewal options.purchase commitments with contract
manufacturers and component suppliersthe company utilizes several contract manufacturers to manufacture sub-assemblies
for the companys products and to perform final assembly and test of finished products. these contract manufacturers acquire components50



and build product based on demand information supplied by the company, which typically covers periods ranging from 30 to 150 days. the company also obtains individual components for its products
from a wide variety of individual suppliers. consistent with industry practice, the company acquires components through a combination of purchase orders, supplier contracts, and open orders based on projected demand information. such purchase
commitments typically cover the companys forecasted component and manufacturing requirements for periods ranging from 30 to 150 days. in addition, the company has an off-balance sheet warranty obligation for products accounted for under
subscription accounting whereby the company recognizes warranty expense as incurred. as of september 26, 2009, the company had outstanding off-balance sheet third-party manufacturing commitments, component purchase commitments and estimated
warranty commitments of $4.8 billion.the company has entered into prepaid long-term supply agreements to secure the supply
of certain inventory components. during the first quarter of 2009, a long-term supply agreement with intel corporation was terminated and the remaining prepaid balance of $167 million was repaid to the company. during the second and fourth quarters
of 2009, the company made a prepayment of $500 million to lg display for the purchase of lcd panels and a prepayment of $500 million to toshiba to purchase nand flash memory, respectively. as of september 26, 2009, the company had a total
of $1.2 billion of inventory component prepayments outstanding.asset retirement obligationsthe companys asset retirement obligations are associated with commitments to return property subject to operating leases to original
condition upon lease termination. as of september 26, 2009, the company estimated that gross expected future cash flows of $32 million would be required to fulfill these obligations.other obligationsother
outstanding obligations were $356 million as of september 26, 2009, which related to advertising, research and development, internet and telecommunications services and other obligations.as of september 26, 2009, the company had gross unrecognized tax benefits of $971 million and an additional $291 million for gross interest and penalties classified as
non-current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet. the company believes it is reasonably possible that tax audit resolutions could reduce its unrecognized tax benefits by between $105 million and $145 million in the next 12 months. at
this time, the company is unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments in individual years due to uncertainties in the timing of tax audit outcomes; therefore, such amounts are not included in the above contractual
obligation table.indemnificationsthe company generally does not indemnify end-users of its operating system and application software against legal claims that the software infringes third-party intellectual property rights. other
agreements entered into by the company sometimes include indemnification provisions under which the company could be subject to costs and/or damages in the event of an infringement claim against the company or an indemnified third-party. however,
the company has not been required to make any significant payments resulting from such an infringement claim asserted against it or an indemnified third-party and, in the opinion of management, does not have a liability related to unresolved
infringement claims subject to indemnification that would materially adversely affect its financial condition or operating results. therefore, the company did not record a liability for infringement costs as of either september 26, 2009 or
september 27, 2008.the company has entered into indemnification agreements with its directors and executive officers.
under these agreements, the company has agreed to indemnify such individuals to the fullest extent permitted by law against liabilities that arise by reason of their status as directors or officers and to advance expenses incurred by such51


## Item 7A


foreign currency riskin general, the company is a net receiver of currencies other than the u.s. dollar. accordingly, changes in exchange rates, and in particular a strengthening of the u.s. dollar, will negatively affect the
companys net sales and gross margins as expressed in u.s. dollars. there is also a risk that the company will have to adjust local currency product pricing due to competitive pressures when there has been significant volatility in foreign
currency exchange rates.the company may enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts with financial institutions
to protect against foreign exchange risks associated with certain existing assets and liabilities, certain firmly committed transactions, forecasted future cash flows, and net investments in foreign subsidiaries. generally, the companys
practice is to hedge a majority of its material foreign exchange exposures, typically for three to six months. however, the company may choose not to hedge certain foreign exchange exposures for a variety of reasons, including but not limited to
immateriality, accounting considerations and the prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures.to provide a
meaningful assessment of the foreign currency risk associated with certain of the companys foreign currency derivative positions, the company performed a sensitivity analysis using a value-at-risk (var) model to assess the
potential impact of fluctuations in exchange rates. the var model consisted of using a monte carlo simulation to generate 3,000 random market price paths. the var is the maximum expected loss in fair value, for a given confidence interval, to the
companys foreign exchange portfolio due to adverse movements in rates. the var model is not intended to represent actual losses but is used as a risk estimation and management tool. the model assumes normal market conditions. forecasted
transactions, firm commitments, and assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies were excluded from the model. based on the results of the model, the company estimates with 95% confidence a maximum one-day loss in fair value of $44
million as of september 26, 2009 compared to a maximum one-day loss in fair value of $60 million as of september 27, 2008. because the company uses foreign currency instruments for hedging purposes, losses incurred on those instruments are
generally offset by increases in the fair value of the underlying exposures.actual future gains and losses associated with
the companys investment portfolio and derivative positions may differ materially from the sensitivity analyses performed as of september 26, 2009 due to the inherent limitations associated with predicting the changes in the timing and
amount of interest rates, foreign currency exchanges rates and the companys actual exposures and positions.53

notes to consolidated financial statementsnote 1  summary of significant accounting policiesapple inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries (collectively apple or the company) design, manufacture, and market personal computers, mobile communication devices, and portable
digital music and video players and sell a variety of related software, third-party digital content and applications, services, peripherals, and networking solutions. the company sells its products worldwide through its online stores, its retail
stores, its direct sales force, and third-party wholesalers, resellers and value-added resellers. in addition, the company sells a variety of third-party macintosh (mac), iphone and ipod compatible products including application
software, printers, storage devices, speakers, headphones, and various other accessories and supplies through its online and retail stores. the company sells to consumer, small and mid-sized business (smb), education, enterprise,
government and creative customers.basis of presentation and preparationthe accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the company. intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. the preparation of these
consolidated financial statements in conformity with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles (gaap) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in these consolidated financial statements
and accompanying notes. actual results could differ materially from those estimates.certain prior year amounts in the
consolidated financial statements and notes thereto have been reclassified to conform to the current years presentation. during the first quarter of 2009, the company reclassified $2.4 billion of certain fixed-income securities from
short-term marketable securities to long-term marketable securities in the september 27, 2008 consolidated balance sheet. the reclassification resulted from a change in accounting presentation for certain investments based on contractual
maturity dates, which more closely reflects the companys assessment of the timing of when such securities will be converted to cash. as a result of this change, marketable securities with maturities less than 12 months are classified as
short-term and marketable securities with maturities greater than 12 months are classified as long-term. there have been no changes in the companys investment policies or practices associated with this change in accounting presentation. see
note 2, financial instruments of this form 10-k for additional information.the companys fiscal year is the
52 or 53-week period that ends on the last saturday of september. the companys fiscal years 2009, 2008 and 2007 ended on september 26, 2009, september 27, 2008 and september 29, 2007, respectively, and included 52 weeks
each. an additional week is included in the first fiscal quarter approximately every six years to realign fiscal quarters with calendar quarters. unless otherwise stated, references to particular years or quarters refer to the companys fiscal
years ended in september and the associated quarters of those fiscal years.in may 2009, the financial accounting standards
board (fasb) established general accounting standards and disclosure for subsequent events. the company adopted fasb accounting standards codification (asc) 855, subsequent events (formerly referenced as
statement of financial accounting standards (sfas) no. 165, subsequent events), during the third quarter of 2009. the company has evaluated subsequent events through the date and time the financial statements were issued on
october 27, 2009.financial instrumentscash equivalents and marketable securitiesall highly liquid investments
with maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase are classified as cash equivalents. the companys debt and marketable equity securities have been classified and accounted for as available-for-sale. management determines the
appropriate classification of its investments in debt securities at59



the time of purchase and reevaluates the available-for-sale designations as of each balance sheet date. the company classifies its marketable debt securities as either short-term or long-term
based on each instruments underlying contractual maturity date. marketable securities with maturities of less than 12 months are classified as short-term and marketable securities with maturities greater than 12 months are classified as
long-term. these securities are carried at fair value, with the unrealized gains and losses, net of taxes, reported as a component of shareholders equity. the cost of securities sold is based upon the specific identification method.derivative financial instrumentsduring the second quarter of 2009, the company adopted fasb asc 815, derivatives and hedging (formerly referenced as sfas no. 161, disclosures about derivative instruments and hedging
activities  an amendment of fasb statement no. 133), which requires additional disclosures about the companys objectives and strategies for using derivative instruments, how the derivative instruments and related hedged items
are accounted for, and how the derivative instruments and related hedged item affect the financial statements.the company
accounts for its derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities and carries them at fair value. derivatives that are not defined as hedges must be adjusted to fair value through earnings.for derivative instruments that hedge the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows that are designated as cash flow hedges, the
effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative instrument is reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income in shareholders equity and reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged
transaction affects earnings. the ineffective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative instrument is recognized in current earnings. to receive hedge accounting treatment, cash flow hedges must be highly effective in offsetting changes to
expected future cash flows on hedged transactions. for options designated as cash flow hedges, changes in the time value are excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and are recognized in earnings. for derivative instruments that hedge
the exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset or a liability and that are designated as fair value hedges, the net gain or loss on the derivative instrument as well as the offsetting gain or loss on the hedged item attributable to the hedged
risk are recognized in earnings in the current period. the company did not have a net gain or loss on these derivative instruments during 2009, 2008 and 2007. the net gain or loss on the effective portion of a derivative instrument that is
designated as an economic hedge of the foreign currency translation exposure of the net investment in a foreign operation is reported in the same manner as a foreign currency translation adjustment. for forward exchange contracts designated as net
investment hedges, the company excludes changes in fair value relating to changes in the forward carry component from its definition of effectiveness. accordingly, any gains or losses related to this component are recognized in current earnings.fair value measurementsduring the first quarter of 2009, the company adopted fasb asc 820, fair value measurements and disclosures (formerly referenced as sfas no. 157, fair value measurements), which
defines fair value, establishes guidelines for measuring fair value and expands disclosures regarding fair value measurements. this new accounting standard does not require any new fair value measurements. the company applies fair value accounting
for all financial assets and liabilities and non-financial assets and liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis. the company defines fair value as the price that would be received
from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. when determining the fair value measurements for assets and liabilities, which are required to be recorded at fair
value, the company considers the principal or most advantageous market in which the company would transact and the market-based risk measurements or assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, such as inherent
risk, transfer restrictions and credit risk.during the first quarter of 2009, the company adopted fasb asc
825, financial instruments (formerly referenced as sfas no. 159, the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities  including60



an amendment of fasb statement no. 115), which allows companies to choose to measure eligible financial instruments and certain other items at fair value that are not required
to be measured at fair value. the company has not elected the fair value option for any eligible financial instruments.inventoriesinventories are stated at the lower of cost, computed using the first-in, first-out method, or market. if the cost of the
inventories exceeds their market value, provisions are made currently for the difference between the cost and the market value. the companys inventories consist primarily of finished goods for all periods presented.property, plant and equipmentproperty, plant and equipment are stated at cost. depreciation is computed by use of the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which for buildings is the lesser of 30 years or the remaining life of the
underlying building, up to five years for equipment, and the shorter of lease terms or ten years for leasehold improvements. the company capitalizes eligible costs to acquire or develop internal-use software that are incurred subsequent to the
preliminary project stage. capitalized costs related to internal-use software are amortized using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which range from three to five years. depreciation and amortization expense on
property and equipment was $577 million, $363 million and $249 million during 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively.asset retirement
obligationsthe company records obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets and the
associated asset retirement costs. the company reviews legal obligations associated with the retirement of long-lived assets that result from the acquisition, construction, development and/or normal use of the assets. if it is determined that a
legal obligation exists, the fair value of the liability for an asset retirement obligation is recognized in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made. the fair value of the liability is added to the
carrying amount of the associated asset and this additional carrying amount is depreciated over the life of the asset. the difference between the gross expected future cash flow and its present value is accreted over the life of the related lease as
an operating expense. all of the companys existing asset retirement obligations are associated with commitments to return property subject to operating leases to original condition upon lease termination. the companys asset retirement
liability was $25 million and $21 million as of september 26, 2009 and september 27, 2008, respectively.long-lived assets
including goodwill and other acquired intangible assetsthe company reviews property, plant and equipment and certain
identifiable intangibles, excluding goodwill, for impairment. long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. recoverability of these assets
is measured by comparison of their carrying amounts to future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate. if property, plant and equipment and certain identifiable intangibles are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be
recognized equals the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds its fair market value. the company did not record any material impairments during 2009, 2008 and 2007.the company does not amortize goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives, rather such assets are required to be tested for impairment at least annually or sooner
whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the assets may be impaired. the company performs its goodwill and intangible asset impairment tests on or about august 31 of each year. the company did not recognize any goodwill or
intangible asset impairment charges in 2009, 2008 and 2007. the company established reporting units based on its current reporting structure. for purposes of testing goodwill for impairment, goodwill has been allocated to these reporting units to
the extent it relates to each reporting unit.61



the company amortizes its intangible assets with definite lives over their estimated useful
lives and reviews these assets for impairment. the company is currently amortizing its acquired intangible assets with definite lives over periods ranging from one to ten years.foreign currency translation and remeasurementthe company translates the
assets and liabilities of its non-u.s. dollar functional currency subsidiaries into u.s. dollars using exchange rates in effect at the end of each period. revenue and expenses for these subsidiaries are translated using rates that approximate those
in effect during the period. gains and losses from these translations are credited or charged to foreign currency translation included in accumulated other comprehensive income in shareholders equity. the companys subsidiaries that use
the u.s. dollar as their functional currency remeasure monetary assets and liabilities at exchange rates in effect at the end of each period, and inventories, property, and nonmonetary assets and liabilities at historical rates. gains and losses
from these remeasurements were insignificant and have been included in the companys results of operations.revenue recognitionnet sales consist primarily of revenue from the sale of hardware, software, digital content and applications, peripherals, and
service and support contracts. for any product within these groups that either is software, or is considered software-related (e.g., mac computers, iphones and ipod portable digital music and video players), the company accounts for such products in
accordance with the specific industry accounting guidance for software and software related transactions. the company applies various revenue-related gaap for products that are not software or software-related, such as digital content sold on the
itunes store and certain mac, iphone and ipod supplies and accessories, which is described below.the company recognizes
revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the sales price is fixed or determinable, and collection is probable. product is considered delivered to the customer once it has been shipped and title and risk of
loss have been transferred. for most of the companys product sales, these criteria are met at the time the product is shipped. for online sales to individuals, for some sales to education customers in the u.s., and for certain other sales, the
company defers revenue until the customer receives the product because the company legally retains a portion of the risk of loss on these sales during transit. if at the outset of an arrangement the company determines the arrangement fee is not, or
is presumed not to be, fixed or determinable, revenue is deferred and subsequently recognized as amounts become due and payable and all other criteria for revenue recognition have been met.revenue from service and support contracts is deferred and recognized ratably over the service coverage periods. these contracts typically include extended phone support, repair
services, web-based support resources, diagnostic tools, and extend the service coverage offered under the companys standard limited warranty.the company sells software and peripheral products obtained from other companies. the company generally establishes its own pricing and retains related inventory risk, is the primary obligor in sales
transactions with its customers, and assumes the credit risk for amounts billed to its customers. accordingly, the company generally recognizes revenue for the sale of products obtained from other companies based on the gross amount billed.the company accounts for multiple element arrangements that consist only of software or software-related products in
accordance with industry specific accounting guidance for software and software related transactions. if a multiple-element arrangement includes deliverables that are neither software nor software-related, the company applies various revenue-related
gaap to determine if those deliverables constitute separate units of accounting from the software or software-related deliverables. if the company can separate the deliverables, the company applies the industry specific accounting guidance to the
software and software-related deliverables and applies other appropriate guidance to the non-software related deliverables. revenue on arrangements that include multiple elements such as hardware, software and services is allocated to each element
based on the62



relative fair value of each element. each elements allocated revenue is recognized when the revenue recognition criteria for that element have been met. fair value is generally determined
by vendor specific objective evidence (vsoe), which is based on the price charged when each element is sold separately. if the company cannot objectively determine the fair value of any undelivered element included in a multiple-element
arrangement, the company defers revenue until all elements are delivered and services have been performed, or until fair value can objectively be determined for any remaining undelivered elements. when the fair value of a delivered element has not
been established, but fair value exists for the undelivered elements, the company uses the residual method to recognize revenue if the fair value of all undelivered elements is determinable. under the residual method, the fair value of the
undelivered elements is deferred and the remaining portion of the arrangement fee is allocated to the delivered elements and is recognized as revenue.for both iphone and apple tv, the company has indicated it may from time-to-time provide future unspecified features and additional software products free of charge to customers. accordingly, iphone
handsets and apple tv sales are accounted for under subscription accounting in accordance with gaap. as such, the revenue and associated cost of sales are deferred at the time of sale, and are both recognized on a straight-line basis over the
currently estimated 24-month economic life of these products, with any loss recognized at the time of sale. costs incurred by the company for engineering, sales, marketing and warranty are expensed as incurred.the company records reductions to revenue for estimated commitments related to price protection and for customer incentive programs,
including reseller and end-user rebates, and other sales programs and volume-based incentives. the estimated cost of these programs is accrued as a reduction to revenue in the period the company has sold the product and committed to a plan. the
company also records reductions to revenue for expected future product returns based on the companys historical experience. revenue is recorded net of taxes collected from customers that are remitted to governmental authorities, with the
collected taxes recorded as current liabilities until remitted to the relevant government authority.generally, the company
does not offer specified or unspecified upgrade rights to its customers in connection with software sales or the sale of extended warranty and support contracts. when the company does offer specified upgrade rights, the company defers revenue for
the fair value of the specified upgrade right until the future obligation is fulfilled or the right to the specified upgrade expires. a limited number of the companys software products are available with maintenance agreements that grant
customers rights to unspecified future upgrades over the maintenance term on a when and if available basis. revenue associated with such maintenance is recognized ratably over the maintenance term.allowance for doubtful accountsthe company records its allowance for doubtful accounts based upon its assessment of various factors. the company considers historical experience, the age of the accounts receivable balances, credit quality of the companys customers,
current economic conditions, and other factors that may affect customers ability to pay.shipping costsfor all periods presented, amounts billed to customers related to shipping and handling are classified as revenue, and the companys
shipping and handling costs are included in cost of sales.warranty expensethe company generally provides for the estimated cost of hardware and software warranties at the time the related revenue is recognized. the company assesses the adequacy of its
preexisting warranty liabilities and adjusts the amounts as necessary based on actual experience and changes in future estimates. for products accounted for under subscription accounting, the company recognizes warranty expense as incurred.63



software development costsresearch and development costs are expensed as incurred. development costs of computer software to be sold, leased, or otherwise marketed are subject to capitalization beginning when
a products technological feasibility has been established and ending when a product is available for general release to customers. in most instances, the companys products are released soon after technological feasibility has been
established. therefore, costs incurred subsequent to achievement of technological feasibility are usually not significant, and generally most software development costs have been expensed.in 2009 and 2008, the company capitalized $71 million and $11 million, respectively, of costs associated with the development of mac os x version 10.6 snow leopard (mac os x
snow leopard), which was released during the fourth quarter of 2009. during 2007, the company capitalized $75 million of costs associated with the development of mac os x version 10.5 leopard (mac os x leopard) and iphone software.
the capitalized costs are being amortized to cost of sales on a straight-line basis over a three year estimated useful life of the underlying technology.total amortization related to capitalized software development costs was $25 million, $27 million and $13 million in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively.advertising costsadvertising costs are expensed as incurred. advertising expense was $501 million, $486 million and $467 million for 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively.stock-based compensationthe company accounts for stock-based payment
transactions in which the company receives employee services in exchange for (a) equity instruments of the enterprise or (b) liabilities that are based on the fair value of the enterprises equity instruments or that may be settled by
the issuance of such equity instruments. stock-based compensation cost for restricted stock units (rsus) is measured based on the closing fair market value of the companys common stock on the date of grant. stock-based compensation
cost for stock options is estimated at the grant date based on each options fair-value as calculated by the black-scholes-merton (bsm) option-pricing model. the company recognizes stock-based compensation cost as expense ratably on
a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. the company will recognize a benefit from stock-based compensation in equity if an incremental tax benefit is realized by following the ordering provisions of the tax law. in addition, the
company accounts for the indirect effects of stock-based compensation on the research tax credit, the foreign tax credit and the domestic manufacturing deduction through the income statement. further information regarding stock-based compensation
can be found in note 7, shareholders equity and stock-based compensation.income taxesthe provision for income taxes is computed using the asset and liability method, under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are
recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. deferred tax assets and liabilities are
measured using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in effect for the years in which those tax assets are expected to be realized or settled. the company records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the
amount that is believed more likely than not to be realized.during 2008, the company adopted fasb accounting standards
codification (asc) 740, income taxes (formerly referenced as fasb financial interpretation no. 48, accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  an64

interpretation of fasb statement no. 109), which changed the framework for accounting for uncertainty in income taxes. the company recognizes the tax benefit from an uncertain tax
position only if it is more likely than not the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are
then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon settlement. see note 6, income taxes for additional information, including the effects of adoption on the companys
consolidated financial statements.earnings per common sharebasic earnings per common share is computed by dividing income available to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the
period. diluted earnings per common share is computed by dividing income available to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period increased to include the number of additional shares of
common stock that would have been outstanding if the potentially dilutive securities had been issued. potentially dilutive securities include outstanding stock options, shares to be purchased under the employee stock purchase plan and unvested rsus.
the dilutive effect of potentially dilutive securities is reflected in diluted earnings per common share by application of the treasury stock method. under the treasury stock method, an increase in the fair market value of the companys common
stock can result in a greater dilutive effect from potentially dilutive securities.the following table sets forth the
computation of basic and diluted earnings per common share for the three years ended september 26, 2009 (in thousands, except net income in millions and per share amounts):numerator:net incomedenominator:weighted-average shares outstandingeffect of dilutive securitiesweighted-average shares dilutedbasic earnings per common sharediluted earnings per common sharepotentially dilutive securities representing 12.6 million, 10.3 million and
13.7 million shares of common stock for 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively, were excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per common share for these periods because their effect would have been antidilutive.comprehensive incomecomprehensive income consists of two components, net income and other comprehensive income. other comprehensive income refers to revenue, expenses, gains and losses that under gaap are recorded as an element of shareholders equity but
are excluded from net income. the companys other comprehensive income consists of foreign currency translation adjustments from those subsidiaries not using the u.s. dollar as their functional currency, unrealized gains and losses on
marketable securities categorized as available-for-sale, and net deferred gains and losses on certain derivative instruments accounted for as cash flow hedges.segment informationthe company reports segment information based on the

certain fixed-income investments, which resulted in the reclassification of certain investments from short-term marketable securities to long-term marketable securities. as a result, prior year balances have been reclassified to conform to the
current years presentation. the company classifies its marketable securities as either short-term or long-term based on each instruments underlying contractual maturity date, while its prior classifications were based on the nature of
the securities and their availability for use in current operations. as a result of this change, marketable securities with maturities of less than 12 months are classified as short-term and marketable securities with maturities greater than 12
months are classified as long-term. the companys long-term marketable securities maturities range from one year to five years. the company believes this new presentation is preferable as it more closely reflects the companys
assessment of the timing of when such securities will be converted to cash. accordingly, certain fixed-income investments totaling $2.4 billion have been reclassified from short-term marketable securities to long-term marketable securities in
the september 27, 2008 consolidated balance sheet to conform to the current years financial statement presentation. there have been no changes in the companys investment policies or practices associated with this change in
accounting presentation.66

the following tables summarize the companys available-for-sale securities

september 26, 2009 and net unrealized losses on its investment portfolio of $117 million as of september 27, 2008. the net unrealized gains as of september 26, 2009 and the net unrealized losses as of september 27, 2008 related
primarily to long-term marketable securities. the company may sell certain of its marketable securities prior to their stated maturities for strategic purposes, in anticipation of credit deterioration, or for duration management. the company
recognized no material net gains or losses during 2009, 2008 and 2007 related to such sales.the following table shows the
gross unrealized losses and fair value for investments in an unrealized loss position as of september 26, 2009 and september 27, 2008, aggregated by investment category and the length of time that individual securities have been in a
continuous loss position (in millions):security descriptioncorporate securitiestotalsecurity descriptionu.s. agency securitiescorporate securitiestotal67



the company considers the declines in market value of its marketable securities investment
portfolio to be temporary in nature. the unrealized losses on the companys marketable securities were caused primarily by changes in market interest rates, specifically, widening credit spreads. the company typically invests in highly-rated
securities, and its policy generally limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. the companys investment policy requires investments to be investment grade, primarily rated single-a or better, with the objective of minimizing the
potential risk of principal loss. fair values were determined for each individual security in the investment portfolio. when evaluating the investments for other-than-temporary impairment, the company reviews factors such as the length of time and
extent to which fair value has been below cost basis, the financial condition of the issuer and any changes thereto, and the companys intent to sell, or whether it is more likely than not it will be required to sell, the investment before
recovery of the investments amortized cost basis. during the years ended september 26, 2009 and september 27, 2008, the company did not recognize any material impairment charges. as of september 26, 2009, the company does not
consider any of its investments to be other-than-temporarily impaired.derivative financial instrumentsthe company uses derivatives to partially offset its business exposure to foreign currency exchange risk. the company may enter into foreign
currency forward and option contracts to offset some of the foreign exchange risk of expected future cash flows on certain forecasted revenue and cost of sales, of net investments in certain foreign subsidiaries, and on certain existing assets and
liabilities. to help protect gross margins from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, certain of the companys subsidiaries whose functional currency is the u.s. dollar, hedge a portion of forecasted foreign currency revenue. the
companys subsidiaries whose functional currency is not the u.s. dollar and who sell in local currencies, may hedge a portion of forecasted inventory purchases not denominated in the subsidiaries functional currencies. the company
typically hedges portions of its forecasted foreign currency exposure associated with revenue and inventory purchases for three to six months. to help protect the net investment in a foreign operation from adverse changes in foreign currency
exchange rates, the company may enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts to offset the changes in the carrying amounts of these investments due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. the company may also enter into
foreign currency forward and option contracts to partially offset the foreign currency exchange gains and losses generated by the re-measurement of certain assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies. however, the company may
choose not to hedge certain foreign currency exchange exposures for a variety of reasons, including but not limited to immateriality, accounting considerations and the prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures. there can be no
assurance the hedges will offset more than a portion of the financial impact resulting from movements in foreign currency exchange rates.the companys accounting policies for these instruments are based on whether the instruments are designated as hedge or non-hedge instruments. the company records all derivatives on the consolidated
balance sheets at fair value. the effective portions of cash flow hedges are recorded in other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings. the effective portions of net investment hedges are recorded in other comprehensive
income as a part of the cumulative translation adjustment. derivatives that are not designated as hedging instruments and the ineffective portions of cash flow hedges and net investment hedges are adjusted to fair value through earnings in other
income and expense.the company had a net deferred gain associated with cash flow hedges of approximately $31 million and $19
million, net of taxes, recorded in other comprehensive income as of september 26, 2009 and september 27, 2008, respectively. other comprehensive income associated with cash flow hedges of foreign currency revenue is recognized as a
component of net sales in the same period as the related revenue is recognized, and other comprehensive income related to cash flow hedges of inventory purchases is recognized as a component of cost of sales in the same period as the related costs
are recognized. the portion of the companys net deferred gain related to products under subscription accounting is expected to be recorded in earnings ratably over the related products estimated economic lives beginning when the hedged
transactions occur, while the portion of the net deferred gain related to other products is expected to be recorded in earnings at the time the hedged transactions occur. as of september 26, 2009, the hedged transactions are expected to occur
within six months.68

derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges must be de-designated as hedges when
it is probable the forecasted hedged transaction will not occur in the initially identified time period or within a subsequent two month time period. deferred gains and losses in other comprehensive income associated with such derivative instruments
are reclassified immediately into earnings through other income and expense. any subsequent changes in fair value of such derivative instruments also are reflected in current earnings unless they are re-designated as hedges of other transactions.
the company did not recognize any material net gains or losses related to the loss of hedge designation on discontinued cash flow hedges during 2009, 2008 and 2007.the company had an unrealized net loss on net investment hedges of $2 million and $1 million, net of taxes, included in the cumulative translation adjustment account of accumulated other comprehensive
income (aoci) as of september 26, 2009 and september 27, 2008, respectively. the ineffective portions and amounts excluded from the effectiveness test of net investment hedges are recorded in current earnings in other income
and expense.the company recognized in earnings a net gain of $133 million on foreign currency forward and option contracts
not designated as hedging instruments during the year ended september 26, 2009.the following table shows the notional
principal and credit risk amounts of the companys derivative instruments outstanding as of september 26, 2009 and september 27, 2008 (in millions):instruments qualifying as accounting hedges:foreign exchange contractsinstruments other than accounting hedges:foreign exchange contractsthe notional principal amounts for derivative instruments provide one measure of the
transaction volume outstanding as of september 26, 2009, and do not represent the amount of the companys exposure to credit or market loss. the credit risk amounts represent the companys gross exposure to potential accounting loss
on these transactions if all counterparties failed to perform according to the terms of the contract, based on then-current currency exchange rates at each respective date. the companys gross exposure on these transactions may be further
mitigated by collateral received from certain counterparties. the companys exposure to credit loss and market risk will vary over time as a function of currency exchange rates. although the table above reflects the notional principal and
credit risk amounts of the companys foreign exchange instruments, it does not reflect the gains or losses associated with the exposures and transactions that the foreign exchange instruments are intended to hedge. the amounts ultimately
realized upon settlement of these financial instruments, together with the gains and losses on the underlying exposures, will depend on actual market conditions during the remaining life of the instruments.the company generally enters into master netting arrangements, which reduce credit risk by permitting net settlement of transactions with
the same counterparty. to further limit credit risk, the company generally enters into collateral security arrangements that provide for collateral to be received when the net fair value of certain financial instruments exceeds contractually
established thresholds. the company presents its derivative assets and derivative liabilities at their gross fair values. the company did not record a material amount of cash collateral related to the derivative instruments under its master
netting arrangements as of september 26, 2009. the company did not have any derivative instruments with credit risk-related contingent features that would require it to post additional collateral as of september 26, 2009.the estimates of fair value are based on applicable and commonly used pricing models and prevailing financial market information as of
september 26, 2009. refer to note 3, fair value measurements of this form 10-k,69

accounts receivabletrade receivablesthe company distributes its products through third-party
distributors, cellular network carriers, and resellers and directly to certain education, consumer and enterprise customers. the company generally does not require collateral from its customers; however, the company will require collateral in
certain instances to limit credit risk. in addition, when possible, the company attempts to limit credit risk on trade receivables with credit insurance for certain customers in latin america, europe, asia, and australia, or by requiring third-party
financing, loans or leases to support credit exposure. these credit-financing arrangements are directly between the third-party financing company and the end customer. as such, the company generally does not assume any recourse or credit risk
sharing related to any of these arrangements. however, considerable trade receivables not covered by collateral, third-party financing arrangements, or credit insurance are outstanding with the companys distribution and retail channel
partners. trade receivables from one of the companys customers accounted for 16% of trade receivables as of september 26, 2009 and two of the companys customers accounted for 15% and 10%, respectively, of trade receivables as of
september 27, 2008.the following table summarizes the activity in the allowance for doubtful accounts for the three
years ended september 26, 2009 (in millions):beginning allowance balancecharged to costs and expensesdeductionsending allowance balancevendor non-trade receivablesthe company has non-trade receivables from certain of its manufacturing vendors resulting from the sale of raw material components to these manufacturing vendors who manufacture
sub-assemblies or assemble final products for the company. the company purchases these raw material components directly from suppliers. these non-trade receivables, which are included in the consolidated balance sheets in other current assets,
totaled $1.7 billion and $2.3 billion as of september 26, 2009 and september 27, 2008, respectively. vendor non-trade receivables from two of the companys vendors accounted for 40% and 36%, respectively, of non-trade receivables as
of september 26, 2009 and two of the companys vendors accounted for 47% and 38%, respectively, of non-trade receivables as of september 27, 2008. the company does not reflect the sale of these components in net sales and does not
recognize any profits on these sales until the related products are sold by the company, at which time any profit is recognized as a reduction of cost of sales.note 3  fair value measurementsthe company defines fair value as
the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. when determining the fair value measurements for assets and liabilities, which are
required to be recorded at fair value, the company considers the principal or most advantageous market in which the company would transact and the market-based risk measurements or assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset
or liability, such as inherent risk, transfer restrictions and credit risk.71

the company applies the following fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used to
measure fair value into three levels and bases the categorization within the hierarchy upon the lowest level of input that is available and significant to the fair value measurement:level 1  quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.level 2  observable inputs other than quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in inactive markets,
or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.level 3  inputs that are generally unobservable and typically reflect managements estimates of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability.the companys valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of money market funds and certain marketable equity
securities were derived from quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. the valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of all other financial instruments, all of which have counterparties with high credit ratings,
were valued based on quoted market prices or model driven valuations using significant inputs derived from or corroborated by observable market data.assets/liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basisthe following table presents the companys

deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect the effects of tax losses, credits, and the
future income tax effects of temporary differences between the consolidated financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and are measured using enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income
in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.as of september 26, 2009 and

had net tax benefits from employee stock plan awards of $246 million, $770 million and $398 million in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively, which were reflected as increases to common stock.on october 3, 2008, the tax extenders and alternative minimum tax relief act of 2008 was signed into law. this bill, among other things, retroactively extended the expired

position will be sustained upon examination. if a tax position meets the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold it is then measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the
financial statements. the tax position is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. upon adoption of these new principles, the companys cumulative effect of a
change in accounting principle resulted in an increase to retained earnings of $11 million. the company had historically classified interest and penalties and unrecognized tax benefits as current liabilities. beginning with the adoption of these new
principles, the company classifies gross interest and penalties and unrecognized tax benefits that are not expected to result in payment or receipt of cash within one year as non-current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. the total
amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits as of the date of adoption was $475 million, of which $209 million, if recognized, would affect the companys effective tax rate.the companys total gross unrecognized tax benefits are classified as non-current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. as of september 26, 2009, the total amount
of gross unrecognized tax benefits was $971 million, of which $307 million, if recognized, would affect the companys effective tax rate. as of september 27, 2008, the total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits was $506 million, of
which $253 million, if recognized, would affect the companys effective tax rate.on may 27, 2009, the united
states court of appeals for the ninth circuit issued its ruling in the case of xilinx, inc. v. commissioner, holding that stock-based compensation is required to be included in certain transfer pricing arrangements between a u.s. company
and its offshore subsidiary. as a result of the ruling in this case, the company increased its liability for unrecognized tax benefits by approximately $86 million and decreased shareholders equity by approximately $78 million in the year
ended september 26, 2009.the aggregate changes in the balance of gross unrecognized tax benefits, which excludes
interest and penalties, for the two years ended september 26, 2009, is as follows (in millions):balance as of september 30, 2007increases related to tax positions taken during a prior perioddecreases related to tax positions taken during a prior periodincreases related to tax positions taken during the current perioddecreases related to settlements with taxing authoritiesdecreases related to expiration of statute of limitationsbalance as of september 27, 2008increases related to tax positions taken during a prior perioddecreases related to tax positions taken during a prior periodincreases related to tax positions taken during the current perioddecreases related to settlements with taxing authoritiesdecreases related to expiration of statute of limitationsbalance as of september 26, 2009the companys policy to include interest and penalties related to unrecognized
tax benefits within the provision for income taxes did not change as a result of adopting the new accounting principles on accounting for uncertain tax positions in 2008. as of the date of adoption, the company had accrued $203 million for the gross
interest and penalties relating to unrecognized tax benefits. as of september 26, 2009 and september 27, 2008, the total amount of gross interest and penalties accrued was $291 million and $219 million, respectively, which is classified as
non-current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. in 2009 and 2008, the company recognized interest expense in connection with tax matters of $64 million and $16 million, respectively.the company is subject to taxation and files income tax returns in the u.s. federal jurisdiction and in many state and foreign
jurisdictions. for u.s. federal income tax purposes, all years prior to 2002 are closed. the years 2002-2003 have been examined by the internal revenue service (the irs) and disputed issues have been taken77

to administrative appeals. the irs is currently examining the 2004-2006 years. in addition, the company is also subject to audits by state, local and foreign tax authorities. in major states
and major foreign jurisdictions, the years subsequent to 1988 and 2000, respectively, generally remain open and could be subject to examination by the taxing authorities.management believes that an adequate provision has been made for any adjustments that may result from tax examinations. however, the outcome of tax audits cannot be predicted with certainty. if any issues
addressed in the companys tax audits are resolved in a manner not consistent with managements expectations, the company could be required to adjust its provision for income tax in the period such resolution occurs. although timing of the
resolution and/or closure of audits is highly uncertain, the company believes it is reasonably possible that tax audit resolutions could reduce its unrecognized tax benefits by between $105 million and $145 million in the next 12 months.note 7  shareholders equity and stock-based compensationpreferred stockthe company has five million shares of authorized
preferred stock, none of which is issued or outstanding. under the terms of the companys restated articles of incorporation, the board of directors is authorized to determine or alter the rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions of the
companys authorized but unissued shares of preferred stock.comprehensive incomecomprehensive income consists of two components, net income and other comprehensive income. other comprehensive income refers to revenue,
expenses, gains and losses that under gaap are recorded as an element of shareholders equity but are excluded from net income. the companys other comprehensive income consists of foreign currency translation adjustments from those
subsidiaries not using the u.s. dollar as their functional currency, unrealized gains and losses on marketable securities categorized as available-for-sale, and net deferred gains and losses on certain derivative instruments accounted for as cash
flow hedges.the following table summarizes the components of accumulated other comprehensive income, net of taxes, as of the

approved plan that provides for broad-based equity grants to employees, including executive officers. the 2003 plan permits the granting of incentive stock options, nonstatutory stock options, rsus, stock appreciation rights, stock purchase rights
and performance-based awards. based on the terms of individual option grants, options granted under the 2003 plan generally expire seven to ten years after the grant date and generally become exercisable over a period of four years, based on
continued employment, with either annual, semi-annual or quarterly vesting. in general, rsus granted under the 2003 plan vest over two to four years, are subject to the employees continued employment and do not have an expiration date. as of
september 26, 2009, approximately 37 million shares were reserved for future issuance under the 2003 plan.1997 employee
stock option planin august 1997, the companys board of directors approved the 1997 employee stock option
plan (the 1997 plan), a non-shareholder approved plan for grants of stock options to employees who are not officers of the company. based on the terms of individual option grants, options granted under the 1997 plan generally expire
seven to ten years after the grant date. all stock options granted under the 1997 plan are fully vested. in october 2003, the company terminated the 1997 plan, and no new options can be granted from this plan.1997 director stock option planin august 1997, the companys board of directors adopted a director stock option plan (the director plan) for non-employee directors of the company, which was approved by
shareholders in 1998. pursuant to the director plan, the companys non-employee directors are granted an option to acquire 30,000 shares of common stock upon their initial election to the board (initial options). the initial options
vest and become exercisable in three equal annual installments on each of the first through third anniversaries of the grant date. on the fourth anniversary of a non-employee directors initial election to the board and on each subsequent
anniversary thereafter, the director will be entitled to receive an option to acquire 10,000 shares of common stock (annual options). annual options are fully vested and immediately exercisable on their date of grant. options granted
under the director plan expire ten years after the grant date. as of september 26, 2009, approximately 240,000 shares were reserved for future issuance under the director plan.rule 10b5-1 trading plansas of october 16, 2009, executive

under the purchase plan are limited to 10% of an employees compensation, up to a maximum of $25,000 in any calendar year. the number of shares authorized to be purchased in any calendar
year is limited to a total of 3 million shares. as of september 26, 2009, approximately 4.7 million shares were reserved for future issuance under the purchase plan.employee savings planthe company has an employee savings plan (the
savings plan) qualifying as a deferred salary arrangement under section 401(k) of the internal revenue code. under the savings plan, participating u.s. employees may defer a portion of their pre-tax earnings, up to the irs annual
contribution limit ($16,500 for calendar year 2009). the company matches 50% to 100% of each employees contributions, depending on length of service, up to a maximum 6% of the employees eligible earnings. the companys matching
contributions to the savings plan were $59 million, $50 million and $39 million in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively.restricted stock
unitshistorically, the company used equity awards in the form of stock options as one of the means for recruiting and
retaining highly skilled talent. in conjunction with the companys 2009 equity compensation program changes, it began issuing primarily rsus rather than stock options for eligible employees as the primary type of long-term equity-based award. a
summary of the companys rsu activity and related information for the three years ended september 26, 2009, is as follows (in thousands, except per share amounts):balance at september 30, 2006restricted stock units grantedrestricted stock units vestedrestricted stock units cancelledbalance at september 29, 2007restricted stock units grantedrestricted stock units vestedrestricted stock units cancelledbalance at september 27, 2008restricted stock units grantedrestricted stock units vestedrestricted stock units cancelledbalance at september 26, 2009the fair value as of the vesting date of rsus that vested was $221 million, $320
million and $6 million for 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. upon vesting, the rsus are generally net share-settled to cover the required withholding tax and the remaining amount is converted into an equivalent number of shares of common stock. the
majority of rsus vested in 2009, 2008 and 2007, were net-share settled such that the company withheld shares with value equivalent to the employees minimum statutory obligation for the applicable income and other employment taxes, and remitted
the cash to the appropriate taxing authorities. the total shares withheld were approximately 707,000, 857,000 and 20,000 for 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively, and were based on the value of the rsus on their vesting date as determined by the
companys closing stock price. total payments for the employees tax obligations to the taxing authorities were $82 million, $124 million and $3 million in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively, and are reflected as a financing activity within
the consolidated statements of cash flows. these net-share settlements had the effect of share repurchases by the company as they reduced and retired the number of shares that would have otherwise been issued as a result of the vesting and did
not represent an expense to the company.80

life and interest rates. the expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of the companys common stock over the most recent period commensurate with the estimated expected life of the companys stock options and other
relevant factors including implied volatility in market traded options on the companys common stock. the company bases its expected life assumption on its historical experience and on the terms and conditions of the stock awards it grants to
employees. the company recognizes stock-based compensation cost as expense ratably on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period.the weighted-average assumptions used for the three years ended september 26, 2009, and the resulting estimates of weighted-average fair value per share of options granted and of employee stock
purchase plan rights (stock purchase rights) during those periods are as follows:expected life of stock optionsexpected life of stock purchase rightsinterest rate - stock optionsinterest rate - stock purchase rightsvolatility - stock optionsvolatility - stock purchase rightsdividend yieldsweighted-average fair value of stock options granted during the yearweighted-average fair value of employee stock purchase plan rights during the yearin conjunction with the companys 2009 equity compensation program changes, it began issuing primarily rsus rather than stock options to
employees, although the company continues to grant stock options to non-employee directors. accordingly the weighted average expected life of stock options was influenced by non-employee director stock option grants, which had a ten-year expected
life. the weighted average expected life of stock options also affects the resulting interest rate and expected volatility assumptions.the following table provides a summary of the stock-based compensation expense included in the consolidated statements of operations for the three years ended september 26, 2009 (in millions):cost of salesresearch and developmentselling, general and administrativetotal stock-based compensation expensestock-based compensation expense capitalized as software development costs was not

major facility leases are generally for terms of one to 20 years and generally provide renewal options for terms of one to five additional years. leases for retail space are for terms of five to
20 years, the majority of which are for ten years, and often contain multi-year renewal options. as of september 26, 2009, the companys total future minimum lease payments under noncancelable operating leases were $1.9 billion, of which
$1.5 billion related to leases for retail space.rent expense under all operating leases, including both cancelable and
noncancelable leases, was $231 million, $207 million and $151 million in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. future minimum lease payments under noncancelable operating leases having remaining terms in excess of one year as of september 26,
2009, are as follows (in millions):years20102011201220132014thereaftertotal minimum lease paymentsaccrued warranty and indemnificationsthe company offers a basic limited parts and labor warranty on its hardware products. the basic warranty period for hardware products is typically one year from the date of purchase
by the end-user. the company also offers a 90-day basic warranty for its service parts used to repair the companys hardware products. the company provides currently for the estimated cost that may be incurred under its basic limited product
warranties at the time related revenue is recognized. factors considered in determining appropriate accruals for product warranty obligations include the size of the installed base of products subject to warranty protection, historical and projected
warranty claim rates, historical and projected cost-per-claim, and knowledge of specific product failures that are outside of the companys typical experience. the company assesses the adequacy of its preexisting warranty liabilities and
adjusts the amounts as necessary based on actual experience and changes in future estimates. for products accounted for under subscription accounting, the company recognizes warranty expense as incurred.the company periodically provides updates to its applications and system software to maintain the softwares compliance with published
specifications. the estimated cost to develop such updates is accounted for as warranty costs that are recognized at the time related software revenue is recognized. factors considered in determining appropriate accruals related to such updates
include the number of units delivered, the number of updates expected to occur, and the historical cost and estimated future cost of the resources necessary to develop these updates.the following table reconciles changes in the companys accrued warranties and related costs for the three years ended september 26, 2009 (in millions):beginning accrued warranty and related costscost of warranty claimsaccruals for product warrantiesending accrued warranty and related coststhe company generally does not indemnify end-users of its operating system and
application software against legal claims that the software infringes third-party intellectual property rights. other agreements entered into by the company sometimes include indemnification provisions under which the company could be subject to
costs and/or damages in the event of an infringement claim against the company or an indemnified third-party.83



however, the company has not been required to make any significant payments resulting from such an infringement claim asserted against it or an indemnified third-party and, in the opinion of
management, does not have a potential liability related to unresolved infringement claims subject to indemnification that would materially adversely affect its financial condition or operating results. therefore, the company did not record a
liability for infringement costs as of either september 26, 2009 or september 27, 2008.the company has entered
into indemnification agreements with its directors and executive officers. under these agreements, the company has agreed to indemnify such individuals to the fullest extent permitted by law against liabilities that arise by reason of their status
as directors or officers and to advance expenses incurred by such individuals in connection with related legal proceedings. it is not possible to determine the maximum potential amount of payments the company could be required to make under these
agreements due to the limited history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each claim. however, the company maintains directors and officers liability insurance coverage to reduce its exposure to such
obligations, and payments made under these agreements historically have not materially adversely affected the companys financial condition or operating results.concentrations in the available sources of supply of materials and productalthough most components essential to the companys business are generally available from multiple sources, certain key components including but not limited to microprocessors, enclosures, certain liquid crystal displays
(lcds), certain optical drives and application-specific integrated circuits (asics) are currently obtained by the company from single or limited sources, which subjects the company to significant supply and pricing risks.
many of these and other key components that are available from multiple sources including but not limited to nand flash memory, dynamic random access memory (dram) and certain lcds, are subject at times to industry-wide shortages and
significant commodity pricing fluctuations. in addition, the company has entered into certain agreements for the supply of key components including but not limited to microprocessors, nand flash memory, dram and lcds at favorable pricing, but there
is no guarantee that the company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar favorable terms, or at all, upon expiration or otherwise obtain favorable pricing in the future. therefore, the company remains subject to significant risks
of supply shortages and/or price increases that can materially adversely affect its financial condition and operating results.the company and other participants in the personal computer, mobile communication and consumer electronics industries also compete for various components with other industries that have experienced increased demand for their products. in
addition, the company uses some custom components that are not common to the rest of the personal computer, mobile communication and consumer electronics industries, and new products introduced by the company often utilize custom components
available from only one source until the company has evaluated whether there is a need for, and subsequently qualifies, additional suppliers. when a component or product uses new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the
suppliers yields have matured or manufacturing capacity has increased. if the companys supply of a key single-sourced component for a new or existing product were delayed or constrained, if such components were available only at
significantly higher prices, or if a key manufacturing vendor delayed shipments of completed products to the company, the companys financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected. the companys business
and financial performance could also be adversely affected depending on the time required to obtain sufficient quantities from the original source, or to identify and obtain sufficient quantities from an alternative source. continued availability of
these components at acceptable prices, or at all, may be affected if those suppliers decided to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the companys requirements.significant portions of the companys mac computers, iphones, ipods, logic boards and other assembled products are now manufactured by
outsourcing partners, primarily in various parts of asia. a significant concentration of this outsourced manufacturing is currently performed by only a few of the companys outsourcing partners, often in single locations. certain of these
outsourcing partners are the sole-sourced supplier of components and manufacturing outsourcing for many of the companys key products including but not limited to final assembly of substantially all of the companys portable mac computers,
iphones, ipods and most of the companys desktop products. although84



the company works closely with its outsourcing partners on manufacturing schedules, the companys operating results could be adversely affected if its outsourcing partners were unable to
meet their production commitments. the companys purchase commitments typically cover its requirements for periods ranging from 30 to 150 days.long-term supply agreementsthe company has entered into prepaid long-term supply agreements to secure the
supply of certain inventory components. during the first quarter of 2009, a long-term supply agreement with intel corporation was terminated and the remaining prepaid balance of $167 million was repaid to the company. during the second and fourth
quarters of 2009, the company made a prepayment of $500 million to lg display for the purchase of lcd panels and a prepayment of $500 million to toshiba to purchase nand flash memory, respectively. as of september 26, 2009, the company had
a total of $1.2 billion of inventory component prepayments outstanding.contingenciesthe company is subject to certain other legal proceedings and claims that have arisen in the ordinary course of business and have not been
fully adjudicated, which are discussed in part i, item 3 of this form 10-k under the heading legal proceedings. in the opinion of management, the company does not have a potential liability related to any current legal proceedings
and claims that would individually or in the aggregate materially adversely affect its financial condition or operating results. however, the results of legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty. if the company failed to prevail in any of
these legal matters or if several of these legal matters were resolved against the company in the same reporting period, the operating results of a particular reporting period could be materially adversely affected.production and marketing of products in certain states and countries may subject the company to environmental, product safety and other
regulations including, in some instances, the requirement to provide customers the ability to return product at the end of its useful life, and place responsibility for environmentally safe disposal or recycling with the company. such laws and
regulations have been passed in several jurisdictions in which the company operates, including various countries within europe and asia and certain states and provinces within north america. although the company does not anticipate any material
adverse effects in the future based on the nature of its operations and the thrust of such laws, there is no assurance that such existing laws or future laws will not materially adversely affect the companys financial condition or operating
results.note 9  segment information and geographic datathe company reports segment information based on the management approach. the management approach designates the internal reporting used by management for making
decisions and assessing performance as the source of the companys reportable segments.the company manages its business
primarily on a geographic basis. accordingly, the company determined its operating segments, which are generally based on the nature and location of its customers, to be the americas, europe, japan, asia-pacific, retail and filemaker operations. the
companys reportable operating segments consist of americas, europe, japan and retail operations. other operating segments include asia pacific, which encompasses australia and asia except for japan and the companys filemaker, inc.
subsidiary. the americas, europe, japan and asia pacific segments exclude activities related to the retail segment. the americas segment includes both north and south america. the europe segment includes european countries, as well as the middle
east and africa. the retail segment operates apple-owned retail stores in the u.s. and in international markets. each reportable operating segment provides similar hardware and software products and similar services to the same types of customers.
the accounting policies of the various segments are the same as those described in note 1, summary of significant accounting policies.the company evaluates the performance of its operating segments based on net sales and operating income. net sales for geographic segments are generally based on the location of customers, while retail
segment net sales are based on sales from the companys retail stores. operating income for each segment includes net sales to85

are incurred. operating income for each segment excludes other income and expense and certain expenses managed outside the operating segments. costs excluded from segment operating income include various corporate expenses, such as manufacturing
costs and variances not included in standard costs, research and development, corporate marketing expenses, stock-based compensation expense, income taxes, various nonrecurring charges, and other separately managed general and administrative costs.
the company does not include intercompany transfers between segments for management reporting purposes. segment assets exclude corporate assets, such as cash, short-term and long-term investments, manufacturing and corporate facilities,
miscellaneous corporate infrastructure, goodwill and other acquired intangible assets. except for the retail segment, capital asset purchases for long-lived assets are not reported to management by segment. cash payments for capital asset purchases
by the retail segment were $369 million, $389 million and $294 million for 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively.the company has
certain retail stores that have been designed and built to serve as high-profile venues to promote brand awareness and serve as vehicles for corporate sales and marketing activities. because of their unique design elements, locations and size, these
stores require substantially more investment than the companys more typical retail stores. the company allocates certain operating expenses associated with its high-profile stores to corporate marketing expense to reflect the estimated
company-wide benefit. the allocation of these operating costs to corporate expense is based on the amount incurred for a high-profile store in excess of that incurred by a more typical company retail location. the company had opened a total of 11
high-profile stores as of september 26, 2009. expenses allocated to corporate marketing resulting from the operations of high-profile stores were $65 million, $53 million and $39 million for 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively.summary information by operating segment for the three years ended september 26, 2009 is as follows (in millions):americas:net salesoperating incomedepreciation, amortization and accretionsegment assets (a)europe:net salesoperating incomedepreciation, amortization and accretionsegment assetsjapan:net salesoperating incomedepreciation, amortization and accretionsegment assetsretail:net salesoperating incomedepreciation, amortization and accretion (b)segment assets (b)other segments (c):net salesoperating incomedepreciation, amortization and accretionsegment assets86

report of ernst & young llp, independent registered public accounting firmthe board of directors and shareholders of apple inc.we have audited apple inc.s internal control over financial reporting as of september 26, 2009, based on criteria established in internal control  integrated framework issued by the
committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission (the coso criteria). apple inc.s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the
effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying managements annual report on internal control over financial reporting. our responsibility is to express an opinion on the companys internal control
over financial reporting based on our audit.we conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the public company
accounting oversight board (united states). those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. our
audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk,
and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. we believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.a companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. a companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that,
in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance
regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.in our opinion, apple inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of september 26, 2009, based on the coso criteria.we also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board (united states), the

disclosure controls and proceduresbased on an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of the
companys management, the companys principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that the companys disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the exchange act
were effective as of september 26, 2009 to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by the company in reports that it files or submits under the exchange act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported
within the time periods specified in the securities and exchange commission rules and forms and (ii) accumulated and communicated to the companys management, including its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as
appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.inherent limitations over internal controlsthe companys internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of
financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with gaap. the companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that:pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the
companys assets;provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with gaap, and
that the companys receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of the companys management and directors; andprovide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets
that could have a material effect on the financial statements.management, including the companys
chief executive officer and chief financial officer, does not expect that the companys internal controls will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. a control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable,
not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs.
because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of internal controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. also, any evaluation of the effectiveness of
controls in future periods are subject to the risk that those internal controls may become inadequate because of changes in business conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.managements annual report on internal control over financial reportingthe companys management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in rule 13a-15(f) under the exchange act.
management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the companys internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria set forth in internal control  integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring
organizations of the treadway commission (coso). based on the companys assessment, management has concluded that its internal control over financial reporting was effective as of september 26, 2009 to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles. the companys independent registered public accounting firm,
ernst & young llp, has issued an audit report on the companys internal control over financial reporting. the report on the audit of internal control over financial reporting appears on page 90 of this form 10-k.92

## Item 1A


related to debt securities as well as equity and other investments; interest rates; cash balances; and changes in fair value of derivative
instruments. the current volatility in the financial markets and overall economic uncertainty increases the risk that the actual amounts realized in the future on the companys financial instruments could differ
significantly from the fair values currently assigned to them.uncertainty about current global economic conditions could also continue to increase
the volatility of the companys stock price.the matters relating to the companys past stock option practices and the restatement of the
companys consolidated financial statements may result in additional litigation.the findings from the companys investigation into its past
stock option granting practices and the resulting restatement of prior financial statements in the companys annual report on form 10-k for the fiscal year september 30, 2006 (the 2006 form 10-k) have exposed the company to
greater risks associated with litigation, regulatory proceedings and government enforcement actions. as described in part i, item 3, legal proceedings, several derivative complaints and a class action complaint have been filed in
state and federal courts against the company and certain current and former directors and executive officers pertaining to allegations relating to past stock option grants. the company has provided the results of its investigation to the securities
and exchange commission (the sec) and the united states attorneys office for the northern district of california, and the company has responded to their requests for documents and additional information. the company intends to
continue to provide its full cooperation.on april 24, 2007, the sec filed an enforcement action against two former officers of the company. in
announcing the lawsuit, the sec stated that it would not bring an enforcement action against the company based in part on the companys swift, extensive, and extraordinary cooperation in the commissions investigation.
according to the secs statement, the companys cooperation consisted of, among other things, prompt self-reporting, an independent internal investigation, the sharing of the results of that investigation with the government, and the
implementation of new controls designed to prevent the recurrence of fraudulent conduct. the enforcement actions against each of these former officers have now been settled.no assurance can be given regarding the outcomes from litigation relating to the companys past stock option practices. these and related matters have required, and will continue to require, the company to incur
substantial expenses for legal, accounting, tax, and other professional services, and may divert managements attention from the companys business. if the company is subject to adverse findings, it could be required to pay damages and
penalties and might face additional remedies that could harm its financial condition and operating results.global markets for personal computers,
digital music devices, mobile communication devices, and related peripherals and services are highly competitive and subject to rapid technological change. if the company is unable to compete effectively in these markets, its financial condition and
operating results could be materially adversely affected.the company competes in global markets that are highly competitive and characterized by
aggressive price cutting, with its resulting downward pressure on gross margins, frequent introduction of new products, short product life cycles, evolving industry standards, continual improvement in product price/performance characteristics, rapid
adoption of technological and product advancements by competitors, and price sensitivity on the part of consumers.the companys ability to compete
successfully depends heavily on its ability to ensure a continuing and timely introduction of new innovative products and technologies to the marketplace. the company believes it is unique in that it designs and develops nearly the entire solution
for its personal computers, consumer electronics, and mobile communication devices, including the hardware, operating system, several software applications, and related services. as a result, the company must make significant investments in research
and development and as such, the company currently holds a significant number of patents and copyrights and has registered and/or has applied to register numerous patents, trademarks and service marks. by contrast, many of the companys
competitors seek to compete primarily through aggressive pricing and very low cost structures. if the company is unable to continue to develop and sell innovative new products with attractive margins or if other companies15



infringe on the companys intellectual property, the companys ability to maintain a competitive advantage could be negatively affected and have a
materially adverse affect on its financial condition and operating results.in the market for personal computers and peripherals, the company faces a
significant number of competitors, many of which have broader product lines, lower priced products, and larger installed customer bases. consolidation in this market has resulted in larger and potentially stronger competitors. price competition has
been particularly intense as competitors selling windows-based personal computers have aggressively cut prices and lowered product margins. the company also faces increased competition in key market segments, including consumer, smb, education,
enterprise, government, and creative markets. an increasing number of internet devices that include software applications and are smaller and simpler than traditional personal computers compete for market share with the companys existing
products.the company is currently the only authorized maker of hardware using the mac os. the mac os has a minority market share in the personal computer
market, which is dominated by makers of computers using competing operating systems, most notably windows. the companys financial condition and operating results depend substantially on the companys ability to continually improve the mac
platform to maintain design and functional advantages. use of unauthorized copies of the mac os on other companies hardware products may result in decreased demand for the companys hardware products, and could materially adversely affect
the companys financial condition and operating results.the company is currently focused on certain mobile communication devices, such as iphone;
consumer electronic devices, including the ipod family of digital music players, and digital content distribution. the company faces substantial competition from companies that have significant technical, marketing, distribution, and other
resources, as well as established hardware, software, and digital content supplier relationships. the company has only recently entered the mobile communications market, and many of its competitors in the mobile communications market have
significantly greater experience, product breadth, and distribution channels than the company. the company also competes with illegitimate ways to obtain digital content. because some current and potential competitors have substantial resources and
experience and a lower cost structure, they may be able to provide such products and services at little or no profit or even at a loss. the company also expects competition to intensify as competitors attempt to imitate the companys approach
to providing these components seamlessly within their individual offerings or work collaboratively to offer integrated solutions.there can be no assurance
the company will be able to continue to provide products and services that compete effectively.to remain competitive and stimulate customer demand,
the company must successfully manage frequent product introductions and transitions.due to the highly volatile and competitive nature of the personal
computer, consumer electronics and mobile communication industries, the company must continually introduce new products and technologies, enhance existing products, and effectively stimulate customer demand for new and upgraded products. the success
of new product introductions depends on a number of factors, including timely and successful product development, market acceptance, the companys ability to manage the risks associated with new products and production ramp issues, the
availability of application software for new products, the effective management of purchase commitments and inventory levels in line with anticipated product demand, the availability of products in appropriate quantities and costs to meet
anticipated demand, and the risk that new products may have quality or other defects in the early stages of introduction. accordingly, the company cannot determine in advance the ultimate effect of new product introductions and transitions on its
financial condition and operating results.the company faces substantial inventory and other asset risk.the company records a write-down for product and component inventories that have become obsolete or exceed anticipated demand or net realizable value and accrues
necessary cancellation fee reserves for orders of excess products and components. the company also reviews its long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changed circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.
if the company determines that impairment has occurred, it records a write-down equal to the amount by which the carrying16



value of the assets exceeds its fair market value. although the company believes its inventory, asset, and related provisions are currently adequate, no
assurance can be given that, given the rapid and unpredictable pace of product obsolescence in the global personal computer, consumer electronics, and mobile communication industries, the company will not incur additional inventory or asset related
charges. such charges have had, and could have, a material adverse effect on the companys financial condition and operating results.the company must
order components for its products and build inventory in advance of product announcements and shipments. consistent with industry practice, components are normally acquired through a combination of purchase orders, supplier contracts, and open
orders based on projected demand. such purchase commitments typically cover forecasted component and manufacturing requirements for 30 to 150 days. because the companys markets are volatile, competitive and subject to rapid technology and
price changes, there is a risk the company will forecast incorrectly and order or produce excess or insufficient inventories of components or products. the companys financial condition and operating results have been in the past and could be
in the future materially adversely affected by the companys ability to manage its inventory levels and respond to short-term shifts in customer demand patterns.future operating results depend upon the companys ability to obtain key components including, but not limited to microprocessors, nand flash memory, dram and lcds at favorable prices and in sufficient
quantities.because the company currently obtains certain key components including, but not limited to microprocessors, enclosures, certain lcds,
certain optical drives, and asics, from single or limited sources, the company is subject to significant supply and pricing risks. many of these and other key components that are available from multiple sources including, but not limited to nand
flash memory, dram and certain lcds, are subject at times to industry-wide shortages and significant commodity pricing fluctuations. the company has entered into certain agreements for the supply of key components including, but not limited to
microprocessors, nand flash memory, dram and lcds at favorable pricing, but there is no guarantee that the company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar favorable terms, or at all, upon expiration or otherwise obtain favorable
pricing in the future. therefore, the company remains subject to significant risks of supply shortages and/or price increases that can have a material adverse effect on its financial condition and operating results. the company expects to experience
decreases in its gross margin percentage in future periods, as compared to levels achieved during 2008 and 2007, due largely to the anticipated impact of product transitions, flat or reduced pricing on new and innovative products that have higher
cost structures, both expected and potential future cost increases for key components, and higher logistical costs. for additional information refer to part ii, item 7, managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and
results of operations, under the subheading gross margin, which is incorporated herein by reference.the company and other participants
in the personal computer, consumer electronics and mobile communication industries compete for various components with other industries that have experienced increased demand for their products. the company uses some custom components that are not
common to the rest of the personal computer, consumer electronics or mobile communication industries. the companys new products often utilize custom components available from only one source until the company has evaluated whether there is a
need for, and subsequently qualifies, additional suppliers. when a component or product uses new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers yields have matured. continued availability of these components at
acceptable prices, or at all, may be affected if those suppliers decided to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the companys requirements. if the supply of a key single-sourced component
for a new or existing product were delayed or constrained, if such components were available only at significantly higher prices, or if a key manufacturing vendor delayed shipments of completed products to the company, the companys financial
condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected.the company depends on component and product manufacturing and logistical
services provided by third parties, many of whom are located outside of the u.s.most of the companys components and products are manufactured in
whole or in part by a few third-party manufacturers. many of these manufacturers are located outside of the u.s., and are geographically concentrated17



in single locations. the company has also outsourced much of its transportation and logistics management. while these arrangements may lower operating costs,
they also reduce the companys direct control over production and distribution. it is uncertain what effect such diminished control will have on the quality or quantity of products or services, or the companys flexibility to respond to
changing conditions. in addition, the company relies on third-party manufacturers to adhere to the companys supplier code of conduct. although arrangements with such manufacturers may contain provisions for warranty expense reimbursement, the
company may remain responsible to the consumer for warranty service in the event of product defects. any unanticipated product defect or warranty liability, whether pursuant to arrangements with contract manufacturers or otherwise, could have a
material adverse effect on the companys reputation, financial condition and operating results.final assembly of the companys products is
currently performed in the companys manufacturing facility in ireland, and by external vendors in california, korea, china and the czech republic. currently, the supply and manufacture of many critical components is performed by sole-sourced
third-party vendors in the u.s., china, japan, korea, malaysia, philippines, taiwan, thailand and singapore. sole-sourced third-party vendors in china perform final assembly of substantially all of the companys portable products, including
macbook pro, macbook, macbook air, ipods, iphones and most of the companys imacs. if manufacturing or logistics in these locations is disrupted for any reason, including natural disasters, information technology system failures, military
actions or economic, business, labor, environmental, public health, or political issues, the companys financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected.the company relies on third-party digital content, which may not be available to the company on commercially reasonable terms or at all.the company contracts with certain third parties to offer their digital content through the companys itunes store. the company pays substantial fees to obtain the
rights to audio and video content. the companys licensing arrangements with these third parties are short-term and do not guarantee the continuation or renewal of these arrangements on reasonable terms, if at all. some third-party content
providers currently or in the future may offer competing products and services, and could take action to make it more difficult or impossible for the company to license their content in the future. other content owners, providers or distributors may
seek to limit the companys access to, or increase the total cost of, such content. if the company is unable to continue to offer a wide variety of content at reasonable prices with acceptable usage rules, or continue to expand its geographic
reach, the companys financial condition and operating results may be materially adversely affected.many third-party content providers require that
the company provide certain digital rights management (drm) and other security solutions. if these requirements change, the company may have to develop or license new technology to provide these solutions. there is no assurance the
company will be able to develop or license such solutions at a reasonable cost and in a timely manner. in addition, certain countries have passed or may propose legislation that would force the company to license its drm, which could lessen the
protection of content and subject it to piracy and also could affect arrangements with the companys content providers.the company relies on
access to third-party patents and intellectual property, and the companys future results could be materially adversely affected if it is alleged or found to have infringed intellectual property rights.many of the companys products are designed to include third-party intellectual property, and in the future the company may need to seek or renew licenses relating
to various aspects of its products and business methods. although the company believes that, based on past experience and industry practice, such licenses generally could be obtained on reasonable terms, there is no assurance that the necessary
licenses would be available on acceptable terms or at all.because of technological changes in the global personal computer, consumer electronics and
mobile communication industries, current extensive patent coverage, and the rapid issuance of new patents, it is possible that certain components of the companys products and business methods may unknowingly infringe the patents or other
intellectual property rights of third parties. from time to time, the company has been notified that it may be infringing such rights. regardless of merit, responding to such claims can consume significant time and18



expense. at present, the company is vigorously defending more than 21 patent infringement cases, 13 of which were filed during fiscal 2008, and several
pending claims are in various stages of evaluation. in certain cases, the company may consider the desirability of entering into licensing agreements, although no assurance can be given that such licenses can be obtained on acceptable terms or that
litigation will not occur. if the company is found to be infringing such rights, it may be required to pay substantial damages. if there is a temporary or permanent injunction prohibiting the company from marketing or selling certain products or a
successful claim of infringement against the company requires it to pay royalties to a third party, the companys financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected, regardless of whether it can develop
non-infringing technology. while in managements opinion the company does not have a potential liability for damages or royalties from any known current legal proceedings or claims related to the infringement of patent or other intellectual
property rights that would individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on its financial condition and operating results, the results of such legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty. should the company fail to prevail
in any of the matters related to infringement of patent or other intellectual property rights of others or should several of these matters be resolved against the company in the same reporting period, the companys financial condition and
operating results could be materially adversely affected.with the june 2007 introduction of iphone, the company has begun to compete with mobile
communication device companies that hold significant patent portfolios. regardless of the scope or validity of such patents or the merits of any potential patent claims by competitors, the company may have to engage in protracted
litigation, enter into expensive agreements or settlements and/or modify its products. any of these events could have a material adverse impact on the companys financial condition and operating results.the companys future performance depends on support from third-party software developers. if third-party software applications and services cease to be developed
and maintained for the companys products, customers may choose not to buy the companys products.the company believes decisions by
customers to purchase its hardware products, including its macs, ipods and iphones, are often based to a certain extent on the availability of third-party software applications and services. there is no assurance that third-party developers will
continue to develop and maintain applications and services for the companys products on a timely basis or at all, and discontinuance or delay of these applications and services could have a material adverse effect on the companys
financial condition and operating results.with respect to its mac products, the company believes the availability of third-party software applications and
services depends in part on the developers perception and analysis of the relative benefits of developing, maintaining, and upgrading such software for the companys products compared to windows-based products. this analysis may be based
on factors such as the perceived strength of the company and its products, the anticipated revenue that may be generated, continued acceptance by customers of mac os x, and the costs of developing such applications and services. if the
companys minority share of the global personal computer market causes developers to question the companys prospects, developers could be less inclined to develop or upgrade software for the companys products and more inclined to
devote their resources to developing and upgrading software for the larger windows market. the companys development of its own software applications and services may also negatively affect the decisions of third-party developers, such as
microsoft, adobe, and google, to develop, maintain, and upgrade similar or competitive software and services for the companys products. mac os x leopard, which became available in october 2007, includes a new feature that enables intel-based
mac systems to run microsoft windows xp and windows vista operating systems. this feature may deter developers from creating software applications for mac os x if such applications are already available for the windows platform.with respect to iphone and ipod touch, the company relies on the continued availability and development of compelling and innovative software applications. as with
applications for the companys mac products, the availability and development of these applications also depend on developers perceptions and analysis of the relative benefits of developing software for the companys products rather
than its competitors, including devices that use competing platforms. if developers focus their efforts on these competing platforms, the availability and quality of applications for the companys devices may suffer.19



the companys products and services experience quality problems from time to time that can result in decreased
sales and operating margin.the company sells highly complex hardware and software products and services that can contain defects in design and
manufacture. sophisticated operating system software and applications, such as those sold by the company, often contain bugs that can unexpectedly interfere with the softwares intended operation. defects may also occur in
components and products the company purchases from third parties. there can be no assurance the company will be able to detect and fix all defects in the hardware, software and services it sells. failure to do so could result in lost revenue, harm
to reputation, and significant warranty and other expenses, and could have a material adverse impact on the companys financial condition and operating results.the company expects its quarterly revenue and operating results to fluctuate for a variety of reasons.the
companys profit margins vary among its products and its distribution channels. the companys software, accessories, and service and support contracts generally have higher gross margins than certain of the companys other products.
gross margins on the companys hardware products vary across product lines and can change over time as a result of product transitions, pricing and configuration changes, and component, warranty, and other cost fluctuations. the companys
direct sales generally have higher associated gross margins than its indirect sales through its channel partners. in addition, the companys gross margin and operating margin percentages, as well as overall profitability, may be materially
adversely impacted as a result of a shift in product, geographic or channel mix, new products, component cost increases, or price competition. the company has typically experienced greater net sales in the first and fourth fiscal quarters compared
to the second and third fiscal quarters due to seasonal demand related to the holiday season and the beginning of the school year, respectively. furthermore, the company sells more products from time-to-time during the third month of a quarter than
it does during either of the first two months. developments late in a quarter, such as lower-than-anticipated demand for the companys products, an internal systems failure, or failure of one of the companys key logistics, components
supply, or manufacturing partners, could have a material adverse impact on the companys financial condition and operating results.in certain
countries, including the u.s., the company relies on a single cellular network carrier to provide service for iphone.in the u.s., u.k., france,
germany, spain, ireland, and certain other countries, the company has contracted with a single carrier to provide cellular network services for iphone on an exclusive basis. if these exclusive carriers cannot successfully compete with other carriers
in their markets for any reason, including but not limited to the quality and coverage of wireless voice and data services, performance and timely build-out of advanced wireless networks, and pricing and other terms of conditions of end-user
contracts, or if these exclusive carriers fail to promote iphone aggressively or favor other handsets in their promotion and sales activities or service plans, sales may be materially adversely affected.the company is subject to risks associated with laws, regulations and industry-imposed standards related to mobile communications devices.laws and regulations related to mobile communications devices in the many jurisdictions in which the company operates are extensive and subject to change. such changes,
which could include but are not limited to restrictions on production, manufacture, distribution, and use of the device, locking the device to a carriers network, or mandating the use of the device on more than one carriers network,
could have a material adverse effect on the companys financial condition and operating results.mobile communication devices, such as iphone, are
subject to certification and regulation by governmental and standardization bodies, as well as by cellular network carriers for use on their networks. these certification processes are extensive and time consuming, and could result in
additional testing requirements, product modifications or delays in product shipment dates, which could have a material adverse effect on the companys financial condition and operating results.20



the company may be subject to information technology system failures, network disruptions and breaches in data
security.information technology system failures, network disruptions and breaches of data security could disrupt the companys operations by
causing delays or cancellation of customer, including channel partner, orders, negatively affecting the companys online offerings and services, impeding the manufacture or shipment of products, processing transactions and reporting financial
results, resulting in the unintentional disclosure of customer or company information, or damage to the companys reputation. while management has taken steps to address these concerns by implementing sophisticated network security and internal
control measures, there can be no assurance that a system failure or data security breach will not have a material adverse effect on the companys financial condition and operating results.the companys stock price continues to be volatile.the
companys stock has at times experienced substantial price volatility as a result of variations between its actual and anticipated financial results, announcements by the company and its competitors, or uncertainty about current global economic
conditions. the stock market as a whole also has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market price of many technology companies in ways that may have been unrelated to these companies operating performance.
furthermore, the company believes its stock price reflects high future growth and profitability expectations. if the company fails to meet these expectations its stock price may significantly decline.political events, war, terrorism, public health issues, natural disasters and other circumstances could materially adversely affect the company.war, terrorism, geopolitical uncertainties, public health issues, and other business interruptions have caused and could cause damage or disruption to international
commerce and the global economy, and thus could have a strong negative effect on the company, its suppliers, logistics providers, manufacturing vendors and customers, including channel partners. the companys business operations are subject to
interruption by natural disasters, fire, power shortages, terrorist attacks, and other hostile acts, labor disputes, public health issues, and other events beyond its control. such events could decrease demand for the companys products, make
it difficult or impossible for the company to make and deliver products to its customers, including channel partners, or to receive components from its suppliers, and create delays and inefficiencies in the companys supply chain. should major
public health issues, including pandemics, arise, the company could be negatively affected by more stringent employee travel restrictions, additional limitations in freight services, governmental actions limiting the movement of products between
regions, delays in production ramps of new products, and disruptions in the operations of the companys manufacturing vendors and component suppliers. the majority of the companys research and development activities, its corporate
headquarters, information technology systems, and other critical business operations, including certain component suppliers and manufacturing vendors, are located near major seismic faults. because the company does not carry earthquake insurance for
direct quake-related losses and significant recovery time could be required to resume operations, the companys financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected in the event of a major earthquake.the companys success depends largely on its ability to attract and retain key personnel.much of the companys future success depends on the continued service and availability of skilled personnel, including its ceo, its executive team and key employees in technical, marketing and staff positions.
experienced personnel in the technology industry are in high demand and competition for their talents is intense, especially in the silicon valley, where most of the companys key employees are located. the company has relied on equity awards
as one means for recruiting and retaining this highly skilled talent. accounting regulations requiring the expensing of stock options have resulted in increased stock-based compensation expense, which has caused the company to reduce the number of
stock-based awards issued to employees and could negatively impact the companys ability to attract and retain key personnel. additionally, significant adverse volatility in the companys stock price could result in a stock options
exercise price exceeding the underlying stocks market value or a significant deterioration in the value of restricted stock units (rsus) granted, thus lessening the21



effectiveness of retaining employees through stock-based awards. there can be no assurance that the company will continue to successfully attract and retain
key personnel.unfavorable results of legal proceedings could materially adversely affect the company.the company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that have arisen out of the ordinary conduct of its business and are not yet resolved and additional claims
may arise in the future. results of legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty. regardless of its merit, litigation may be both time-consuming and disruptive to the companys operations and cause significant expense and diversion of
management attention. in recognition of these considerations, the company may enter into material settlements. should the company fail to prevail in certain matters, or should several of these matters be resolved against the company in the same
reporting period, the company may be faced with significant monetary damages or injunctive relief against it that would materially adversely affect a portion of its business and might materially affect the companys financial condition and
operating results.the companys business is subject to the risks of international operations.the company derives a large and growing portion of its revenue and earnings from its international operations. as a result, its financial condition and operating results
could be significantly affected by risks associated with international activities, including economic and labor conditions, political instability, tax laws (including u.s. taxes on foreign subsidiaries), and changes in the value of the u.s. dollar
versus local currencies. margins on sales of the companys products in foreign countries, and on sales of products that include components obtained from foreign suppliers, could be materially adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate
fluctuations and by international trade regulations, including tariffs and antidumping penalties.the companys primary exposure to movements in
foreign currency exchange rates relate to non-u.s. dollar denominated sales in europe, japan, australia, canada, and certain parts of asia, as well as non-u.s. dollar denominated operating expenses incurred throughout the world. weakening of foreign
currencies relative to the u.s. dollar will adversely affect the u.s. dollar value of the companys foreign currency-denominated sales and earnings, and generally will lead the company to raise international pricing, potentially reducing demand
for the companys products. in some circumstances, due to competition or other reasons, the company may decide not to raise local prices to the full extent of the dollars strengthening, or at all, which would adversely affect the u.s.
dollar value of the companys foreign currency denominated sales and earnings. conversely, a strengthening of foreign currencies, while generally beneficial to the companys foreign currency-denominated sales and earnings, could cause the
company to reduce international pricing, thereby limiting the benefit. as strengthening of foreign currencies may also increase the companys cost of product components denominated in those currencies.the company has used derivative instruments, such as foreign exchange forward and option positions, to hedge certain exposures to fluctuations in foreign currency
exchange rates. the use of such hedging activities may not offset any or more than a portion of the adverse financial effects of unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates over the limited time the hedges are in place.the companys retail business has required and will continue to require a substantial investment and commitment of resources and is subject to numerous risks and
uncertainties.through september 27, 2008, the company had opened 247 retail stores. the companys retail stores have required substantial
fixed investment in equipment and leasehold improvements, information systems, inventory, and personnel. the company also has entered into substantial operating lease commitments for retail space with terms ranging from 5 to 20 years, the majority
of which are for 10 years. certain stores have been designed and built to serve as high-profile venues to promote brand awareness and serve as vehicles for corporate sales and marketing activities. because of their unique design elements, locations
and size, these stores require substantially more investment than the companys more typical retail stores. due to the high fixed cost structure associated with the retail segment, a decline in sales or the closure or poor performance of
individual or multiple stores could result in significant lease termination costs, write-offs of equipment and leasehold improvements, and severance costs that could have a material adverse effect on the companys financial condition and
operating results.22



many factors unique to retail operations, some of which are beyond the companys control, pose risks and
uncertainties that could have a material adverse effect on the retail segments future results, cause its actual results to differ from anticipated results and have a material adverse effect on the companys financial condition and
operating results. these risks and uncertainties include, among other things, macro-economic factors that could have a negative effect on general retail activity, as well as the companys inability to manage costs associated with store
construction and operation, inability to sell third-party products at adequate margins, failure to manage relationships with existing retail channel partners, more challenging environment in managing retail operations outside the u.s., costs
associated with unanticipated fluctuations in the value of retail inventory, and inability to obtain and renew leases in quality retail locations at a reasonable cost.investment in new business strategies and initiatives could disrupt the companys ongoing business and present risks not originally contemplated.the company has invested, and in the future may invest, in new business strategies or acquisitions. such endeavors may involve significant risks and uncertainties,
including distraction of management from current operations, insufficient revenue to offset liabilities assumed and expenses associated with the strategy, inadequate return of capital, and unidentified issues not discovered in the companys due
diligence. because these new ventures are inherently risky, no assurance can be given that such strategies and initiatives will be successful and will not have a material adverse effect on the companys financial condition and operating
results.the companys future operating performance depends on the performance of distributors, carriers, and other resellers.the company distributes its products through wholesalers, resellers, national and regional retailers, value-added resellers, and cataloguers, many of whom distribute
products from competing manufacturers. the company also sells many of its products and resells third-party products in most of its major markets directly to end-users, certain education customers, and certain resellers through its online and retail
stores. iphone is distributed through the company, its cellular network carriers distribution channels, and certain third-party resellers.many
resellers operate on narrow product margins and have been negatively affected in the past by weak economic conditions. some resellers have perceived the expansion of the companys direct sales as conflicting with their business interests as
distributors and resellers of the companys products. such a perception could discourage resellers from investing resources in the distribution and sale of the companys products or lead them to limit or cease distribution of those
products. the companys financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected if the financial condition of these resellers weakens, if resellers stopped distributing the companys products, or if uncertainty
regarding demand for the companys products caused resellers to reduce their ordering and marketing of the companys products. the company has invested and will continue to invest in programs to enhance reseller sales, including staffing
selected resellers stores with company employees and contractors and improving product placement displays. these programs could require a substantial investment while providing no assurance of return or incremental revenue.the company is exposed to credit risk and fluctuations in the market values of its investment portfolio.although the company has not recognized any material losses on its cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, future declines in their market values could have a
material adverse effect on the companys financial condition and operating results. given the global nature of its business, the company has investments both domestically and internationally. additionally, the companys overall investment
portfolio is often concentrated in the financial sector, which has been negatively impacted by the recent market liquidity conditions. credit ratings and pricing of these investments can be negatively impacted by liquidity, credit deterioration or
losses, financial results, or other factors. as a result, the value or liquidity of the companys cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments could decline and result in a material impairment, which could have a material adverse effect on
the companys financial condition and operating results.23

## Item 7


the company is focused on providing innovative products and solutions to consumer, smb, education, enterprise, government
and creative customers that greatly enhance their evolving digital lifestyles. the company is the only participant in the personal computer and consumer electronics industries that controls the design and development of the entire personal computer,
including the hardware, operating system, and sophisticated software applications, as well as the design and development of portable digital music players, mobile communication devices, and a variety of products and solutions for obtaining and
enjoying digital content. the company is therefore uniquely positioned to offer superior and well-integrated digital lifestyle products and solutions, which are further enhanced by the companys emphasis on ease-of-use and creative industrial
designs.the company participates in several highly competitive markets, including personal computers with its mac line of personal computers, consumer
electronics with its ipod product families, mobile communications with iphone, and distribution of third-party digital content through its online itunes store. while the company is widely recognized as a leading innovator in the personal computer
and consumer electronics markets as well as a leader in the emerging market for distribution of digital content, these markets are highly competitive and subject to aggressive pricing. to remain competitive, the company believes that increased
investment in research and development and marketing and advertising is necessary to maintain or expand its position in the markets where it competes. the companys r&d spending is focused on further developing its existing mac line of
personal computers, its operating system, application software, iphone and ipods; developing new digital lifestyle consumer and professional software applications; and investing in new product areas and technologies. the company also believes
increased investment in marketing and advertising programs is critical to increasing product and brand awareness.the company utilizes a variety of direct
and indirect distribution channels. the company believes that sales of its innovative and differentiated products are enhanced by knowledgeable salespersons who can convey the value of the hardware, software, and peripheral integration, demonstrate
the unique digital lifestyle solutions that are available only on mac computers, and demonstrate the compatibility of the mac with the windows platform and networks. the company further believes providing a high-quality sales and after-sales support
experience is critical to attracting new and retaining existing customers. to ensure a high-quality buying experience for its products in which service and education are emphasized, the company continues to expand and improve its distribution
capabilities by opening its own retail stores in the u.s. and internationally. the company had 247 stores open as of september 27, 2008.the company
has also invested in programs to enhance reseller sales, including the apple sales consultant program, which places apple employees and contractors at selected third-party reseller locations. the company believes providing direct contact with its
targeted customers is an efficient way to demonstrate the advantages of its mac computers and other products over those of its competitors. the company also sells to customers directly through its online stores around the world and through its
direct sales force.the companys ipods are sold through a significant number of distribution points to provide broad access. ipods can be purchased
in certain department stores, member-only warehouse stores, large retail chains, and specialty retail stores, as well as through the channels for mac distribution listed above.iphone is distributed through the company, its cellular network carriers distribution channels, and certain third-party resellers. the company has signed multi-year agreements with various cellular network
carriers authorizing them to distribute and provide cellular network services for iphone 3g in over 70 countries. these agreements are generally not exclusive with a specific carrier, except in the u.s., u.k., france, germany, spain, ireland, and
certain other countries. the company expects to ship iphone 3g in over 70 countries by the end of calendar year 2008.critical accounting policies and
estimatesthe preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles and the
companys discussion and analysis of its financial condition and operating results require the companys management to make judgments, assumptions, and estimates that affect the amounts37



reported in its consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. note 1 summary of significant accounting policies of notes to
consolidated financial statements in this form 10-k describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the companys consolidated financial statements. management bases its estimates on historical experience
and on various other assumptions it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. actual results may differ from these estimates and
such differences may be material.management believes the companys critical accounting policies and estimates are those related to revenue
recognition, allowance for doubtful accounts, inventory valuation and inventory purchase commitments, warranty costs, stock-based compensation, income taxes, and legal and other contingencies. management considers these policies critical because
they are both important to the portrayal of the companys financial condition and operating results, and they require management to make judgments and estimates about inherently uncertain matters. the companys senior management has
reviewed these critical accounting policies and related disclosures with the audit and finance committee of the companys board of directors.revenue recognitionnet sales consist primarily of revenue from the sale of hardware, software, music products, digital content,
peripherals, and service and support contracts. the company recognizes revenue for software products (operating system software and applications software), or any product that is considered to be software-related, in accordance with the guidance in
emerging issues task force (eitf) no. 03-5, applicability of aicpa statement of position 97-2 to non-software deliverables in an arrangement containing more-than-incidental software, (e.g., mac computers, ipod portable
digital music players and iphone) pursuant to american institute of certified public accountants (aicpa) statement of position (sop) no. 97-2, software revenue recognition, as amended. for products that are not
software or software-related, (e.g., digital content sold on the itunes store and certain mac, ipod and iphone supplies and accessories), the company recognizes revenue pursuant to the securities and exchange commission (sec) staff
accounting bulletin (sab) no. 104, revenue recognition.the company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement
exists, delivery has occurred, the sales price is fixed or determinable, and collection is probable. product is considered delivered to the customer once it has been shipped and title and risk of loss have been transferred. for most of the
companys product sales, these criteria are met at the time the product is shipped. for online sales to individuals, for some sales to education customers in the u.s., and for certain other sales, the company defers revenue until the customer
receives the product because the company retains a portion of the risk of loss on these sales during transit. if at the outset of an arrangement the company determines the arrangement fee is not, or is presumed not to be, fixed or determinable,
revenue is deferred and subsequently recognized as amounts become due and payable and all other criteria for revenue recognition have been met.for both
apple tv and iphone, the company has indicated that from time-to-time it may provide future unspecified features and additional software products free of charge to customers. therefore, sales of apple tv and iphone handsets are recognized under
subscription accounting in accordance with sop no. 97-2. the company recognizes the associated revenue and cost of goods sold on a straight-line basis over the currently estimated 24-month economic lives of these products, with any loss
recognized at the time of sale. costs incurred by the company for engineering, sales, marketing, and warranty are expensed as incurred.the company records
reductions to revenue for estimated commitments related to price protection and for customer incentive programs, including reseller and end-user rebates, and other sales programs and volume-based incentives. for transactions involving price
protection, the company recognizes revenue net of the estimated amount to be refunded, provided the refund amount can be reasonably and reliably estimated and the other conditions for revenue recognition have been met. the companys policy
requires that, if refunds cannot be reliably estimated, revenue is not recognized until reliable estimates can be made or the price protection lapses. for customer incentive programs, the estimated cost of these programs is recognized at the later
of the date at38



which the company has sold the product or the date at which the program is offered. the company also records reductions to revenue for expected future
product returns based on the companys historical experience. future market conditions and product transitions may require the company to increase customer incentive programs and incur incremental price protection obligations that could result
in additional reductions to revenue at the time such programs are offered. additionally, certain customer incentive programs require management to estimate the number of customers who will actually redeem the incentive based on historical experience
and the specific terms and conditions of particular incentive programs. if a greater than estimated proportion of customers redeem such incentives, the company would be required to record additional reductions to revenue, which would have a negative
impact on the companys results of operations.allowance for doubtful accountsthe company distributes its products through third-party distributors and resellers and directly to certain education, consumer, and enterprise customers. the company generally does not require collateral from its
customers; however, the company will require collateral in certain instances to limit credit risk. in addition, when possible the company does attempt to limit credit risk on trade receivables with credit insurance for certain customers in latin
america, europe, asia, and australia and by arranging with third-party financing companies to provide flooring arrangements and other loan and lease programs to the companys direct customers. these credit-financing arrangements are directly
between the third-party financing company and the end customer. as such, the company generally does not assume any recourse or credit-risk-sharing related to any of these arrangements. however, considerable trade receivables that are not covered by
collateral, third-party flooring arrangements, or credit insurance are outstanding with the companys distribution and retail channel partners.the
allowance for doubtful accounts is based on managements assessment of the collectibility of specific customer accounts and includes consideration of the credit worthiness and financial condition of those specific customers. the company records
an allowance to reduce the specific receivables to the amount that it reasonably believes to be collectible. the company also records an allowance for all other trade receivables based on multiple factors, including historical experience with bad
debts, the general economic environment, the financial condition of the companys distribution channels, and the aging of such receivables. if there is a deterioration of a major customers financial condition, if the company becomes aware
of additional information related to the credit-worthiness of a major customer, or if future actual default rates on trade receivables in general differ from those currently anticipated, the company may have to adjust its allowance for doubtful
accounts, which would affect earnings in the period the adjustments are made.inventory valuation and inventory purchase commitmentsthe company must order components for its products and build inventory in advance of product shipments. the company records a write-down for inventories of components and
products, including third-party products held for resale, which have become obsolete or are in excess of anticipated demand or net realizable value. the company performs a detailed review of inventory each fiscal quarter that considers multiple
factors including demand forecasts, product life cycle status, product development plans, current sales levels, and component cost trends. the personal computer, consumer electronics and mobile communications industries are subject to a rapid and
unpredictable pace of product and component obsolescence and demand changes. if future demand or market conditions for the companys products are less favorable than forecasted or if unforeseen technological changes negatively impact the
utility of component inventory, the company may be required to record additional write-downs, which would negatively affect gross margins in the period when the write-downs were recorded.the company accrues reserves for estimated cancellation fees related to component orders that have been cancelled or are expected to be cancelled. consistent with industry practice, the company acquires components
through a combination of purchase orders, supplier contracts, and open orders based on projected demand information. these commitments typically cover the companys requirements for periods ranging from 30 to 150 days. if there is an abrupt and
substantial decline in demand for one or more of the companys products or an unanticipated change in technological requirements for any of the companys products, the company may be required to record additional reserves for cancellation
fees that would negatively affect gross margins in the period when the cancellation fees are identified and recorded.39



warranty coststhe
company provides for the estimated cost for hardware and software warranties at the time the related revenue is recognized based on historical and projected warranty claim rates, historical and projected cost-per-claim, and knowledge of specific
product failures that are outside of the companys typical experience. each quarter, the company reevaluates its estimates to assess the adequacy of its recorded warranty liabilities considering the size of the installed base of products
subject to warranty protection and adjusts the amounts as necessary. for products accounted for under subscription accounting pursuant to sop no. 97-2, the company recognizes warranty expense as incurred. if actual product failure rates or
repair costs differ from estimates, revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required and could negatively affect the companys results of operations.the company periodically provides updates to its applications and operating system software to maintain the softwares compliance with specifications. the estimated cost to develop such updates is accounted for
as warranty cost that is recognized at the time related software revenue is recognized. factors considered in determining appropriate accruals related to such updates include the number of units delivered, the number of updates expected to occur,
and the historical cost and estimated future cost of the resources necessary to develop these updates.stock-based compensationthe company accounts for stock-based compensation in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards (sfas) no. 123 (revised 2004),
share-based payment. under the provisions of sfas no. 123r, stock-based compensation cost is estimated at the grant date based on the awards fair-value as calculated by the black-scholes-merton (bsm) option-pricing
model and is recognized as expense ratably on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. the bsm option-pricing model requires various judgmental assumptions including expected volatility, forfeiture rates, and expected option life.
significant changes in any of these assumptions could materially affect the fair value of stock-based awards granted in the future.income
taxesthe company records a tax provision for the anticipated tax consequences of the reported results of operations. in accordance with sfas
no. 109, accounting for income taxes, the provision for income taxes is computed using the asset and liability method, under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary
differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to taxable
income in effect for the years in which those tax assets are expected to be realized or settled. the company records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is believed more likely than not to be realized. effective at
the beginning of 2008, the company adopted financial interpretation no. (fin) 48, accounting for uncertainty in income taxes-an interpretation of fasb statement no. 109. further information may be found in note 5,
income taxes in the notes to consolidated financial statements of this form 10-k.management believes it is more likely than not that
forecasted income, including income that may be generated as a result of certain tax planning strategies, together with the tax effects of the deferred tax liabilities, will be sufficient to fully recover the remaining deferred tax assets. in the
event that the company determines all or part of the net deferred tax assets are not realizable in the future, the company will make an adjustment to the valuation allowance that would be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made.
in addition, the calculation of tax liabilities involves significant judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of fin 48 and other complex tax laws. resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with
managements expectations could have a material impact on the companys financial condition and operating results.legal and other
contingenciesas discussed in part i, item 3 of this form 10-k under the heading legal proceedings and in note 8 commitments and

various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business. in accordance with sfas no. 5, accounting for contingencies,
the company records a contingent liability when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable. there is significant judgment required in both the probability determination and as to whether an exposure can be
reasonably estimated. in managements opinion, the company does not have a potential liability related to any current legal proceedings and claims that would individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on its financial
condition or operating results. however, the outcomes of legal proceedings and claims brought against the company are subject to significant uncertainty. should the company fail to prevail in any of these legal matters or should several of these
legal matters be resolved against the company in the same reporting period, the operating results of a particular reporting period could be materially adversely affected.net salesfiscal years 2008 and 2007 spanned 52 weeks while fiscal year 2006 spanned 53 weeks. an additional week is
included in the first fiscal quarter approximately every six years to realign fiscal quarters with calendar quarters.the following table summarizes net

nm =
not meaningfulfiscal year 2008 versus 2007net sales during 2008 increased 35% or $8.5 billion from 2007. several factors contributed to these increases including the following:mac net sales increased $4.0 billion or 38% during 2008 compared to 2007, while mac unit sales increased by 2.7 million units or 38%. net sales related to the
companys mac shipments accounted for 44% of the companys total net revenue. higher mac unit sales, which contributed to the increases in net sales, were driven by higher sales of all of the companys portable products as well as the
popularity of the imac, which experienced strong growth in net sales and unit sales in all of the companys reportable segments. unit sales of the companys portable products accounted for 62% of the companys personal computer
shipments in both 2008 and 2007. net sales and unit sales of the companys portable products both increased by 38% during 2008 compared to 2007. this growth was attributable to strong demand for all the portable products, particularly the
macbook, which had double-digit growth in all of the companys operating segments, and the addition of the macbook air, which was introduced to the companys portable product line in january 2008. growth of the companys desktop
systems was also strong, with increased net sales and unit sales of 39% and 37%, respectively, during 2008 due primarily to strong sales of the imac in all of the companys operating segments.net sales of ipods increased $848 million or 10% during 2008 compared to 2007 whereas unit sales of ipods increased 6% compared to 2007. the ipod unit growth was
due to strong demand for the ipod touch, and to a lesser extent, higher unit sales of the ipod shuffle due to a price reduction in february 2008. ipod net sales grew faster than ipod unit sales due to higher average selling prices caused by a shift
in overall ipod product mix to the higher priced ipod touch.net sales of iphone and related products and services were $1.8 billion for 2008, with iphone handset unit sales totaling 11.6 million. during 2008, sales of iphone
expanded beyond the u.s. and the company expects to be shipping iphones in over 70 countries by the end of december 2008. net sales of iphone and related products and services were $123 million in 2007, which represented sales for one fiscal
quarter. iphone net sales include the portion of handset revenue recognized in accordance with subscription accounting over the products 24-month estimated economic life, as well as revenue from sales of iphone accessories and from carrier
agreements.net sales of other music related products and services increased $844 million or 34% during the 2008 compared to 2007, due primarily to significantly increased net
sales from the itunes store in each of the companys geographic segments. the company believes this success is the result of heightened consumer interest in downloading third-party digital content, the expansion of third-party audio and video
content available for sale and rent via the itunes store, and the launch of the itunes app store. the company continues to expand its itunes content offerings around the world.net sales of peripherals and other hardware increased $399 million or 32% compared to 2007 due to an increase in wireless networking products and other hardware
accessories, including printers and scanners, which was partially offset by a decrease in net sales of displays.42



net sales of software, service, and other sales rose $699 million or 46% during 2008 compared to 2007. this growth was due in large part to increased sales of
apple-branded and third-party developers software products and increased net sales of applecare protection plan (app) extended service and support contracts.fiscal year 2007 versus 2006net sales during 2007 increased
24% or $4.7 billion from 2006 even though fiscal year 2007 spanned 52 weeks while fiscal year 2006 spanned 53 weeks. several factors contributed to these increases including the following:mac net sales increased $3 billion or 40% during 2007 compared to 2006, while mac unit sales increased by 1.75 million units or 33%. the 33% mac unit sales
growth rate is significantly greater than the estimated growth rate of the overall personal computer industry during that timeframe. unit sales of the companys portable products accounted for 62% of the companys personal computer
shipments in 2007, up from 54% in 2006. net sales and unit sales of the companys portable products increased 55% and 51%, respectively, during 2007 compared to 2006. this growth was due to strong demand for the macbook, which increased in each
of the companys operating segments, as well as the macbook pro, which increased in each operating segment except japan. mac desktop net sales and unit sales increased by 21% and 12%, respectively, during 2007 due to stronger sales of the imac
in each of the companys operating segments. the mac desktop net sales growth was greater than the unit sales growth due primarily to a shift in desktop product mix away from the lower-price mac mini and discontinued emac and toward the imac.net sales of ipods increased $629 million or 8% during 2007 compared to 2006. unit sales of ipods increased 31% compared to 2006. the ipod growth was driven
primarily by increased sales of the ipod shuffle and ipod nano particularly in international markets. ipod unit sales growth was significantly greater than ipod net sales due to a shift in overall ipod product mix, as well as due to lower selling
prices for the ipod classic, ipod nano and ipod shuffle in 2007 compared to 2006.net sales of iphone and related products and services were $123 million in 2007. iphone net sales include the portion of iphone handset revenue recognized in
accordance with subscription accounting over the products 24-month estimated economic life, as well as sales of iphone accessory products and revenue from carrier agreements. iphone unit sales were 1.39 million in 2007.net sales of other music related products and services increased $611 million or 32% during 2007 compared to 2006 due to increased net sales from the itunes store.
the company believes this growth was the result of heightened consumer interest in downloading digital content and the expansion of third-party audio and video content available for sale via the itunes store.net sales of peripherals and other hardware increased $160 million or 15% compared to 2006 due to an increase in wireless networking products and other hardware
accessories, including printers and scanners, which was partially offset by a decrease in net sales of displays.net sales of software, service, and other sales rose $229 million or 18% during 2007 compared to 2006. this growth was attributable primarily to increased net sales
of app extended service and support contracts and increased sales of apple branded and third-party developers software products.segment operating performancethe company manages its business primarily on a geographic basis. the companys reportable operating
segments consist of the americas, europe, japan, and retail. the americas, europe, and japan reportable segments do not include activities related to the retail segment. the americas segment includes both north and south america. the europe segment
includes european countries as well as the middle east and africa. the retail segment operates apple-owned retail stores in the u.s. and in international markets. each reportable geographic operating segment and the retail operating segment provide
similar hardware and software products and similar services. further information regarding the companys operating segments may be found in note 9, segment information and geographic data in notes to consolidated financial
statements of this form 10-k.43



americasduring
2008, net sales in the americas segment increased $3.0 billion or 26% compared to 2007. the primary drivers of this growth were the significant year-over-year increase in sales of the ipod touch, mac portable systems, content from the itunes store,
and iphone. the company began shipping iphone in june 2007 and the growth in iphone sales in 2008 resulted from a full year of iphone shipments. the increase in mac net sales of $1.3 billion or 30% and mac unit sales of 961 million or 32% is
attributable to growth in all of the mac portable systems, particularly the macbook, and higher sales of the imac. net sales of ipods increased due to a shift in product mix toward higher priced ipods, particularly the ipod touch, which was upgraded
in june 2008. in 2008, the americas segment represented 45% of the companys total net sales as compared to 48% in the same period of 2007. during 2008, u.s. education channel net sales and mac unit sales increased by 14% and 19%, respectively,
compared to 2007. net sales from the higher education market grew 15% during 2008 compared to 2007, while net sales in the k-12 market grew 12% during the same period.during 2007, net sales in the americas segment increased $2.2 billion, or 23%, compared to 2006. the main sources of this growth were mac portable products, imacs, ipods, and the sales of third-party content from the
itunes store. sales of mac portable products increased due to the popularity of the macbook, introduced in may 2006 and updated in may 2007, as well as the macbook pro, introduced in january 2006 and updated in june 2007. sales of imacs grew due to
a shift in desktop product mix away from the mac mini and discontinued emac as well as the strong reception of the new imac introduced in august 2007. sales of ipods grew due to increased demand for the ipod nano and ipod shuffle and the
introduction of the ipod touch in september 2007. during 2007, the americas segment represented 48% of the companys total net sales as compared to 49% in the same period of 2006. during 2007, u.s. education channel net sales and mac unit sales
increased by 14% and 18%, respectively, compared to 2006. net sales from the higher education market grew 17% during 2007 compared to 2006, while net sales in the k-12 market grew 10% during the same period.europefor 2008, net sales and unit sales in europe increased 40%
and 39%, respectively, compared to the same period in 2007. the main drivers of this growth were strong sales of mac portable systems and imac, increased sales from the itunes store, and iphone. also contributing to the increase in net sales were
higher ipod net sales due primarily to the ipod touch, which was upgraded in june 2008. sales of mac portable products increased due to the macbook pro and the macbook, both updated in february 2008, as well as the macbook air, introduced in january
2008. mac desktop sales also increased due primarily to the popularity of the imac, which was updated in april 2008. sales from the itunes store grew substantially by 79% from 2007 as a result of heightened consumer interest in downloading digital
content and the expansion of third-party audio and video content available for sale via the itunes store. the europe segment represented 23% of total net sales in 2008, consistent with 2007.europe segment net sales increased $1.4 billion or 33% during 2007 compared to 2006. consistent with the americas segment, the primary drivers of this growth were mac
portable products, imacs, ipods, and the sales of third-party content from the itunes store. sales of mac portable products increased due to the popularity of both the macbook and macbook pro. sales of imacs grew due to a shift in desktop product
mix away from the mac mini and discontinued emac as well as the strong reception of the new imac introduced in august 2007. sales of ipods grew due primarily to increased demand for the ipod nano and ipod shuffle. the company believes that the
growth in itunes store sales was the result of heightened consumer interest in downloading digital content and the expansion of third-party audio and video content available for sale via the itunes store.japanjapan net sales increased $427 million or 39% in 2008 compared
to 2007. the primary contributors to the growth in net sales were increases in sales of ipods, imac, mac portable systems, and strong sales from the itunes store. net sales, unit sales and the average selling price of ipods increased during 2008
compared to 2007, driven by strong demand for ipod touch and ipod nano. additionally, mac net sales and unit sales grew 42% and 29%, respectively, in 2008 compared to 2007 due to increase in sales of the imac and mac portable systems, particularly
macbook, as well as the introduction of macbook air in january 2008.44



japans net sales declined by $129 million or 11% in 2007 compared to 2006. total mac unit sales in japan declined
1% during 2007. the decrease in the japan segments overall net sales was attributable primarily to decreases in ipod and mac desktop sales, partially offset by an increase in revenue from macbooks and sales of third-party content from the
itunes store. the decline in net sales and mac unit sales is partially attributable to japans declining consumer pc market, and the ipod sales decline is due primarily to lower average selling prices. the company is continuing to evaluate ways
to improve the future results of its japan segment.retailretail net sales grew by 53% during 2008 compared to 2007, due in large part to increased sales of mac portable and desktop products, strong demand for the iphone and ipod touch, and new store openings. the company opened 50 new retail
stores during 2008, including a total of 19 international stores, bringing the total number of open stores to 247 as of september 27, 2008. this compares to 197 open stores as of september 29, 2007 and 165 open stores as of
september 30, 2006. with an average of 211 stores and 178 stores opened during 2008 and 2007, respectively, average revenue per store increased to $29.9 million for 2008, compared to $23.1 million in 2007.retail mac net sales and mac unit sales grew by 42% and 47%, respectively, during 2008 compared to the 2007, due primarily to strong demand for macbook, imac, and macbook
air, introduced in january 2008. net sales of ipods increased due to the popularity of the ipod touch, which was upgraded in june 2008, and a higher average selling price compared to 2007. the higher ipod average selling price was due to strong
demand for the ipod touch.the retail segments net sales increased by 27% to $4.1 billion during 2007 compared to 2006. retail segment mac unit sales
increased 56% during 2007 as compared to 2006. with an average of 178 stores open during 2007, average revenue per store was $23.1 million, compared to $22.9 million in 2006. the increase in retail segment net sales during 2007 compared to 2006 was
due primarily to stronger sales of mac portable products, imacs, accessories and services. the increase was partially offset primarily by lower net sales of ipods and other music related products due to the expanded availability of those products
through third-party resellers.as measured by the companys operating segment reporting, the retail segment reported operating income of $1.3 billion
during 2008 as compared to operating income of $875 million and $600 million during 2007 and 2006, respectively. this improvement in 2008 was attributable primarily to the significant retail net sales growth of 53% as compared to 2007.expansion of the retail segment has required and will continue to require a substantial investment in fixed assets and related infrastructure, operating lease
commitments, personnel, and other operating expenses. capital asset purchases associated with the retail segment were $389 million in 2008, bringing the total capital asset purchases since inception of the retail segment to $1.4 billion. as of
september 27, 2008, the retail segment had approximately 15,900 full-time equivalent employees and had outstanding operating lease commitments associated with retail store space and related facilities of $1.4 billion. the company would incur
substantial costs if it were to close multiple retail stores. such costs could adversely affect the companys financial condition and operating results.other segmentsthe companys other segments, which consist of its asia pacific and filemaker operations, experienced an increase in
net sales of $707 million, or 40% during 2008 as compared to 2007. these increases are related primarily to strong growth in sales of all mac portable systems, ipods, the imac, and content from the itunes store in the companys asia pacific
region. sales from the itunes store in the companys asia pacific region grew significantly by 109% over 2007. mac net sales and unit sales grew by 52% and 50%, respectively, due to increased sales of the imac and all mac portables.the companys other segments experienced an increase in net sales of $406 million, or 30% during 2007 compared to 2006. this increase related primarily to a 58%
increase in sales of mac portable products and strong ipod sales in the companys asia pacific region.45

gross margingross
margin for the three fiscal years ended september 27, 2008, are as follows (in millions, except gross margin percentages):net salescost of salesgross margingross margin percentagegross margin percentage was relatively flat in 2008 as compared to 2007. gross margin percentage of 34.0% in 2007
increased significantly from 29.0% in 2006. the primary drivers of this increase were more favorable costs on certain commodity components, including nand flash memory and dram memory, higher overall revenue that provided for more leverage on fixed
production costs and a higher percentage of revenue from the companys direct sales channels.the company expects its gross margin percentage to
decrease in future periods compared to levels achieved during 2008 and 2007, and anticipates gross margin levels of about 30% in 2009. this expected decline is due largely to the anticipated impact of product transitions, flat or reduced pricing on
new and innovative products that have higher cost structures, both expected and potential future cost increases for key components, a stronger u.s. dollar, and higher logistical costs.the foregoing statements regarding the companys expected gross margin percentage are forward-looking and could differ from anticipated levels because of several factors, including but not limited to certain of
those set forth below in part i, item 1a, risk factors under the subheading future operating results depend upon the companys ability to obtain key components including, but not limited to microprocessors, nand flash
memory, dram and lcds at favorable prices and in sufficient quantities, which is incorporated herein by reference. there can be no assurance that targeted gross margin percentage levels will be achieved. in general, gross margins and
margins on individual products will remain under downward pressure due to a variety of factors, including continued industry wide global product pricing pressures, increased competition, compressed product life cycles, product transitions and
expected increases in the cost of key components including, but not limited to microprocessors, nand flash memory, dynamic random access memory (dram) and liquid crystal displays (lcds), as well as potential increases in the
costs of outside manufacturing services and a potential shift in the companys sales mix towards products with lower gross margins. in response to these competitive pressures, the company expects it will continue to take product pricing
actions, which would adversely affect gross margins. gross margins could also be affected by the companys ability to manage product quality and warranty costs effectively and to stimulate demand for certain of its products. due to the
companys significant international operations, financial results can be significantly affected in the short-term by fluctuations in exchange rates.operating expensesoperating expenses for the three fiscal years ended september 27, 2008, are as follows (in millions, except for

the current year to support expanded r&d activities and higher stock-based compensation expenses. in 2008, $11 million of software development costs were capitalized46

related to mac os x version 10.6 snow leopard and excluded from r&d expense, while r&d expense for 2007 excluded $75 million of capitalized software
development costs related to mac os x leopard and iphone. although total r&d expense increased 42% during 2008, it remained relatively flat as a percentage of net sales given the 35% increase in revenue during 2008. the company continues to
believe that focused investments in r&d are critical to its future growth and competitive position in the marketplace and are directly related to timely development of new and enhanced products that are central to the companys core
business strategy. as such, the company expects to increase spending in r&d to remain competitive.expenditures for r&d increased 10% or $70
million to $782 million in 2007 compared to 2006. the increases in r&d expense were due primarily to an increase in r&d headcount in 2007 to support expanded r&d activities, partially offset by one less week of expenses in the first
quarter of 2007 and the capitalized software development costs mentioned above.selling, general, and administrative expense (sg&a)expenditures for sg&a increased $798 million or 27% to $3.8 billion in 2008 compared to 2007. these increases are due primarily to higher
stock-based compensation expenses, higher variable selling expenses resulting from the significant year-over-year increase in total net sales and the companys continued expansion of its retail segment in both domestic and international
markets. in addition, the company incurred higher spending on marketing and advertising during 2008 compared to 2007.expenditures for sg&a increased
$530 million or 22% during 2007 compared to 2006. the increase was due primarily to higher direct and indirect channel variable selling expenses resulting from the significant year-over-year increase in total net sales in 2007, the companys
continued expansion of its retail segment in both domestic and international markets, and higher spending on marketing and advertising, partially offset by one less week of expenses in the first quarter of 2007.other income and expenseother income and expense for the three
fiscal years ended september 27, 2008, are as follows (in millions):interest incomeother income (expense), nettotal other income and expensetotal other income and expense increased $21 million to $620 million during 2008 as compared to $599 million
and $365 million in 2007 and 2006, respectively. while the companys cash, cash equivalents and short-term investment balances increased by 59% in 2008, other income and expense increased only 4% due to the decline in the weighted average
interest rate earned of 3.44%. the overall increase in other income and expense is attributable to the companys higher cash and short-term investment balances, which more than offset the decline in interest rates during 2008 as compared to
2007. the weighted average interest rate earned by the company on its cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments was 5.27% and 4.58% during 2007 and 2006, respectively. during 2008, 2007 and 2006, the company had no debt outstanding and
accordingly did not incur any related interest expense.provision for income taxesthe companys effective tax rates were 30% for the years ended september 27, 2008 and september 29, 2007, and 29% for the year ended september 30, 2006. the companys effective rates differ
from the statutory federal income tax rate of 35% due primarily to certain undistributed foreign earnings for which no u.s. taxes are provided because such earnings are intended to be indefinitely reinvested outside the u.s.as of september 27, 2008, the company had deferred tax assets arising from deductible temporary differences, tax losses, and tax credits of $2.1 billion before being
offset against certain deferred liabilities for presentation on the companys balance sheet. management believes it is more likely than not that forecasted income, including47



income that may be generated as a result of certain tax planning strategies, together with the tax effects of the deferred tax liabilities, will be
sufficient to fully recover the remaining deferred tax assets. the company released a valuation allowance of $5 million since it has been determined that it is more likely than not the associated deferred tax assets will be realized. the company
will continue to evaluate the realizability of deferred tax assets quarterly by assessing the need for and amount of the valuation allowance.the internal
revenue service (the irs) has completed its field audit of the companys federal income tax returns for the years 2002 through 2003 and proposed certain adjustments. the company has contested certain of these adjustments through the
irs appeals office. all irs audit issues for years prior to 2002 have been resolved. in addition, the company is subject to audits by state, local, and foreign tax authorities. management believes that adequate provision has been made for any
adjustments that may result from tax examinations. however, the outcome of tax audits cannot be predicted with certainty. if any issues addressed in the companys tax audits are resolved in a manner not consistent with managements
expectations, the company could be required to adjust its provision for income tax in the period such resolution occurs.recent accounting
pronouncementsin september 2006, the financial accounting standards board (fasb) issued sfas no. 157, fair value measurements,
which defines fair value, provides a framework for measuring fair value, and expands the disclosures required for fair value measurements. sfas no. 157 applies to other accounting pronouncements that require fair value measurements; it does not
require any new fair value measurements. in february 2008, the fasb issued fasb staff position (fsp) no. fas 157-1, application of fasb statement no. 157 to fasb statement no. 13 and other accounting pronouncements that
address fair value measurements for purposes of lease classification or measurement under statement 13 and fsp no. fas 157-2, effective date of fasb statement no. 157. fsp 157-1 amends sfas no. 157 to remove certain leasing
transactions from its scope. fsp 157-2 delays the effective date of sfas no. 157 to fiscal years beginning after november 15, 2008 for all non-financial assets and non-financial liabilities, except for items that are recognized
or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis (at least annually) and will be adopted by the company beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2010. in october 2008, the fasb issued fsp no. 157-3, determining the
fair value of a financial asset when the market for that asset is not active, to clarify the application of sfas 157 in inactive markets for financial assets. fsp 157-3 became effective upon issuance and sfas no. 157 is effective for fiscal
years beginning after november 15, 2007 and will be adopted by the company beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2009. although the company will continue to evaluate the application of sfas no. 157, management does not currently believe
adoption will have a material impact on the companys financial condition or operating results.in february 2007, the fasb issued sfas no. 159,
the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities-including an amendment of fasb statement no. 115. sfas no. 159 allows companies to choose to measure eligible financial instruments and certain other items at
fair value that are not required to be measured at fair value. sfas no. 159 requires that unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected be reported in earnings at each reporting date. sfas no. 159 is
effective for fiscal years beginning after november 15, 2007 and will be adopted by the company beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2009. although the company will continue to evaluate the application of sfas no. 159, management does
not currently believe adoption will have a material impact on the companys financial condition or operating results.in december 2007, the fasb
issued sfas no. 141 (revised 2007), business combinations, which establishes principles and requirements for how an acquirer recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed,
and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree in a business combination. sfas no. 141r also establishes principles around how goodwill acquired in a business combination or a gain from a bargain purchase should be recognized and measured, as
well as provides guidelines on the disclosure requirements on the nature and financial impact of the business combination. sfas no. 141r is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after december 15, 2008 and will be adopted by the
company beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2010. although the company will continue to evaluate the application of sfas no. 141r, management does not currently believe adoption will have a material impact on the companys financial
condition or operating results.48

an increase of $9.1 billion from september 29, 2007. the principal components of this net increase were cash generated by operating activities of $9.6 billion, proceeds from the issuance of common stock under stock plans of $483 million and
excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation of $757 million. these increases were partially offset by payments for acquisitions of property, plant, and equipment of $1.1 billion, payments made in connection with business acquisitions, net of
cash acquired, of $220 million and payments for acquisitions of intangible assets of $108 million. the companys cash generated by operating activities significantly exceeded its net income due primarily to the large increase in deferred
revenue, net of deferred costs, associated with subscription accounting for iphone.the companys short-term investment portfolio is invested
primarily in highly rated securities with a minimum rating of single-a. as of september 27, 2008 and september 29, 2007, $11.3 billion and $6.5 billion, respectively, of the companys cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments
were held by foreign subsidiaries and are generally based in u.s. dollar-denominated holdings. the company had $117 million in net unrealized losses on its investment portfolio, primarily related to investments with stated maturities ranging from
one to five years, as of september 27, 2008, and net unrealized losses of approximately $11 million on its investment portfolio, primarily related to investments with stated maturities from one to five years, as of september 29, 2007. the
company has the intent and ability to hold such investments for a sufficient period of time to allow for recovery of the principal amounts invested. accordingly, none of these declines in fair value were recognized in the companys
statement of operations.the company believes its existing balances of cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments will be sufficient to satisfy its
working capital needs, capital expenditures, outstanding commitments, and other liquidity requirements associated with its existing operations over the next 12 months.capital assetsthe companys cash payments for capital asset purchases were $1.1 billion during 2008,
consisting of $389 million for retail store facilities and $702 million for real estate acquisitions and corporate infrastructure including information systems enhancements. the company anticipates utilizing approximately $1.5 billion for capital
asset purchases during 2009, including approximately $400 million for retail facilities and approximately $1.1 billion for corporate facilities and infrastructure.49

off-balance sheet arrangements and contractual obligationsthe company has not entered into any transactions with unconsolidated entities whereby the company has financial guarantees, subordinated retained interests, derivative
instruments, or other contingent arrangements that expose the company to material continuing risks, contingent liabilities, or any other obligation under a variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing, liquidity, market
risk, or credit risk support to the company.the following table presents certain payments due by the company under contractual obligations with minimum
firm commitments as of september 27, 2008 and excludes amounts already recorded on the companys balance sheet as current liabilities (in millions):operating leasespurchase obligationsasset retirement obligationsother obligationstotallease commitmentsas of september 27, 2008, the company had total outstanding commitments on noncancelable operating leases of $1.8 billion, $1.4 billion of which related to the lease of retail space and related facilities. the companys major
facility leases are generally for terms of 3 to 20 years and generally provide renewal options for terms of 1 to 5 additional years. leases for retail space are for terms of 5 to 20 years, the majority of which are for 10 years, and often contain
multi-year renewal options.purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and component suppliersthe company utilizes several contract manufacturers to manufacture sub-assemblies for the companys products and to perform final assembly and test of finished
products. these contract manufacturers acquire components and build product based on demand information supplied by the company, which typically covers periods ranging from 30 to 150 days. the company also obtains individual components for its
products from a wide variety of individual suppliers. consistent with industry practice, the company acquires components through a combination of purchase orders, supplier contracts, and open orders based on projected demand information. such
purchase commitments typically cover the companys forecasted component and manufacturing requirements for periods ranging from 30 to 150 days. in addition, the company has an off-balance sheet warranty obligation for products accounted for
under subscription accounting pursuant to sop no. 97-2 whereby the company recognizes warranty expense as incurred. as of september 27, 2008, the company had outstanding off-balance sheet third-party manufacturing commitments, component
purchase commitments, and estimated warranty commitments of $5.4 billion.during 2006, the company entered into long-term supply agreements with hynix
semiconductor, inc., intel corporation, micron technology, inc., samsung electronics co., ltd., and toshiba corporation to secure supply of nand flash memory through calendar year 2010. as part of these agreements, the company prepaid $1.25 billion
for flash memory components during 2006, which will be applied to certain inventory purchases made over the life of each respective agreement. the company utilized $567 million of the prepayment as of september 27, 2008.asset retirement obligationsthe companys asset retirement
obligations are associated with commitments to return property subject to operating leases to original condition upon lease termination. as of september 27, 2008, the company estimated that gross expected future cash flows of $28 million would
be required to fulfill these obligations.50


## Item 7A


equivalents, while highly liquid investments with initial maturities greater than three months at the date of purchase are classified as short-term
investments. as of september 27, 2008 and september 29, 2007, approximately $2.4 billion and $1.9 billion, respectively, of the companys short-term investments had underlying maturities ranging from one to five years. the remainder
all had underlying maturities of less than 12 months. the company may sell its investments prior to their stated maturities for strategic purposes, in anticipation of credit deterioration, or for duration management. the company recognized no
material net gains or losses during 2008, 2007 and 2006 related to such sales.to provide a meaningful assessment of the interest rate risk associated with
the companys investment portfolio, the company performed a sensitivity analysis to determine the impact a change in interest rates would have on the value of the investment portfolio assuming a 100 basis point parallel shift in the yield
curve. based on investment positions as of september 27, 2008, a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates across all maturities would result in a $46 million incremental decline in the fair market value of the portfolio. as of
september 29, 2007, a similar 100 basis point shift in the yield curve would have resulted in a $16 million incremental decline in the fair market value of the portfolio. such losses would only be realized if the company sold the investments
prior to maturity.foreign currency riskin general,
the company is a net receiver of currencies other than the u.s. dollar. accordingly, changes in exchange rates, and in particular a strengthening of the u.s. dollar, will negatively affect the companys net sales and gross margins as expressed
in u.s. dollars. there is also a risk that the company will have to adjust local currency product pricing due to competitive pressures when there has been significant volatility in foreign currency exchange rates.the company may enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts with financial institutions to protect against foreign exchange risks associated with existing
assets and liabilities, certain firmly committed transactions, forecasted future cash flows, and net investments in foreign subsidiaries. generally, the companys practice is to hedge a majority of its material foreign exchange exposures,
typically for three to six months. however, the company may choose not to hedge certain foreign exchange exposures due to immateriality, prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures, and limited availability of appropriate hedging
instruments.to provide a meaningful assessment of the foreign currency risk associated with certain of the companys foreign currency derivative
positions, the company performed a sensitivity analysis using a value-at-risk (var) model to assess the potential impact of fluctuations in exchange rates. the var model consisted of using a monte carlo simulation to generate 3,000
random market price paths. the var is the maximum expected loss in fair value, for a given confidence interval, to the companys foreign exchange portfolio due to adverse movements in rates. the var model is not intended to represent actual
losses but is used as a risk estimation and management tool. the model assumes normal market conditions. forecasted transactions, firm commitments, and assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies were excluded from the model. based on
the results of the model, the company estimates with 95% confidence a maximum one-day loss in fair value of $60 million as of september 27, 2008 compared to a maximum one-day loss in fair value of $13 million as of september 29, 2007.
because the company uses foreign currency instruments for hedging purposes, losses incurred on those instruments are generally offset by increases in the fair value of the underlying exposures.actual future gains and losses associated with the companys investment portfolio and derivative positions may differ materially from the sensitivity analyses
performed as of september 27, 2008 due to the inherent limitations associated with predicting the changes in the timing and amount of interest rates, foreign currency exchanges rates, and the companys actual exposures and positions.52

notes to consolidated financial statementsnote 1-summary of significant accounting policiesapple inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries (collectively apple or the company) design,
manufacture, and market personal computers, portable digital music players, and mobile communication devices and sell a variety of related software, services, peripherals, and networking solutions. the company sells its products worldwide through
its online stores, its retail stores, its direct sales force, and third-party wholesalers, resellers, and value-added resellers. in addition, the company sells a variety of third-party mac, ipod and iphone compatible products including application
software, printers, storage devices, speakers, headphones, and various other accessories and supplies through its online and retail stores. the company sells to consumer, small and mid-sized business (smb), education, enterprise,
government, and creative customers.basis of presentation and preparationthe accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the company. intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. the preparation of these consolidated financial statements in
conformity with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in these consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. actual results could differ
materially from those estimates. certain prior year amounts in the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation.the companys fiscal year is the 52 or 53-week period that ends on the last saturday of september. the companys first quarter of fiscal years 2008 and 2007 contained 13 weeks and the first quarter of fiscal
year 2006 contained 14 weeks. the companys fiscal years 2008 and 2007 ended on september 27, 2008 and september 29, 2007, respectively, included 52 weeks, while fiscal year 2006 ended on september 30, 2006 included 53 weeks.
unless otherwise stated, references to particular years or quarters refer to the companys fiscal years ended in september and the associated quarters of those fiscal years.financial instrumentscash equivalents and short-term investmentsall highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase are classified as cash equivalents. highly liquid investments with
maturities greater than three months at the date of purchase are classified as short-term investments. the companys debt and marketable equity securities have been classified and accounted for as available-for-sale. management determines the
appropriate classification of its investments in debt securities at the time of purchase and reevaluates the available-for-sale designations as of each balance sheet date. these securities are carried at fair value, with the unrealized gains and
losses, net of taxes, reported as a component of shareholders equity. the cost of securities sold is based upon the specific identification method.derivative financial instrumentsthe company accounts for its derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities and carries them at
fair value. derivatives that are not defined as hedges in statement of financial accounting standards (sfas) no. 133, accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities, as amended, must be adjusted to fair value
through earnings.for derivative instruments that hedge the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows that are designated as cash flow hedges,
the effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative instrument is reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income in shareholders equity and reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the
hedged transaction affects earnings. the ineffective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative instrument is recognized in current earnings. to receive hedge accounting treatment, cash flow hedges must be highly effective in offsetting changes
to expected future cash flows on hedged transactions. for options designated as cash flow hedges, changes in the time value are excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and are recognized in earnings. for derivative instruments that hedge
the exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset or a liability and that are designated as fair value hedges, the net58



notes to consolidated financial statements (continued)note 1-summary of significant accounting policies (continued)gain or loss on the derivative instrument as well as the offsetting gain or loss on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are recognized in
earnings in the current period. the net gain or loss on the effective portion of a derivative instrument that is designated as an economic hedge of the foreign currency translation exposure of the net investment in a foreign operation is reported in
the same manner as a foreign currency translation adjustment. for forward contracts designated as net investment hedges, the company excludes changes in fair value relating to changes in the forward carry component from its definition of
effectiveness. accordingly, any gains or losses related to this component are recognized in current earnings.inventoriesinventories are stated at the lower of cost, computed using the first-in, first-out method, or market. if the cost of the inventories exceeds their market value,
provisions are made currently for the difference between the cost and the market value. the companys inventories consist primarily of finished goods for all periods presented.property, plant, and equipmentproperty, plant, and equipment are stated at cost. depreciation is computed by use of
the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which for buildings is the lesser of 30 years or the remaining life of the underlying building, up to 5 years for equipment, and the shorter of lease terms or 10 years for
leasehold improvements. the company capitalizes eligible costs to acquire or develop internal-use software that are incurred subsequent to the preliminary project stage. capitalized costs related to internal-use software are amortized using the
straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which range from 3 to 5 years. depreciation and amortization expense on property and equipment was $363 million, $249 million, and $180 million during 2008, 2007, and 2006
respectively.asset retirement obligationsthe
company records obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs in accordance with sfas no. 143, accounting for asset retirement obligations. the company reviews legal
obligations associated with the retirement of long-lived assets that result from the acquisition, construction, development and/or normal use of the assets. if it is determined that a legal obligation exists, the fair value of the liability for an
asset retirement obligation is recognized in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made. the fair value of the liability is added to the carrying amount of the associated asset and this additional carrying
amount is depreciated over the life of the asset. the difference between the gross expected future cash flow and its present value is accreted over the life of the related lease as an operating expense. all of the companys existing asset
retirement obligations are associated with commitments to return property subject to operating leases to original condition upon lease termination. the companys asset retirement liability was $21 million and $18 million as of
september 27, 2008 and september 29, 2007, respectively.long-lived assets including goodwill and other acquired intangible assetsthe company reviews property, plant, and equipment and certain identifiable intangibles, excluding goodwill, for impairment in accordance with sfas
no. 144, accounting for the impairment of long-lived assets and for long-lived assets to be disposed of. long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset
may not be recoverable. recoverability of these assets is measured by comparison of its carrying amount to future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate. if property, plant, and equipment and certain identifiable intangibles are
considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized equals the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds its fair market value. the company did not record any material impairments during 2008, 2007, and 2006.59



notes to consolidated financial statements (continued)note 1-summary of significant accounting policies (continued)sfas no. 142, goodwill and other intangible assets requires that goodwill and intangible assets with
indefinite useful lives should not be amortized but rather be tested for impairment at least annually or sooner whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that they may be impaired. the company performs its goodwill impairment tests on or
about august 31 of each year. the company did not recognize any goodwill or intangible asset impairment charges in 2008, 2007, or 2006. the company established reporting units based on its current reporting structure. for purposes of testing
goodwill for impairment, goodwill has been allocated to these reporting units to the extent it relates to each reporting unit.sfas no. 142 also
requires that intangible assets with definite lives be amortized over their estimated useful lives and reviewed for impairment in accordance with sfas no. 144. the company is currently amortizing its acquired intangible assets with definite
lives over periods ranging from 1 to 10 years.foreign currency translationthe company translates the assets and liabilities of its international non-u.s. dollar functional currency subsidiaries into u.s. dollars using exchange rates in effect at the end of each period. revenue and expenses
for these subsidiaries are translated using rates that approximate those in effect during the period. gains and losses from these translations are credited or charged to foreign currency translation included in accumulated other comprehensive income
in shareholders equity. the companys foreign manufacturing subsidiaries and certain other international subsidiaries that use the u.s. dollar as their functional currency remeasure monetary assets and liabilities at exchange rates in
effect at the end of each period, and inventories, property, and nonmonetary assets and liabilities at historical rates. gains and losses from these translations were insignificant and have been included in the companys results of operations.revenue recognitionnet sales consist primarily of
revenue from the sale of hardware, software, music products, digital content, peripherals, and service and support contracts. for any product within these groups that either is software, or is considered software-related in accordance with the
guidance in emerging issues task force (eitf) no. 03-5, applicability of aicpa statement of position 97-2 to non-software deliverables in an arrangement containing more-than-incidental software (e.g., mac computers, ipod
portable digital music players and iphones), the company accounts for such products in accordance with the revenue recognition provisions of american institute of certified public accountants (aicpa) statement of position
(sop) no. 97-2, software revenue recognition, as amended. the company applies staff accounting bulletin (sab) no. 104, revenue recognition, for products that are not software or software-related, such
as digital content sold on the itunes store and certain mac, ipod and iphone supplies and accessories.the company recognizes revenue when persuasive
evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the sales price is fixed or determinable, and collection is probable. product is considered delivered to the customer once it has been shipped and title and risk of loss have been
transferred. for most of the companys product sales, these criteria are met at the time the product is shipped. for online sales to individuals, for some sales to education customers in the u.s., and for certain other sales, the company defers
revenue until the customer receives the product because the company legally retains a portion of the risk of loss on these sales during transit. if at the outset of an arrangement the company determines the arrangement fee is not, or is presumed not
to be, fixed or determinable, revenue is deferred and subsequently recognized as amounts become due and payable and all other criteria for revenue recognition have been met.revenue from service and support contracts is deferred and recognized ratably over the service coverage periods. these contracts typically include extended phone support, repair services, web-based support resources,
diagnostic tools, and extend the service coverage offered under the companys one-year limited warranty.60



notes to consolidated financial statements (continued)note 1-summary of significant accounting policies (continued)the company sells software and peripheral products obtained from other companies. the company generally establishes
its own pricing and retains related inventory risk, is the primary obligor in sales transactions with its customers, and assumes the credit risk for amounts billed to its customers. accordingly, the company generally recognizes revenue for the sale
of products obtained from other companies based on the gross amount billed.the company accounts for multiple element arrangements that consist only of
software or software-related products in accordance with sop no. 97-2. if a multiple-element arrangement includes deliverables that are neither software nor software-related, the company applies eitf no. 00-21, revenue arrangements with
multiple deliverables, to determine if those deliverables constitute separate units of accounting from the sop no. 97-2 deliverables. if the company can separate the deliverables, the company applies sop no. 97-2 to the software and
software-related deliverables and applies other appropriate guidance (e.g., sab no. 104) to the deliverables outside the scope of sop no. 97-2. revenue on arrangements that include multiple elements such as hardware, software, and services
is allocated to each element based on the relative fair value of each element. each elements allocated revenue is recognized when the revenue recognition criteria for that element have been met. fair value is generally determined by vendor
specific objective evidence (vsoe), which is based on the price charged when each element is sold separately. if the company cannot objectively determine the fair value of any undelivered element included in a multiple-element
arrangement, the company defers revenue until all elements are delivered and services have been performed, or until fair value can objectively be determined for any remaining undelivered elements. when the fair value of a delivered element has not
been established, the company uses the residual method to recognize revenue if the fair value of all undelivered elements is determinable. under the residual method, the fair value of the undelivered elements is deferred and the remaining portion of
the arrangement fee is allocated to the delivered elements and is recognized as revenue.the company records reductions to revenue for estimated
commitments related to price protection and for customer incentive programs, including reseller and end-user rebates, and other sales programs and volume-based incentives. the estimated cost of these programs is accrued as a reduction to revenue in
the period the company has sold the product and committed to a plan. the company also records reductions to revenue for expected future product returns based on the companys historical experience. revenue is recorded net of taxes collected
from customers that are remitted to governmental authorities, with the collected taxes recorded as current liabilities until remitted to the relevant government authority.generally, the company does not offer specified or unspecified upgrade rights to its customers in connection with software sales or the sale of extended warranty and support contracts. when the company does offer
specified upgrade rights, the company defers revenue for the fair value of the specified upgrade right until the future obligation is fulfilled or when the right to the specified upgrade expires. additionally, a limited number of the companys
software products are available with maintenance agreements that grant customers rights to unspecified future upgrades over the maintenance term on a when and if available basis. revenue associated with such maintenance is recognized ratably over
the maintenance term.in 2007, the company began shipping apple tv and iphone. for apple tv and iphone, the company indicated it may from time-to-time
provide future unspecified features and additional software products free of charge to customers. accordingly, apple tv and iphone handsets sales are accounted for under subscription accounting in accordance with sop no. 97-2. as such, the
companys policy is to defer the associated revenue and cost of goods sold at the time of sale, and recognize both on a straight-line basis over the currently estimated 24-month economic life of these products, with any loss recognized at the
time of sale. costs incurred by the company for engineering, sales, marketing and warranty are expensed as incurred.61



notes to consolidated financial statements (continued)note 1-summary of significant accounting policies (continued)allowance for doubtful accountsthe company records its allowance for doubtful accounts based upon its assessment of various factors. the company considers historical experience, the age of the accounts receivable balances, credit quality of the
companys customers, current economic conditions, and other factors that may affect customers ability to pay.shipping costsfor all periods presented, amounts billed to customers related to shipping and handling are classified as revenue, and the companys shipping and handling costs
are included in cost of sales.warranty expensethe
company generally provides for the estimated cost of hardware and software warranties at the time the related revenue is recognized. the company assesses the adequacy of its preexisting warranty liabilities and adjusts the amounts as necessary based
on actual experience and changes in future estimates. for products accounted for under subscription accounting pursuant to sop no. 97-2, the company recognizes warranty expense as incurred.software development costsresearch and development costs are
expensed as incurred. development costs of computer software to be sold, leased, or otherwise marketed are subject to capitalization beginning when a products technological feasibility has been established and ending when a product is
available for general release to customers pursuant to sfas no. 86, computer software to be sold, leased, or otherwise marketed. in most instances, the companys products are released soon after technological feasibility has been
established. therefore, costs incurred subsequent to achievement of technological feasibility are usually not significant, and generally most software development costs have been expensed.during 2008, the company capitalized $11 million of costs associated with the development of mac os x version 10.6 snow leopard. in 2007, the company determined that both
mac os x version 10.5 leopard (mac os x leopard) and iphone achieved technological feasibility. during 2007, the company capitalized $75 million of costs associated with the development of leopard and iphone. in accordance with sfas
no. 86, the capitalized costs related to mac os x leopard and iphone are amortized to cost of sales commencing when each respective product begins shipping and are recognized on a straight-line basis over a 3 year estimated useful life of the
underlying technology.total amortization related to capitalized software development costs was $27 million, $13 million, and $18 million in 2008, 2007, and
2006, respectively.advertising costsadvertising
costs are expensed as incurred. advertising expense was $486 million, $467 million, and $338 million for 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively.stock-based compensationthe company applies sfas no. 123 (revised 2004), share-based payment, for stock-based payment
transactions in which the company receives employee services in exchange for (a) equity instruments of the enterprise or (b) liabilities that are based on the fair value of the enterprises equity instruments or that may be settled by
the issuance of such equity instruments. the company uses the black-scholes-merton (bsm) option-pricing model to determine the fair-value of stock-based awards under sfas no. 123r.sfas no. 123r prohibits recognition of a deferred tax asset for an excess tax benefit that has not been realized. the company will recognize a benefit from
stock-based compensation in equity if an incremental tax benefit is62



notes to consolidated financial statements (continued)note 1-summary of significant accounting policies (continued)realized by following the ordering provisions of the tax law. in addition, the company accounts for the indirect effects of stock-based compensation on the
research tax credit, the foreign tax credit, and the domestic manufacturing deduction through the income statement.further information regarding
stock-based compensation can be found in note 6, shareholders equity, and note 7, stock-based compensation.income taxesin accordance with sfas no. 109, accounting for income taxes, the provision for income taxes is computed using the asset and liability
method, under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, and for operating losses and tax credit

valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is believed more likely than not to be realized.during 2008, the company adopted the
financial accounting standards boards (fasb) financial interpretation no. (fin) 48, accounting for uncertainty in income taxes-an interpretation of fasb statement no. 109. fin 48 changes the accounting
for uncertainty in income taxes by creating a new framework for how companies should recognize, measure, present, and disclose uncertain tax positions in their financial statements. under fin 48, the company may recognize the tax benefit from an
uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such
positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon settlement. fin 48 also provides guidance on the reversal of previously recognized tax positions, balance sheet classifications,
accounting for interest and penalties associated with tax positions, and income tax disclosures. see note 5, income taxes for additional information, including the effects of adoption on the companys consolidated financial
statements.earnings per common sharebasic earnings
per common share is computed by dividing income available to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. diluted earnings per common share is computed by dividing income available to
common shareholders by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period increased to include the number of additional shares of common stock that would have been outstanding if the potentially dilutive securities
had been issued. potentially dilutive securities include outstanding stock options, shares to be purchased under the employee stock purchase plan, and unvested restricted stock units (rsus). the dilutive effect of potentially dilutive
securities is reflected in diluted earnings per share by application of the treasury stock method. under the treasury stock method, an increase in the fair market value of the companys common stock can result in a greater dilutive effect from
potentially dilutive securities.63

september 29, 2007, aggregated by investment category and the length of time that individual securities have been in a continuous loss position (in millions):security descriptionu.s. treasury and agency securitiesu.s. corporate securitiesforeign securitiestotalsecurity descriptionu.s. treasury and agency securitiesu.s. corporate securitiesforeign securitiestotalthe unrealized losses on the companys investments in u.s. treasury and agency securities, u.s. corporate
securities, and foreign securities were caused primarily by changes in interest rates, specifically, widening credit spreads. the companys investment policy requires investments to be rated single-a or better with the objective of minimizing
the potential risk of principal loss. therefore, the company considers the declines to be temporary in nature. fair values were determined for each individual security in the investment portfolio. when evaluating the investments for
other-than-temporary impairment, the company reviews factors such as the length of time and extent to which fair value has been below cost basis, the financial condition of the issuer, and the companys ability and intent to hold the investment
for a period of time, which may be sufficient for anticipated recovery in market value. during 2008, the company did not record any material impairment charges on its outstanding securities. as of september 27, 2008, the company does not
consider any of its investments to be other-than-temporarily impaired.accounts receivabletrade receivablesthe company distributes its products through
third-party distributors and resellers and directly to certain education, consumer, and commercial customers. the company generally does not require collateral from its customers. in addition, when possible, the company attempts to limit credit risk
on trade receivables with credit insurance for certain customers in latin america, europe, asia, and australia and by arranging with third-party financing companies to provide flooring arrangements and other loan and lease programs to the
companys direct customers. these credit-financing arrangements are directly between the third-party financing company and the end customer. as such, the company generally does not assume any recourse or credit risk sharing related to any of
these arrangements. however, considerable trade receivables not covered by collateral, third-party flooring arrangements, or credit insurance are outstanding with the companys distribution and retail channel partners. trade receivables from
two of the companys customers accounted for 15% and 10% of trade receivables as of september 27, 2008, while one customer accounted for approximately 11% of trade receivables as of september 29, 2007.66

products for the company. the company purchases these raw material components directly from suppliers. these non-trade receivables, which are included in the consolidated balance sheets in other current assets, totaled $2.3 billion and $2.4 billion
as of september 27, 2008 and september 29, 2007, respectively. the company does not reflect the sale of these components in net sales and does not recognize any profits on these sales until the related products are sold by the company, at
which time the profit is recognized as a reduction of cost of sales.derivative financial instrumentsthe company uses derivatives to partially offset its business exposure to foreign exchange risk. foreign currency forward and option contracts are used to offset the
foreign exchange risk on certain existing assets and liabilities and to hedge the foreign exchange risk on expected future cash flows on certain forecasted revenue and cost of sales. the companys accounting policies for these instruments are
based on whether the instruments are designated as hedge or non-hedge instruments. the company records all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value.the following table shows the notional principal, net fair value, and credit risk amounts of the companys foreign currency instruments as of september 27, 2008 and september 29, 2007 (in millions):foreign exchange instruments qualifying as accounting hedges:spot/forward contractspurchased optionssold optionsforeign exchange instruments other than accounting hedges:spot/forward contractspurchased optionsthe notional principal amounts for derivative instruments provide one measure of the transaction volume outstanding
as of year-end, and do not represent the amount of the companys exposure to credit or market loss. the credit risk amounts shown in the table above represents the companys gross exposure to potential accounting loss on these transactions
if all counterparties failed to perform according to the terms of the contract, based on then-current currency exchange rates at each respective date. the companys exposure to credit loss and market risk will vary over time as a function of
currency exchange rates.67



notes to consolidated financial statements (continued)note 2-financial instruments (continued)the estimates of fair value are based on applicable and commonly used pricing models and prevailing financial market
information as of september 27, 2008 and september 29, 2007. although the table above reflects the notional principal, fair value, and credit risk amounts of the companys foreign exchange instruments, it does not reflect the gains or
losses associated with the exposures and transactions that the foreign exchange instruments are intended to hedge. the amounts ultimately realized upon settlement of these financial instruments, together with the gains and losses on the underlying
exposures, will depend on actual market conditions during the remaining life of the instruments.foreign exchange risk managementthe company may enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts with financial institutions to protect against foreign exchange risk associated with existing
assets and liabilities, certain firmly committed transactions, forecasted future cash flows, and net investments in foreign subsidiaries. generally, the companys practice is to hedge some portion of its material foreign exchange exposures.
however, the company may choose not to hedge certain foreign exchange exposures for a variety of reasons, including but not limited to, immateriality, prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures, or limited availability of appropriate
hedging instruments.to help protect gross margins from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, certain of the companys u.s. dollar
functional subsidiaries hedge a portion of forecasted foreign currency revenue, and the companys non-u.s. dollar functional subsidiaries selling in local currencies hedge a portion of forecasted inventory purchases not denominated in the
subsidiaries functional currency. other comprehensive income associated with hedges of foreign currency revenue is recognized as a component of net sales in the same period as the related sales are recognized, and other comprehensive income
related to inventory purchases is recognized as a component of cost of sales in the same period as the related costs are recognized. typically, the company hedges portions of its forecasted foreign currency exposure associated with revenue and
inventory purchases for three to six months.derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges must be de-designated as hedges when it is probable the
forecasted hedged transaction will not occur in the initially identified time period or within a subsequent 2 month time period. deferred gains and losses in other comprehensive income associated with such derivative instruments are immediately
reclassified into earnings in other income and expense. any subsequent changes in fair value of such derivative instruments are also reflected in current earnings unless they are re-designated as hedges of other transactions. the company has not
recognized any material net gains during 2008, 2007 and 2006, related to the loss of a hedge designation on discontinued cash flow hedges. as of september 27, 2008, the company had a net deferred gain associated with cash flow hedges of
approximately $19 million, net of taxes, substantially all of which is expected to be reclassified to earnings by the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2009.the net gain or loss on the effective portion of a derivative instrument designated as a net investment hedge is included in the cumulative translation adjustment account of accumulated other comprehensive income within shareholders
equity. for the years ended september 27, 2008 and september 29, 2007, the company had a net loss on net investment hedges of $12.2 million and $2.6 million, respectively, included in the cumulative translation adjustment.the company may also enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts to offset the foreign exchange gains and losses generated by the re-measurement of certain
assets and liabilities recorded in non-functional currencies. changes in the fair value of these derivatives are recognized in current earnings in other income and expense as offsets to the changes in the fair value of the related assets or
liabilities. due to currency market movements, changes in option time value can lead to increased volatility in other income and expense.68

financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and are measured using enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be

the first quarter of 2008, the company adopted fin 48. upon adoption of fin 48, the companys cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle resulted in an increase to retained earnings of $11 million. the company had historically
classified interest and penalties and unrecognized tax benefits as current liabilities. beginning with the adoption of fin 48, the company classifies gross interest and penalties and unrecognized tax benefits that are not expected to result in
payment or receipt of cash within one year as non-current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet. the total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits as of the date of adoption of fin 48 was $475 million, of which $209 million, if

rate. the companys total gross unrecognized tax benefits are classified as non-current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet.the aggregate
changes in the balance of gross unrecognized tax benefits, which excludes interest and penalties, for the fiscal year ended september 27, 2008, is as follows (in millions):balance as of september 30, 2007increases related to tax positions taken during a prior perioddecreases related to tax positions taken during a prior periodincreases related to tax positions taken during the current perioddecreases related to settlements with taxing authoritiesdecreases related to expiration of statute of limitationsbalance as of september 27, 2008the companys policy to include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within the
provision for income taxes did not change as a result of adopting fin 48. as of the date of adoption, the company had accrued $203 million for the gross interest and penalties relating to unrecognized tax benefits. as of september 27, 2008, the
total amount of gross interest and penalties accrued was $219 million, which is classified as non-current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet. in 2008, the company recognized interest expense in connection with tax matters of $16 million.the company is subject to taxation and files income tax returns in the u.s. federal jurisdiction and in many state and foreign jurisdictions. for u.s.
federal income tax purposes, all years prior to 2002 are closed. the years 2002-2003 have been examined by the internal revenue service (the irs) and disputed issues have been taken to administrative appeals. the irs is currently
examining the 2004-2006 years. in addition, the company is also subject to audits by state, local, and foreign tax authorities. in major states and major foreign jurisdictions, the years subsequent to 1988 and 2000, respectively, generally
remain open and could be subject to examination by the taxing authorities.management believes that an adequate provision has been made for any adjustments
that may result from tax examinations. however, the outcome of tax audits cannot be predicted with certainty. if any issues addressed in the companys tax audits are resolved in a manner not consistent with managements expectations, the
company could be required to adjust its provision for income tax in the period such resolution occurs. although timing of the resolution and/or closure of audits is highly uncertain, the company does not believe it is reasonably possible that its
unrecognized tax benefits would materially change in the next 12 months.73

the rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions of the companys authorized but unissued shares of preferred stock.ceo restricted stock
awardon march 19, 2003, the companys board of directors granted 10 million shares of restricted stock to the companys ceo
that vested on march 19, 2006. the amount of the restricted stock award expensed by the company was based on the closing market price of the companys common stock on the date of grant and was amortized ratably on a straight-line basis
over the three-year requisite service period. upon vesting during 2006, the 10 million shares of restricted stock had a fair value of $646.6 million and had grant-date fair value of $7.48 per share. the restricted stock award was net-share
settled such that the company withheld shares with value equivalent to the ceos minimum statutory obligation for the applicable income and other employment taxes, and remitted the cash to the appropriate taxing authorities. the total shares
withheld of 4.6 million were based on the value of the restricted stock award on the vesting date as determined by the companys closing stock price of $64.66. the remaining shares net of those withheld were delivered to the companys
ceo. total payments for the ceos tax obligations to the taxing authorities was $296 million in 2006 and are reflected as a financing activity within the consolidated statements of cash flows. the net-share settlement had the effect of
share repurchases by the company as it reduced and retired the number of shares outstanding and did not represent an expense to the company. the companys ceo has no remaining shares of restricted stock. for the year ended september 30,
2006, compensation expense related to restricted stock was $4.6 million.comprehensive incomecomprehensive income consists of two components, net income and other comprehensive income. other comprehensive income refers to revenue, expenses, gains, and losses that
under u.s. generally accepted accounting principles are recorded as an element of shareholders equity but are excluded from net income. the companys other comprehensive income consists of foreign currency translation adjustments from
those subsidiaries not using the u.s. dollar as their functional currency, unrealized gains and losses on marketable securities categorized as available-for-sale, and net deferred gains and losses on certain derivative instruments accounted for as
cash flow hedges.the following table summarizes the components of accumulated other comprehensive income, net of taxes, as of the three fiscal years ended

including executive officers. based on the terms of individual option grants, options granted under the 2003 plan generally expire 7 to 10 years after the grant date and generally become exercisable over a period of four years, based on continued
employment, with either annual or quarterly vesting. the 2003 plan permits the granting of incentive stock options, nonstatutory stock options, rsus, stock appreciation rights, stock purchase rights and performance-based awards. as of
september 27, 2008, approximately 50.3 million shares were reserved for future issuance under the 2003 plan.1997 employee stock option
planin august 1997, the companys board of directors approved the 1997 employee stock option plan (the 1997 plan), a
non-shareholder approved plan for grants of stock options to employees who are not officers of the company. based on the terms of individual option grants, options granted under the 1997 plan generally expire 7 to 10 years after the grant date and
generally become exercisable over a period of four years, based on continued employment, with either annual or quarterly vesting. in october 2003, the company terminated the 1997 plan and no new options can be granted from this plan.1997 director stock option planin
august 1997, the companys board of directors adopted a director stock option plan (the director plan) for non-employee directors of the company, which was approved by shareholders in 1998. pursuant to the director plan, the
companys non-employee directors are granted an option to acquire 30,000 shares of common stock upon their initial election to the board (initial options). the initial options vest and become
exercisable in three equal annual installments on each of the first through third anniversaries of the grant date. on the fourth anniversary of a non-employee directors initial election to the board and on each subsequent anniversary
thereafter, the director will be entitled to receive an option to acquire 10,000 shares of common stock (annual options). annual options are fully vested and immediately exercisable on their date of grant. options granted under the
director plan expire 10 years after the grant date. as of september 27, 2008, approximately 290,000 shares were reserved for future issuance under the director plan.rule 10b5-1 trading plansthe following executive officers, timothy d. cook, peter oppenheimer, philip w.

notes to consolidated financial statements (continued)note 7-stock-based compensationsfas no. 123r requires the use of a valuation model to calculate the fair value of stock-based awards. the
company uses the bsm option-pricing model to calculate the fair value of stock-based awards. the bsm option-pricing model incorporates various assumptions including expected volatility, expected life, and interest rates. the expected
volatility is based on the historical volatility of the companys common stock over the most recent period commensurate with the estimated expected life of the companys stock options and other relevant factors including implied volatility
in market traded options on the companys common stock. the company bases its expected life assumption on its historical experience and on the terms and conditions of the stock awards it grants to employees. stock-based compensation cost is
estimated at the grant date based on the awards fair-value as calculated by the bsm option-pricing model and is recognized as expense ratably on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period.the compensation expense incurred by the company for rsus is based on the closing market price of the companys common stock on the date of grant and is amortized
ratably on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period.the weighted-average assumptions used for the three fiscal years ended

offers a 90-day basic warranty for its service parts used to repair the companys hardware products. the company provides currently for the estimated cost that may be incurred under its basic limited product warranties at the time related
revenue is recognized. factors considered in determining appropriate accruals for product warranty obligations include the size of the installed base of products subject to warranty protection, historical and projected warranty claim rates,
historical and projected cost-per-claim, and knowledge of specific product failures that are outside of the companys typical experience. the company assesses the adequacy of its preexisting warranty liabilities and adjusts the amounts as
necessary based on actual experience and changes in future estimates. for products accounted for under subscription accounting pursuant to sop no. 97-2, the company recognizes warranty expense as incurred.the company periodically provides updates to its applications and system software to maintain the softwares compliance with published specifications. the estimated
cost to develop such updates is accounted for as warranty costs that are recognized at the time related software revenue is recognized. factors considered in determining appropriate accruals related to such updates include the number of units
delivered, the number of updates expected to occur, and the historical cost and estimated future cost of the resources necessary to develop these updates.the following table reconciles changes in the companys accrued warranties and related costs for the three fiscal years ended september 27, 2008 (in millions):beginning accrued warranty and related costscost of warranty claimsaccruals for product warrantiesending accrued warranty and related coststhe company generally does not indemnify end-users of its operating system and application software against legal
claims that the software infringes third-party intellectual property rights. other agreements entered into by the company sometimes include indemnification provisions under which the company could be subject to costs and/or damages in the event of
an infringement claim against the company or an indemnified third-party.80



notes to consolidated financial statements (continued)note 8-commitments and contingencies (continued)however, the company has not been required to make any significant payments resulting from such an infringement claim asserted against it or an indemnified
third-party and, in the opinion of management, does not have a potential liability related to unresolved infringement claims subject to indemnification that would have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or operating results.
therefore, the company did not record a liability for infringement costs as of either september 27, 2008 or september 29, 2007.concentrations in the available sources of supply of materials and productalthough most components essential to the companys
business are generally available from multiple sources, certain key components including, but not limited to microprocessors, enclosures, certain liquid crystal displays (lcds), certain optical drives, and application-specific integrated
circuits (asics) are currently obtained by the company from single or limited sources, which subjects the company to significant supply and pricing risks. many of these and other key components that are available from multiple sources
including, but not limited to nand flash memory, dynamic random access memory (dram), and certain lcds, are subject at times to industry-wide shortages and significant commodity pricing fluctuations. in addition, the company has entered
into certain agreements for the supply of key components including, but not limited to microprocessors, nand flash memory, dram and lcds at favorable pricing, but there is no guarantee that the company will be able to extend or renew these
agreements on similar favorable terms, or at all, upon expiration or otherwise obtain favorable pricing in the future. therefore, the company remains subject to significant risks of supply shortages and/or price increases that can have a material
adverse effect on its financial condition and operating results.the company and other participants in the personal computer, consumer electronics and
mobile communication industries also compete for various components with other industries that have experienced increased demand fortheir products. in
addition, the company uses some custom components that are not common to the rest of the personal computer, consumer electronics and mobile communication industries, and new products introduced by the company often utilize custom components
available from only one source until the company has evaluated whether there is a need for, and subsequently qualifies, additional suppliers. when a component or product uses new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the
suppliers yields have matured. if the companys supply of a key single-sourced component for a new or existing product were delayed or constrained, if such components were available only at significantly higher prices, or if a key
manufacturing vendor delayed shipments of completed products to the company, the companys financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected. the companys business and financial performance could also be
adversely affected depending on the time required to obtain sufficient quantities from the original source, or to identify and obtain sufficient quantities from an alternative source. continued availability of these components at acceptable prices,
or at all, may be affected if those suppliers decided to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the companys requirements.significant portions of the companys mac computers, ipods, iphones, logic boards, and other assembled products are now manufactured by outsourcing partners, primarily in various parts of asia. a significant
concentration of this outsourced manufacturing is currently performed by only a few of the companys outsourcing partners, often in single locations. certain of these outsourcing partners are the sole-sourced supplier of components and
manufacturing outsourcing for many of the companys key products including, but not limited to final assembly of substantially all of the companys portable mac computers, ipods, iphones and most of the companys imacs. although the
company works closely with its outsourcing partners on manufacturing schedules, the companys operating results could be adversely affected if its outsourcing partners were unable to meet their production commitments. the companys
purchase commitments typically cover its requirements for periods ranging from 30 to 150 days.81



notes to consolidated financial statements (continued)note 8-commitments and contingencies (continued)long-term supply agreementsduring 2006, the company entered into long-term supply agreements with hynix semiconductor, inc., intel corporation, micron technology, inc., samsung electronics co., ltd., and toshiba corporation to secure supply of
nand flash memory through calendar year 2010. as part of these agreements, the company prepaid $1.25 billion for flash memory components during 2006, which will be applied to certain inventory purchases made over the life of each respective
agreement. the company utilized $567 million of the prepayment as of september 27, 2008.contingenciesthe company is subject to certain other legal proceedings and claims that have arisen in the ordinary course of business and have not been fully adjudicated. in the
opinion of management, the company does not have a potential liability related to any current legal proceedings and claims that would individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or operating results.
however, the results of legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty. if the company failed to prevail in any of these legal matters or if several of these legal matters were resolved against the company in the same reporting period, the
operating results of a particular reporting period could be materially adversely affected.production and marketing of products in certain states and
countries may subject the company to environmental, product safety and other regulations including, in some instances, the requirement to provide customers the ability to return product at the end of its useful life, and place responsibility for
environmentally safe disposal or recycling with the company. such laws and regulations have been passed in several jurisdictions in which the company operates, including various countries within europe and asia, certain canadian provinces and
certain states within the u.s. although the company does not anticipate any material adverse effects in the future based on the nature of its operations and the thrust of such laws, there is no assurance that such existing laws or future laws will
not have a material adverse effect on the companys financial condition or operating results.note 9-segment information and geographic datain accordance with sfas no. 131, disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information, the company
reports segment information based on the management approach. the management approach designates the internal reporting used by management for making decisions and assessing performance as the source of the companys reportable
segments.the company manages its business primarily on a geographic basis. accordingly, the company determined its operating segments, which are
generally based on the nature and location of its customers, to be the americas, europe, japan, asia-pacific, retail, and filemaker operations. the companys reportable operating segments consist of americas, europe, japan, and retail
operations. other operating segments include asia pacific, which encompasses australia and asia except for japan, and the companys filemaker, inc. subsidiary. the americas, europe, japan, and asia pacific segments exclude activities related to
the retail segment. the americas segment includes both north and south america. the europe segment includes european countries, as well as the middle east and africa. the retail segment operates apple-owned retail stores in the u.s. and in
international markets. each reportable operating segment provides similar hardware and software products and similar services to the same types of customers. the accounting policies of the various segments are the same as those described in note 1,
summary of significant accounting policies.the company evaluates the performance of its operating segments based on net sales and operating
income. net sales for geographic segments are generally based on the location of customers, while retail segment net sales are based on sales from the companys retail stores. operating income for each segment includes net sales to third
parties, related cost of sales, and operating expenses directly attributable to the segment. advertising82



notes to consolidated financial statements (continued)note 9-segment information and geographic data (continued)expenses are generally included in the geographic segment in which the expenditures are incurred. operating income for each segment excludes other income and
expense and certain expenses managed outside the operating segments. costs excluded from segment operating income include various corporate expenses, such as manufacturing costs and variances not included in standard costs, research and development,
corporate marketing expenses, stock-based compensation expense, income taxes, various nonrecurring charges, and other separately managed general and administrative costs. the company does not include intercompany transfers between segments for
management reporting purposes. segment assets exclude corporate assets, such as cash, short-term and long-term investments, manufacturing and corporate facilities, miscellaneous corporate infrastructure, goodwill and other acquired intangible
assets. except for the retail segment, capital asset purchases for long-lived assets are not reported to management by segment. cash payments for capital asset purchases by the retail segment were $389 million, $294 million, and $200 million for
2008, 2007, and 2006 respectively.the company has certain retail stores that have been designed and built to serve as high-profile venues to promote brand
awareness and serve as vehicles for corporate sales and marketing activities. because of their unique design elements, locations and size, these stores require substantially more investment than the companys more typical retail stores. the
company allocates certain operating expenses associated with its high-profile stores to corporate marketing expense to reflect the estimated company-wide benefit. the allocation of these operating costs to corporate expense is based on the amount
incurred for a high-profile store in excess of that incurred by a more typical company retail location. the company had opened a total of 11 high-profile stores as of september 27, 2008. expenses allocated to corporate marketing resulting from
the operations of high-profile stores were $53 million, $39 million, and $33 million for the years ended september 27, 2008, september 29, 2007, and september 30, 2006 respectively.83

companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.we conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the public company
accounting oversight board (united states). those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. our
audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed
risk. our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. we believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.a companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for
external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. a companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable
detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding
prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk
that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.in

companys management, including its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.inherent limitations over internal controlsthe companys internal control over financial reporting is designed
to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. the companys internal control over
financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that:management, including the companys chief executive officer and chief financial officer, does not expect
that the companys internal controls will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. a control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are
met. further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no
evaluation of internal controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. also, any evaluation of the effectiveness of controls in future periods are subject to the risk that those
internal controls may become inadequate because of changes in business conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.managements annual report on internal control over financial reportingthe companys management is

# 2015 AAPL

## Item 1A


the company markets certain mobile communication and media devices based on the ios mobile operating system
and also markets related third-party digital content and applications. the company faces substantial competition in these markets from companies that have significant technical, marketing, distribution and other resources, as well as established
hardware, software and digital content supplier relationships; and the company has a minority market share in the global smartphone market. additionally, the company faces significant price competition as competitors reduce their selling prices and
attempt to imitate the companys product features and applications within their own products or, alternatively, collaborate with each other to offer solutions that are more competitive than those they currently offer. the company competes with
business models that include content provided to users for free. the company also competes with illegitimate ways to obtain third-party digital content and applications. some of the companys competitors have greater experience, product breadth
and distribution channels than the company. because some current and potential competitors have substantial resources and/or experience and a lower cost structure, they may be able to provide products and services at little or no profit or even at a
loss. the company also expects competition to intensify as competitors attempt to imitate the companys approach to providing components seamlessly within their individual offerings or work collaboratively to offer integrated solutions. the
companys financial condition and operating results depend substantially on the companys ability to continually improve ios and ios devices in order to maintain their functional and design advantages.the company is the only authorized maker of hardware using os x, which has a minority market share in the personal computer market. this market has been
contracting and is dominated by computer makers using competing operating systems, most notably windows. in the market for personal computers and accessories, the company faces a significant number of competitors, many of which have broader product
lines, lower priced products and a larger installed customer base. historically, consolidation in this market has resulted in larger competitors. price competition has been particularly intense as competitors selling windows-based personal computers
have aggressively cut prices and lowered product margins. an increasing number of internet-enabled devices that include software applications and are smaller and simpler than traditional personal computers compete for market share with the
companys existing products. the companys financial condition and operating results also depend on its ability to continually improve the mac platform to maintain its functional and design advantages.there can be no assurance the company will be able to continue to provide products and services that compete effectively.to remain competitive and stimulate customer demand, the company must successfully manage frequent product introductions and transitions.due to the highly volatile and competitive nature of the industries in which the company competes, the company must continually introduce new
products, services and technologies, enhance existing products and services, effectively stimulate customer demand for new and upgraded products and successfully manage the transition to these new and upgraded products. the success of new product
introductions depends on a number of factors including, but not limited to, timely and successful product development, market acceptance, the companys ability to manage the risks associated with new product production ramp-up issues, the
availability of application software for new products, the effective management of purchase commitments and inventory levels in line with anticipated product demand, the availability of products in appropriate quantities and at expected costs to
meet anticipated demand and the risk that new products may have quality or other defects or deficiencies in the early stages of introduction. accordingly, the company cannot determine in advance the ultimate effect of new product introductions and
transitions.the company depends on the performance of distributors, carriers and other resellers.the company distributes its products through cellular network carriers, wholesalers, national and regional retailers and value-added resellers, many of
whom distribute products from competing manufacturers. the company also sells its products and third-party products in most of its major markets directly to education, enterprise and government customers and consumers and small and mid-sized
businesses through its online and retail stores.carriers providing cellular network service for iphone typically subsidize users purchases of
the device. there is no assurance that such subsidies will be continued at all or in the same amounts upon renewal of the companys agreements with these carriers or in agreements the company enters into with new carriers.apple inc. | 2015 form 10-k | 9



many resellers have narrow operating margins and have been adversely affected in the past by weak economic
conditions. some resellers have perceived the expansion of the companys direct sales as conflicting with their business interests as distributors and resellers of the companys products. such a perception could discourage resellers from
investing resources in the distribution and sale of the companys products or lead them to limit or cease distribution of those products. the company has invested and will continue to invest in programs to enhance reseller sales, including
staffing selected resellers stores with company employees and contractors, and improving product placement displays. these programs could require a substantial investment while providing no assurance of return or incremental revenue. the
financial condition of these resellers could weaken, these resellers could stop distributing the companys products, or uncertainty regarding demand for some or all of the companys products could cause resellers to reduce their ordering
and marketing of the companys products.the company faces substantial inventory and other asset risk in addition to purchase
commitment cancellation risk.the company records a write-down for product and component inventories that have become obsolete or exceed
anticipated demand or net realizable value and accrues necessary cancellation fee reserves for orders of excess products and components. the company also reviews its long-lived assets, including capital assets held at its suppliers facilities
and inventory prepayments, for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. if the company determines that impairment has occurred, it records a write-down equal to the amount by which
the carrying value of the assets exceeds its fair value. although the company believes its provisions related to inventory, capital assets, inventory prepayments and other assets and purchase commitments are currently adequate, no assurance can be
given that the company will not incur additional related charges given the rapid and unpredictable pace of product obsolescence in the industries in which the company competes.the company must order components for its products and build inventory in advance of product announcements and shipments. consistent with industry
practice, components are normally acquired through a combination of purchase orders, supplier contracts and open orders, in each case based on projected demand. where appropriate, the purchases are applied to inventory component
prepayments that are outstanding with the respective supplier. purchase commitments typically cover forecasted component and manufacturing requirements for periods up to 150 days. because the companys markets are volatile,
competitive and subject to rapid technology and price changes, there is a risk the company will forecast incorrectly and order or produce excess or insufficient amounts of components or products, or not fully utilize firm purchase commitments.future operating results depend upon the companys ability to obtain components in sufficient quantities.because the company currently obtains components from single or limited sources, the company is subject to significant supply and pricing risks. many
components, including those that are available from multiple sources, are at times subject to industry-wide shortages and significant commodity pricing fluctuations. while the company has entered into agreements for the supply of many components,
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms, or at all. a number of suppliers of components may suffer from poor financial conditions, which can lead to business failure for the
supplier or consolidation within a particular industry, further limiting the companys ability to obtain sufficient quantities of components. the effects of global or regional economic conditions on the companys suppliers, described
in global and regional economic conditions could materially adversely affect the company above, also could affect the companys ability to obtain components. therefore, the company remains subject to significant risks
of supply shortages and price increases.the company and other participants in the markets for mobile communication and media devices and personal
computers also compete for various components with other industries that have experienced increased demand for their products. the company uses some custom components that are not common to the rest of these industries. the companys new
products often utilize custom components available from only one source. when a component or product uses new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers yields have matured or manufacturing capacity has increased.
continued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at all, may be affected for any number of reasons, including if those suppliers decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet
the companys requirements. the supply of components for a new or existing product could be delayed or constrained, or a key manufacturing vendor could delay shipments of completed products to the company.apple inc. | 2015 form 10-k | 10



the company depends on component and product manufacturing and logistical services provided by
outsourcing partners, many of which are located outside of the u.s.substantially all of the companys manufacturing is performed in
whole or in part by a few outsourcing partners located primarily in asia. the company has also outsourced much of its transportation and logistics management. while these arrangements may lower operating costs, they also reduce the companys
direct control over production and distribution. it is uncertain what effect such diminished control will have on the quality or quantity of products or services, or the companys flexibility to respond to changing conditions. although
arrangements with these partners may contain provisions for warranty expense reimbursement, the company may remain responsible to the consumer for warranty service in the event of product defects and could experience an unanticipated product defect
or warranty liability. while the company relies on its partners to adhere to its supplier code of conduct, material violations of the supplier code of conduct could occur.the company relies on sole-sourced outsourcing partners in the u.s., asia and europe to supply and manufacture many critical components, and on
outsourcing partners primarily located in asia, for final assembly of substantially all of the companys hardware products. any failure of these partners to perform may have a negative impact on the companys cost or supply of components
or finished goods. in addition, manufacturing or logistics in these locations or transit to final destinations may be disrupted for a variety of reasons including, but not limited to, natural and man-made disasters, information technology system
failures, commercial disputes, military actions or economic, business, labor, environmental, public health, or political issues.the company has
invested in manufacturing process equipment, much of which is held at certain of its outsourcing partners, and has made prepayments to certain of its suppliers associated with long-term supply agreements. while these arrangements help ensure the
supply of components and finished goods, if these outsourcing partners or suppliers experience severe financial problems or other disruptions in their business, such continued supply could be reduced or terminated and the net realizable value of
these assets could be negatively impacted.the companys products and services may experience quality problems from time to time
that can result in decreased sales and operating margin and harm to the companys reputation.the company sells complex hardware and
software products and services that can contain design and manufacturing defects. sophisticated operating system software and applications, such as those sold by the company, often contain bugs that can unexpectedly interfere with the
softwares intended operation. the companys online services may from time to time experience outages, service slowdowns, or errors. defects may also occur in components and products the company purchases from third parties. there can be
no assurance the company will be able to detect and fix all defects in the hardware, software and services it sells. failure to do so could result in lost revenue, significant warranty and other expenses and harm to the companys reputation.the company relies on access to third-party digital content, which may not be available to the company on commercially reasonable terms
or at all.the company contracts with numerous third parties to offer their digital content. this includes the right to sell currently
available music, movies, tv shows and books. the licensing or other distribution arrangements with these third parties are for relatively short terms and do not guarantee the continuation or renewal of these arrangements on reasonable terms, if at
all. some third-party content providers and distributors currently or in the future may offer competing products and services, and could take action to make it more difficult or impossible for the company to license or otherwise distribute their
content in the future. other content owners, providers or distributors may seek to limit the companys access to, or increase the cost of, such content. the company may be unable to continue to offer a wide variety of content at reasonable
prices with acceptable usage rules, or continue to expand its geographic reach. failure to obtain the right to make available third-party digital content, or to make available such content on commercially reasonable terms, could have a material
adverse impact on the companys financial condition and operating results.some third-party digital content providers require the company to
provide digital rights management and other security solutions. if requirements change, the company may have to develop or license new technology to provide these solutions. there is no assurance the company will be able to develop or license such
solutions at a reasonable cost and in a timely manner. in addition, certain countries have passed or may propose and adopt legislation that would force the company to license its digital rights management, which could lessen the protection of
content and subject it to piracy and also could negatively affect arrangements with the companys content providers.apple inc. | 2015 form 10-k | 11



the companys future performance depends in part on support from third-party software developers.the company believes decisions by customers to purchase its hardware
products depend in part on the availability of third-party software applications and services. there is no assurance that third-party developers will continue to develop and maintain software applications and
services for the companys products. if third-party software applications and services cease to be developed and maintained for the companys products, customers may choose not to buy the companys products.with respect to its mac products, the company believes the availability of third-party software applications and
services depends in part on the developers perception and analysis of the relative benefits of developing, maintaining and upgrading such software for the companys products compared to windows-based products. this analysis may be based
on factors such as the market position of the company and its products, the anticipated revenue that may be generated, expected future growth of mac sales and the costs of developing such applications and services. if the companys minority
share of the global personal computer market causes developers to question the macs prospects, developers could be less inclined to develop or upgrade software for the companys mac products and more inclined to devote their resources to
developing and upgrading software for the larger windows market.with respect to ios devices, the company relies on the continued availability and
development of compelling and innovative software applications, which are distributed through a single distribution channel, the app store. ios devices are subject to rapid technological change, and, if third-party developers are unable to or choose
not to keep up with this pace of change, third-party applications might not successfully operate and may result in dissatisfied customers. as with applications for the companys mac products, the availability and development of these
applications also depend on developers perceptions and analysis of the relative benefits of developing, maintaining or upgrading software for the companys ios devices rather than its competitors platforms, such as android. if
developers focus their efforts on these competing platforms, the availability and quality of applications for the companys ios devices may suffer.the company relies on access to third-party intellectual property, which may not be available to the company on commercially reasonable
terms or at all.many of the companys products include third-party intellectual property, which requires licenses from those third
parties. based on past experience and industry practice, the company believes such licenses generally can be obtained on reasonable terms. there is, however, no assurance that the necessary licenses can be obtained on acceptable terms or at all.
failure to obtain the right to use third-party intellectual property, or to use such intellectual property on commercially reasonable terms, could preclude the company from selling certain products or otherwise have a material adverse impact on the
companys financial condition and operating results.the company could be impacted by unfavorable results of legal proceedings,
such as being found to have infringed on intellectual property rights.the company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that
have not yet been fully resolved and that have arisen in the ordinary course of business, and additional claims may arise in the future.for
example, technology companies, including many of the companys competitors, frequently enter into litigation based on allegations of patent infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. in addition, patent holding companies
seek to monetize patents they have purchased or otherwise obtained. as the company has grown, the intellectual property rights claims against it have increased and may continue to increase. in particular, the companys cellular enabled products
compete with products from mobile communication and media device companies that hold significant patent portfolios, and the number of patent claims against the company has significantly increased. the company is vigorously defending
infringement actions in courts in a number of u.s. jurisdictions and before the u.s. international trade commission, as well as internationally in various countries. the plaintiffs in these actions frequently seek injunctions and substantial
damages.regardless of the scope or validity of such patents or other intellectual property rights, or the merits of any claims by potential or
actual litigants, the company may have to engage in protracted litigation. if the company is found to infringe one or more patents or other intellectual property rights, regardless of whether it can develop non-infringing technology, it may be
required to pay substantial damages or royalties to a third-party, or it may be subject to a temporary or permanent injunction prohibiting the company from marketing or selling certain products.in certain cases, the company may consider the desirability of entering into licensing agreements, although no assurance can be given that such licenses
can be obtained on acceptable terms or that litigation will not occur. these licenses may also significantly increase the companys operating expenses.apple inc. | 2015 form 10-k | 12



regardless of the merit of particular claims, litigation may be expensive, time-consuming, disruptive to the
companys operations and distracting to management. in recognition of these considerations, the company may enter into arrangements to settle litigation.in managements opinion, there is not at least a reasonable possibility the company may have incurred a material loss, or a material loss in excess
of a recorded accrual, with respect to loss contingencies, including matters related to infringement of intellectual property rights. however, the outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain.although management considers the likelihood of such an outcome to be remote, if one or more legal matters were resolved against the company in a
reporting period for amounts in excess of managements expectations, the companys consolidated financial statements for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected. further, such an outcome could result in significant
compensatory, punitive or trebled monetary damages, disgorgement of revenue or profits, remedial corporate measures or injunctive relief against the company that could materially adversely affect its financial condition and operating results.the company is subject to laws and regulations worldwide, changes to which could increase the companys costs and individually or in
the aggregate adversely affect the companys business.the company is subject to laws and regulations affecting its domestic and
international operations in a number of areas. these u.s. and foreign laws and regulations affect the companys activities including, but not limited to, in areas of labor, advertising, digital content, consumer protection, real estate,
billing, e-commerce, promotions, quality of services, telecommunications, mobile communications and media, television, intellectual property ownership and infringement, tax, import and export requirements, anti-corruption, foreign exchange controls
and cash repatriation restrictions, data privacy requirements, anti-competition, environmental, health and safety.by way of example, laws and
regulations related to mobile communications and media devices in the many jurisdictions in which the company operates are extensive and subject to change. such changes could include, among others, restrictions on the production, manufacture,
distribution and use of devices, locking devices to a carriers network, or mandating the use of devices on more than one carriers network. these devices are also subject to certification and regulation by governmental and standardization
bodies, as well as by cellular network carriers for use on their networks. these certification processes are extensive and time consuming, and could result in additional testing requirements, product modifications, or delays in product shipment
dates, or could preclude the company from selling certain products.compliance with these laws, regulations and similar requirements may be onerous
and expensive, and they may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, further increasing the cost of compliance and doing business. any such costs, which may rise in the future as a result of changes in these laws and regulations or in
their interpretation, could individually or in the aggregate make the companys products and services less attractive to the companys customers, delay the introduction of new products in one or more regions, or cause the company to change
or limit its business practices. the company has implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations, but there can be no assurance that the companys employees, contractors, or agents will not
violate such laws and regulations or the companys policies and procedures.the companys business is subject to the risks of
international operations.the company derives a significant portion of its revenue and earnings from its international operations. compliance
with applicable u.s. and foreign laws and regulations, such as import and export requirements, anti-corruption laws, tax laws, foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions, data privacy requirements, environmental laws, labor laws
and anti-competition regulations, increases the costs of doing business in foreign jurisdictions. although the company has implemented policies and procedures to comply with these laws and regulations, a violation by the companys employees,
contractors, or agents could nevertheless occur. violations of these laws and regulations could materially adversely affect the companys brand, international growth efforts and business.the company also could be significantly affected by other risks associated with international activities including, but not limited to, economic and
labor conditions, increased duties, taxes and other costs and political instability. margins on sales of the companys products in foreign countries, and on sales of products that include components obtained from foreign suppliers, could be
materially adversely affected by international trade regulations, including duties, tariffs and antidumping penalties. the company is also exposed to credit and collectability risk on its trade receivables with customers in certain international
markets. there can be no assurance the company can effectively limit its credit risk and avoid losses.apple inc. | 2015 form 10-k | 13



the companys retail stores have required and will continue to require a substantial
investment and commitment of resources and are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties.the companys retail stores have required
substantial investment in equipment and leasehold improvements, information systems, inventory and personnel. the company also has entered into substantial operating lease commitments for retail space. certain stores have been designed and built to
serve as high-profile venues to promote brand awareness and serve as vehicles for corporate sales and marketing activities. because of their unique design elements, locations and size, these stores require substantially more investment than the
companys more typical retail stores. due to the high cost structure associated with the companys retail stores, a decline in sales or the closure or poor performance of individual or multiple stores could result in significant lease
termination costs, write-offs of equipment and leasehold improvements and severance costs.many factors unique to retail operations, some of which
are beyond the companys control, pose risks and uncertainties. these risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, macro-economic factors that could have an adverse effect on general retail activity, as well as the companys
inability to manage costs associated with store construction and operation, the companys failure to manage relationships with its existing retail partners, more challenging environments in managing retail operations outside the u.s., costs
associated with unanticipated fluctuations in the value of retail inventory, and the companys inability to obtain and renew leases in quality retail locations at a reasonable cost.investment in new business strategies and acquisitions could disrupt the companys ongoing business and present risks not originally
contemplated.the company has invested, and in the future may invest, in new business strategies or acquisitions. such endeavors may involve
significant risks and uncertainties, including distraction of management from current operations, greater than expected liabilities and expenses, inadequate return of capital and unidentified issues not discovered in the companys due
diligence. these new ventures are inherently risky and may not be successful.the companys business and reputation may be
impacted by information technology system failures or network disruptions.the company may be subject to information technology system
failures and network disruptions. these may be caused by natural disasters, accidents, power disruptions, telecommunications failures, acts of terrorism or war, computer viruses, physical or electronic break-ins, or other events or disruptions.
system redundancy may be ineffective or inadequate, and the companys disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities. such failures or disruptions could, among other things, prevent access to the companys online
stores and services, preclude retail store transactions, compromise company or customer data, and result in delayed or cancelled orders. system failures and disruptions could also impede the manufacturing and shipping of products, delivery of online
services, transactions processing and financial reporting.there may be breaches of the companys information technology systems
that materially damage business partner and customer relationships, curtail or otherwise adversely impact access to online stores and services, or subject the company to significant reputational, financial, legal and operational consequences.the companys business requires it to use and store customer, employee and business partner personally identifiable information
(pii). this may include, among other information, names, addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, contact preferences, tax identification numbers and payment account information. although malicious attacks to gain access to pii affect
many companies across various industries, the company is at a relatively greater risk of being targeted because of its high profile and the amount of pii it manages.the company requires user names and passwords in order to access its information technology systems. the company also uses encryption and authentication
technologies designed to secure the transmission and storage of data and prevent access to company data or accounts. as with all companies, these security measures are subject to third-party security breaches, employee error, malfeasance, faulty
password management, or other irregularities. for example, third parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees or customers into disclosing user names, passwords or other sensitive information, which may in turn be used to access the
companys information technology systems. to help protect customers and the company, the company monitors accounts and systems for unusual activity and may freeze accounts under suspicious circumstances, which may result in the delay or loss of
customer orders.apple inc. | 2015 form 10-k | 14



the company devotes significant resources to network security, data encryption and other security measures
to protect its systems and data, but these security measures cannot provide absolute security. to the extent the company was to experience a breach of its systems and was unable to protect sensitive data, such a breach could materially damage
business partner and customer relationships, and curtail or otherwise adversely impact access to online stores and services. moreover, if a computer security breach affects the companys systems or results in the unauthorized release of pii,
the companys reputation and brand could be materially damaged, use of the companys products and services could decrease, and the company could be exposed to a risk of loss or litigation and possible liability. while the company maintains
insurance coverage that, subject to policy terms and conditions and subject to a significant self-insured retention, is designed to address certain aspects of cyber risks, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types
of claims that may arise in the continually evolving area of cyber risk.the companys business is subject to a variety of u.s.
and international laws, rules, policies and other obligations regarding data protection.the company is subject to federal, state and
international laws relating to the collection, use, retention, security and transfer of pii. in many cases, these laws apply not only to third-party transactions, but also to transfers of information between the company and its subsidiaries, and
among the company, its subsidiaries and other parties with which the company has commercial relations. several jurisdictions have passed laws in this area, and other jurisdictions are considering imposing additional restrictions. these laws continue
to develop and may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. complying with emerging and changing international requirements may cause the company to incur substantial costs or require the company to change its business practices.
noncompliance could result in penalties or significant legal liability.the companys privacy policy, which includes related practices
concerning the use and disclosure of data, is posted on its website. any failure by the company, its suppliers or other parties with whom the company does business to comply with its posted privacy policy or with other federal, state or
international privacy-related or data protection laws and regulations could result in proceedings against the company by governmental entities or others.the company is also subject to payment card association rules and obligations under its contracts with payment card processors. under these rules and
obligations, if information is compromised, the company could be liable to payment card issuers for associated expenses and penalties. in addition, if the company fails to follow payment card industry security standards, even if no customer
information is compromised, the company could incur significant fines or experience a significant increase in payment card transaction costs.the companys success depends largely on the continued service and availability of key personnel.much of the companys future success depends on the continued availability and service of key personnel, including its chief executive officer,
executive team and other highly skilled employees. experienced personnel in the technology industry are in high demand and competition for their talents is intense, especially in silicon valley, where most of the companys key personnel are
located.the companys business may be impacted by political events, war, terrorism, public health issues, natural disasters and
other business interruptions.war, terrorism, geopolitical uncertainties, public health issues and other business interruptions have caused
and could cause damage or disruption to international commerce and the global economy, and thus could have a material adverse effect on the company, its suppliers, logistics providers, manufacturing vendors and customers, including channel partners.
the companys business operations are subject to interruption by, among others, natural disasters, whether as a result of climate change or otherwise, fire, power shortages, nuclear power plant accidents, terrorist attacks and other hostile
acts, labor disputes, public health issues and other events beyond its control. such events could decrease demand for the companys products, make it difficult or impossible for the company to make and deliver products to its customers,
including channel partners, or to receive components from its suppliers, and create delays and inefficiencies in the companys supply chain. should major public health issues, including pandemics, arise, the company could be adversely affected
by more stringent employee travel restrictions, additional limitations in freight services, governmental actions limiting the movement of products between regions, delays in production ramps of new products and disruptions in the operations of the
companys manufacturing vendors and component suppliers. the majority of the companys r&d activities, its corporate headquarters, information technology systems and other critical business operations, including certain component
suppliers and manufacturing vendors, are in locations that could be affected by natural disasters. in the event of a natural disaster, the company could incur significant losses, require substantial recovery time and experience significant
expenditures in order to resume operations.apple inc. | 2015 form 10-k | 15



the company expects its quarterly revenue and operating results to fluctuate.the companys profit margins vary across its products and distribution channels. the companys software, accessories, and service and support
contracts generally have higher gross margins than certain of the companys other products. gross margins on the companys hardware products vary across product lines and can change over time as a result of product transitions, pricing and
configuration changes, and component, warranty, and other cost fluctuations. the companys direct sales generally have higher associated gross margins than its indirect sales through its channel partners. in addition, the companys gross
margin and operating margin percentages, as well as overall profitability, may be materially adversely impacted as a result of a shift in product, geographic or channel mix, component cost increases, the strengthening u.s. dollar, price competition,
or the introduction of new products, including those that have higher cost structures with flat or reduced pricing.the company has typically
experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters due in part to seasonal holiday demand. additionally, new product introductions can significantly impact net sales, product costs and operating expenses. further, the
company generates a majority of its net sales from a single product and a decline in demand for that product could significantly impact quarterly net sales. the company could also be subject to unexpected developments late in a quarter, such as
lower-than-anticipated demand for the companys products, issues with new product introductions, an internal systems failure, or failure of one of the companys logistics, components supply, or manufacturing partners.the companys stock price is subject to volatility.the companys stock price has experienced substantial price volatility in the past and may continue to do so in the future. additionally, the
company, the technology industry and the stock market as a whole have experienced extreme stock price and volume fluctuations that have affected stock prices in ways that may have been unrelated to these companies operating performance. price
volatility over a given period may cause the average price at which the company repurchases its own stock to exceed the stocks price at a given point in time. the company believes its stock price should reflect expectations of future growth
and profitability. the company also believes its stock price should reflect expectations that its cash dividend will continue at current levels or grow and that its current share repurchase program will be fully consummated. future dividends are
subject to declaration by the companys board of directors, and the companys share repurchase program does not obligate it to acquire any specific number of shares. if the company fails to meet expectations related to future growth,
profitability, dividends, share repurchases or other market expectations, its stock price may decline significantly, which could have a material adverse impact on investor confidence and employee retention.the companys financial performance is subject to risks associated with changes in the value of the u.s. dollar versus local
currencies.the companys primary exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates relates to non-u.s. dollar-denominated sales
and operating expenses worldwide. weakening of foreign currencies relative to the u.s. dollar adversely affects the u.s. dollar value of the companys foreign currency-denominated sales and earnings, and generally leads the company to raise
international pricing, potentially reducing demand for the companys products. margins on sales of the companys products in foreign countries and on sales of products that include components obtained from foreign suppliers, could be
materially adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. in some circumstances, for competitive or other reasons, the company may decide not to raise local prices to fully offset the dollars strengthening, or at all, which
would adversely affect the u.s. dollar value of the companys foreign currency-denominated sales and earnings. conversely, a strengthening of foreign currencies relative to the u.s. dollar, while generally beneficial to the companys
foreign currency-denominated sales and earnings, could cause the company to reduce international pricing and incur losses on its foreign currency derivative instruments, thereby limiting the benefit. additionally, strengthening of foreign currencies
may also increase the companys cost of product components denominated in those currencies, thus adversely affecting gross margins.the company
uses derivative instruments, such as foreign currency forward and option contracts, to hedge certain exposures to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. the use of such hedging activities may not offset any, or more than a portion, of the
adverse financial effects of unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates over the limited time the hedges are in place.the company
is exposed to credit risk and fluctuations in the market values of its investment portfolio.given the global nature of its business, the
company has both domestic and international investments. credit ratings and pricing of the companys investments can be negatively affected by liquidity, credit deterioration, financial results, economic risk, political risk, sovereign risk or
other factors. as a result, the value and liquidity of the companys cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities may fluctuate substantially. therefore, although the company has not realized any significant losses on its cash, cash
equivalents and marketable securities, future fluctuations in their value could result in a significant realized loss.apple inc. | 2015 form 10-k | 16



the company is exposed to credit risk on its trade accounts receivable, vendor non-trade
receivables and prepayments related to long-term supply agreements, and this risk is heightened during periods when economic conditions worsen.the company distributes its products through third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers and value-added resellers. the company also
sells its products directly to small and mid-sized businesses and education, enterprise and government customers. a substantial majority of the companys outstanding trade receivables are not covered by collateral, third-party financing
arrangements or credit insurance. the companys exposure to credit and collectability risk on its trade receivables is higher in certain international markets and its ability to mitigate such risks may be limited. the company also has unsecured
vendor non-trade receivables resulting from purchases of components by outsourcing partners and other vendors that manufacture sub-assemblies or assemble final products for the company. in addition, the company has made prepayments associated with
long-term supply agreements to secure supply of inventory components. as of september 26, 2015, a significant portion of the companys trade receivables was concentrated within cellular network carriers, and its vendor non-trade
receivables and prepayments related to long-term supply agreements were concentrated among a few individual vendors located primarily in asia. while the company has procedures to monitor and limit exposure to credit risk on its trade and vendor
non-trade receivables, as well as long-term prepayments, there can be no assurance such procedures will effectively limit its credit risk and avoid losses.the company could be subject to changes in its tax rates, the adoption of new u.s. or international tax legislation or exposure to
additional tax liabilities.the company is subject to taxes in the u.s. and numerous foreign jurisdictions, including ireland, where a number
of the companys subsidiaries are organized. due to economic and political conditions, tax rates in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change. the companys effective tax rates could be affected by changes in the mix of
earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, or changes in tax laws or their interpretation, including in the u.s. and ireland. for example, in june 2014, the european
commission opened a formal investigation of ireland to examine whether decisions by the tax authorities with regard to the corporate income tax to be paid by two of the companys irish subsidiaries comply with european union rules on state aid.
if the european commission were to conclude against ireland, it could require ireland to recover from the company past taxes covering a period of up to 10 years reflective of the disallowed state aid, and such amount could be material.the company is also subject to the examination of its tax returns and other tax matters by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities and
governmental bodies. the company regularly assesses the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of its provision for taxes. there can be no assurance as to the outcome of these examinations. if
the companys effective tax rates were to increase, particularly in the u.s. or ireland, or if the ultimate determination of the companys taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued, the companys financial
condition, operating results and cash flows could be adversely affected.apple inc. | 2015 form 10-k | 17

6 and 6 plus during 2015. overall average selling prices (asps) for iphone increased by 11% during 2015 compared to 2014, due primarily to the introduction of iphone 6 and 6 plus in september 2014, partially offset by the effect of
weakness in most foreign currencies relative to the u.s. dollar.the year-over-year growth in iphone net sales and unit sales in 2014 resulted
primarily from the successful introduction of new iphones in the latter half of calendar year 2013, the successful launch of iphone 6 and 6 plus beginning in september 2014, and expanded distribution. iphone unit sales grew in all of the

net sales from internet services was driven by increases in revenue from app sales reflecting continued growth in the installed base of ios devices and the expanded offerings of ios apps and related in-app purchases. this was partially offset by a
decline in sales of digital music.segment operating performancethe company manages its business primarily on a geographic basis. the companys reportable operating segments consist of the americas, europe,

gross margingross margin for 2015, 2014 and 2013 is as follows (dollars in millions):net salescost of salesgross margingross margin percentagethe year-over-year increase in the gross margin percentage in 2015 was driven primarily by a favorable shift in mix to
products with higher margins and, to a lesser extent, by improved leverage on fixed costs from higher net sales. these positive factors were partially offset primarily by higher product cost structures and, to a lesser extent, by the effect of
weakness in most foreign currencies relative to the u.s. dollar.the year-over-year increase in the gross margin percentage in 2014 was driven by
multiple factors including lower commodity costs, a favorable shift in mix to products with higher margins and improved leverage on fixed costs from higher net sales, which was partially offset by the weakness in several foreign currencies relative
to the u.s. dollar, price reductions on select products and higher cost structures on certain new products.the company anticipates gross margin
during the first quarter of 2016 to be between 39% and 40%. the foregoing statement regarding the companys expected gross margin percentage in the first quarter of 2016 is forward-looking and could differ from actual results. the
companys future gross margins can be impacted by multiple factors including, but not limited to, those set forth in part i, item 1a of this form 10-k under the heading risk factors and those described in this paragraph. in
general, the company believes gross margins will remain under downward pressure due to a variety of factors, including continued industry wide global product pricing pressures, increased competition, compressed product life cycles, product
transitions, potential increases in the cost of components, and potential strengthening of the u.s. dollar, as well as potential increases in the costs of outside manufacturing services and a potential shift in the companys sales mix towards
products with lower gross margins. in response to competitive pressures, the company expects it will continue to take product pricing actions, which would adversely affect gross margins. gross margins could also be affected by the companys
ability to manage product quality and warranty costs effectively and to stimulate demand for certain of its products. due to the companys significant international operations, its financial condition and operating results, including gross
margins, could be significantly affected by fluctuations in exchange rates.operating expensesoperating expenses for 2015, 2014 and 2013 are as follows (dollars in millions):research and developmentpercentage of total net salesselling, general and administrativepercentage of total net salestotal operating expensespercentage of total net salesresearch and developmentthe
year-over-year growth in r&d expense in 2015 and 2014 was driven primarily by an increase in headcount and related expenses, including share-based compensation costs, and material costs to support expanded r&d activities. the company
continues to believe that focused investments in r&d are critical to its future growth and competitive position in the marketplace and are directly related to timely development of new and updated products that are central to the companys
core business strategy.selling, general and administrativethe year-over-year growth in selling, general and administrative expense in 2015 and 2014 was primarily due to increased headcount and related expenses,

the u.s. the higher effective tax rate during 2015 compared to 2014 was due primarily to higher foreign taxes. the effective tax rate in 2014 compared to 2013 was relatively flat.as of september 26, 2015, the company had deferred tax assets arising from deductible temporary differences, tax losses and tax credits of $7.8
billion and deferred tax liabilities of $24.1 billion. management believes it is more likely than not that forecasted income, including income that may be generated as a result of certain tax planning strategies, together with future reversals of
existing taxable temporary differences, will be sufficient to fully recover the deferred tax assets. the company will continue to evaluate the realizability of deferred tax assets quarterly by assessing the need for and the amount of a valuation
allowance.the u.s. internal revenue service is currently examining the years 2010 through 2012, and all years prior to 2010 are closed. in
addition, the company is subject to audits by state, local and foreign tax authorities. in major states and major foreign jurisdictions, the years subsequent to 2003 generally remain open and could be subject to examination by the taxing
authorities. management believes that adequate provisions have been made for any adjustments that may result from tax examinations. however, the outcome of tax audits cannot be predicted with certainty. if any issues addressed in the companys
tax audits are resolved in a manner not consistent with managements expectations, the company could be required to adjust its provision for income taxes in the period such resolution occurs.on june 11, 2014, the european commission issued an opening decision initiating a formal investigation against ireland for alleged state aid to the
company. the opening decision concerns the allocation of profits for taxation purposes of the irish branches of two subsidiaries of the company. the company believes the european commissions assertions are without merit. if the european
commission were to conclude against ireland, the european commission could require ireland to recover from the company past taxes covering a period of up to 10 years reflective of the disallowed state aid. while such amount could be material, as of
september 26, 2015 the company is unable to estimate the impact.apple inc. | 2015 form 10-k | 29

from contracts with customers (topic 606) (asu 2014-09), which amends the existing accounting standards for revenue recognition. asu 2014-09 is based on principles that govern the recognition of revenue at an amount an entity expects to
be entitled when products are transferred to customers.the original effective date for asu 2014-09 would have required the company to adopt
beginning in its first quarter of 2018. in august 2015, the fasb issued asu no. 2015-14, revenue from contracts with customers (topic 606)  deferral of the effective date, which defers the effective date of asu 2014-09 for one year and
permits early adoption as early as the original effective date of asu 2014-09. accordingly, the company may adopt the standard in either its first quarter of 2018 or 2019. the new revenue standard may be applied retrospectively to each prior period
presented or retrospectively with the cumulative effect recognized as of the date of adoption. the company is currently evaluating the timing of its adoption and the impact of adopting the new revenue standard on its consolidated financial

off-balance sheet arrangements and contractual obligationsthe company has not entered into any transactions with unconsolidated entities whereby the company has financial guarantees, subordinated retained
interests, derivative instruments, or other contingent arrangements that expose the company to material continuing risks, contingent liabilities, or any other obligation under a variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing,
liquidity, market risk, or credit risk support to the company, or engages in leasing, hedging, or r&d services with the company.the following
table presents certain payments due by the company under contractual obligations with minimum firm commitments as of september 26, 2015, and excludes amounts already recorded on the consolidated balance sheet, except for term debt (in
millions):term debtoperating leasespurchase commitmentsother obligationstotaloperating leasesthe
companys major facility leases are typically for terms not exceeding 10 years and generally contain multi-year renewal options. as of september 26, 2015, the company had a total of 463 retail stores. leases for retail space are for terms
ranging from five to 20 years, the majority of which are for 10 years, and often contain multi-year renewal options. as of september 26, 2015, the companys total future minimum lease payments under noncancelable operating leases were $6.3
billion, of which $3.6 billion related to leases for retail space.purchase commitmentsthe company utilizes several outsourcing partners to manufacture sub-assemblies for the companys products and to perform final assembly and testing
of finished products. these outsourcing partners acquire components and build product based on demand information supplied by the company, which typically covers periods up to 150 days. the company also obtains individual components for its products
from a wide variety of individual suppliers. consistent with industry practice, the company acquires components through a combination of purchase orders, supplier contracts, and open orders based on projected demand information. where
appropriate, the purchases are applied to inventory component prepayments that are outstanding with the respective supplier. as of september 26, 2015, the company had outstanding off-balance sheet third-party
manufacturing commitments and component purchase commitments of $29.5 billion.other obligationsthe companys other off-balance sheet obligations were comprised of commitments to acquire capital assets, including product tooling and
manufacturing process equipment, and commitments related to inventory prepayments, advertising, licensing, r&d, internet and telecommunications services, energy and other obligations.the companys other non-current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets consist primarily of deferred tax liabilities, gross unrecognized tax
benefits and the related gross interest and penalties. as of september 26, 2015, the company had non-current deferred tax liabilities of $24.1 billion. additionally, as of september 26, 2015, the company had gross unrecognized tax benefits
of $6.9 billion and an additional $1.3 billion for gross interest and penalties classified as non-current liabilities. at this time, the company is unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments in individual years in
connection with these tax liabilities; therefore, such amounts are not included in the above contractual obligation table.indemnificationthe company generally does not indemnify end-users of its operating system and application software against legal claims that the software infringes
third-party intellectual property rights. other agreements entered into by the company sometimes include indemnification provisions under which the company could be subject to costs and/or damages in the event of an infringement claim against the
company or an indemnified third-party. in the opinion of management, there was not at least a reasonable possibility the company may have incurred a material loss with respect to indemnification of end-users of its operating system or application
software for infringement of third-party intellectual property rights. the company did not record a liability for infringement costs related to indemnification as of september 26, 2015 or september 27, 2014.apple inc. | 2015 form 10-k | 32



in september 2015, the company introduced the iphone upgrade program, which is available to customers who
purchase an iphone 6s and 6s plus in one of its u.s. physical retail stores and activate the purchased iphone with one of the four national carriers. the iphone upgrade program provides customers the right to trade in that iphone for a new iphone,
provided certain conditions are met. one of the conditions of this program requires the customer to finance the initial purchase price of the iphone with a third-party lender. upon exercise of the trade-in right and purchase of a new iphone, the
company satisfies the customers outstanding balance due to the third-party lender on the original device. the company accounts for the trade-in right as a guarantee liability and recognizes arrangement revenue net of the fair value of such
right with subsequent changes to the guarantee liability recognized within revenue.the company has entered into indemnification agreements with its
directors and executive officers. under these agreements, the company has agreed to indemnify such individuals to the fullest extent permitted by law against liabilities that arise by reason of their status as directors or officers and to advance
expenses incurred by such individuals in connection with related legal proceedings. it is not possible to determine the maximum potential amount of payments the company could be required to make under these agreements due to the limited history of
prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each claim. however, the company maintains directors and officers liability insurance coverage to reduce its exposure to such obligations.critical accounting policies and estimatesthe preparation of
financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles (gaap) and the companys discussion and analysis of its financial condition and operating results require the
companys management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported in its consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. note 1, summary of significant accounting policies, of the notes to
consolidated financial statements in part ii, item 8 of this form 10-k describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the companys consolidated financial statements. management bases its estimates on
historical experience and on various other assumptions it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. actual results may differ from
these estimates, and such differences may be material.management believes the companys critical accounting policies and estimates are those
related to revenue recognition, valuation and impairment of marketable securities, inventory valuation and valuation of manufacturing-related assets and estimated purchase commitment cancellation fees, warranty costs, income taxes, and legal and
other contingencies. management considers these policies critical because they are both important to the portrayal of the companys financial condition and operating results, and they require management to make judgments and estimates about
inherently uncertain matters. the companys senior management has reviewed these critical accounting policies and related disclosures with the audit and finance committee of the companys board of directors.revenue recognitionnet sales consist primarily of revenue
from the sale of hardware, software, digital content and applications, accessories, and service and support contracts. the company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the sales price is fixed
or determinable and collection is probable. product is considered delivered to the customer once it has been shipped and title, risk of loss and rewards of ownership have been transferred. for most of the companys product sales, these criteria
are met at the time the product is shipped. for online sales to individuals, for some sales to education customers in the u.s., and for certain other sales, the company defers revenue until the customer receives the product because the company
retains a portion of the risk of loss on these sales during transit. for payment terms in excess of the companys standard payment terms, revenue is recognized as payments become due unless the company has positive evidence that the sales price
is fixed or determinable, such as a successful history of collection, without concession, on comparable arrangements. the company recognizes revenue from the sale of hardware products, software bundled with hardware that is essential to the
functionality of the hardware and third-party digital content sold on the itunes store in accordance with general revenue recognition accounting guidance. the company recognizes revenue in accordance with industry-specific software accounting
guidance for the following types of sales transactions: (i) standalone sales of software products, (ii) sales of software upgrades and (iii) sales of software bundled with hardware not essential to the functionality of the hardware.for multi-element arrangements that include hardware products containing software essential to the hardware products functionality,
undelivered software elements that relate to the hardware products essential software and/or undelivered non-software services, the company allocates revenue to all deliverables based on their relative selling prices. in such circumstances,
the company uses a hierarchy to determine the selling price to be used for allocating revenue to deliverables: (i) vendor-specific objective evidence of fair value (vsoe), (ii) third-party evidence of selling price
(tpe) and (iii) best estimate of selling price (esp). vsoe generally exists only when the company sells the deliverable separately and is the price actually charged by the company for that deliverable. esps reflect the
companys best estimates of what the selling prices of elements would be if they were sold regularly on a stand-alone basis.apple inc. | 2015 form 10-k | 33



for sales of qualifying versions of ios devices, mac, apple watch and apple tv, the company has indicated it
may from time to time provide future unspecified software upgrades to the devices essential software and/or non-software services free of charge. because the company has neither vsoe nor tpe for the unspecified software upgrade rights or the
non-software services, revenue is allocated to these rights and services based on the companys esps. revenue allocated to the unspecified software upgrade rights and non-software services based on the companys esps is deferred and
recognized on a straight-line basis over the estimated period the software upgrades and non-software services are expected to be provided.the
companys process for determining esps involves managements judgment and considers multiple factors that may vary over time depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each deliverable. should future facts and
circumstances change, the companys esps and the future rate of related amortization for unspecified software upgrades and non-software services related to future sales of these devices could change. factors subject to change include the
unspecified software upgrade rights and non-software services offered, the estimated value of unspecified software upgrade rights and non-software services and the estimated period unspecified software upgrades and non-software services are expected
to be provided.the company records reductions to revenue for estimated commitments related to price protection and other customer incentive
programs. for transactions involving price protection, the company recognizes revenue net of the estimated amount to be refunded, provided the refund amount can be reasonably and reliably estimated and the other conditions for revenue recognition
have been met. the companys policy requires that, if refunds cannot be reliably estimated, revenue is not recognized until reliable estimates can be made or the price protection lapses. for the companys other customer incentive programs,
the estimated cost is recognized at the later of the date at which the company has sold the product or the date at which the program is offered. the company also records reductions to revenue for expected future product returns based on the
companys historical experience. future market conditions and product transitions may require the company to increase customer incentive programs that could result in reductions to future revenue. additionally, certain customer incentive
programs require management to estimate the number of customers who will actually redeem the incentive. managements estimates are based on historical experience and the specific terms and conditions of particular incentive programs. if a
greater than estimated proportion of customers redeems such incentives, the company would be required to record additional reductions to revenue, which would have an adverse impact on the companys operating results.valuation and impairment of marketable securitiesthe
companys investments in available-for-sale securities are reported at fair value. unrealized gains and losses related to changes in the fair value of securities are recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income, net of tax, in the
companys consolidated balance sheets. changes in the fair value of available-for-sale securities impact the companys net income only when such securities are sold or an other-than-temporary impairment is recognized. realized gains and
losses on the sale of securities are determined by specific identification of each securitys cost basis. the company regularly reviews its investment portfolio to determine if any security is other-than-temporarily impaired, which would
require the company to record an impairment charge in the period any such determination is made. in making this judgment, the company evaluates, among other things, the duration and extent to which the fair value of a security is less than its cost;
the financial condition of the issuer and any changes thereto; and the companys intent to sell, or whether it will more likely than not be required to sell, the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis. the companys
assessment on whether a security is other-than-temporarily impaired could change in the future due to new developments or changes in assumptions related to any particular security, which would have an adverse impact on the companys operating
results.inventory valuation and valuation of manufacturing-related assets and estimated purchase commitment cancellation feesthe company must purchase components and build inventory in advance of product shipments and has invested in manufacturing-related assets, including
capital assets held at its suppliers facilities. in addition, the company has made prepayments to certain of its suppliers associated with long-term supply agreements to secure supply of inventory components. the company records a write-down
for inventories of components and products, including third-party products held for resale, which have become obsolete or are in excess of anticipated demand or net realizable value. the company performs a detailed review of inventory that considers
multiple factors including demand forecasts, product life cycle status, product development plans, current sales levels and component cost trends. the company also reviews its manufacturing-related capital assets and inventory prepayments for
impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. if the company determines that an asset is not recoverable, it records an impairment loss equal to the amount by which the carrying value
of such an asset exceeds its fair value.the industries in which the company competes are subject to a rapid and unpredictable pace of product and
component obsolescence and demand changes. in certain circumstances the company may be required to record additional write-downs of inventory and/or manufacturing-related assets. these circumstances include future demand or market conditions for the
companys products being less favorable than forecasted, unforeseen technological changes or changes to the companys product development plans that negatively impact the utility of any of these assets, or significant deterioration in the
financial condition of one or more of the companys suppliers that hold any of the companys manufacturing-related assets or to whom the company has made an inventory prepayment. such write-downs would adversely affect the companys
financial condition and operating results in the period when the write-downs were recorded.apple inc. | 2015 form 10-k | 34



the company accrues for estimated cancellation fees related to inventory orders that have been cancelled or
are expected to be cancelled. consistent with industry practice, the company acquires components through a combination of purchase orders, supplier contracts, and open orders in each case based on projected demand. where appropriate, the purchases
are applied to inventory component prepayments that are outstanding with the respective supplier. purchase commitments typically cover the companys forecasted component and manufacturing requirements for periods up to 150
days. if there is an abrupt and substantial decline in demand for one or more of the companys products, a change in the companys product development plans, or an unanticipated change in technological requirements for any of the
companys products, the company may be required to record additional accruals for cancellation fees that would adversely affect its results of operations in the period when the cancellation fees are identified and recorded.warranty coststhe company accrues for the estimated cost of
warranties at the time the related revenue is recognized based on historical and projected warranty claim rates, historical and projected cost-per-claim and knowledge of specific product failures that are outside of the companys typical
experience. the company regularly reviews these estimates to assess the adequacy of its recorded warranty liabilities or the current installed base of products subject to warranty protection and adjusts the amounts as necessary. if actual product
failure rates or repair costs differ from estimates, revisions to the estimated warranty liabilities would be required and could materially affect the companys financial condition and operating results.income taxesthe company records a tax provision for the
anticipated tax consequences of its reported operating results. the provision for income taxes is computed using the asset and liability method, under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences
of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates that
apply to taxable income in effect for the years in which those tax assets and liabilities are expected to be realized or settled. the company records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is believed more likely than
not to be realized.the company recognizes tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will
be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than
50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement.management believes it is more likely than not that forecasted income, including income
that may be generated as a result of certain tax planning strategies, together with future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, will be sufficient to fully recover the deferred tax assets. in the event that the company determines all
or part of the net deferred tax assets are not realizable in the future, the company will record an adjustment to the valuation allowance that would be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made. in addition, the calculation of tax
liabilities involves significant judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of gaap and complex tax laws. resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with managements expectations could have a material
impact on the companys financial condition and operating results.legal and other contingenciesas discussed in part i, item 3 of this form 10-k under the heading legal proceedings and in part ii, item 8 of this form 10-k in the
notes to consolidated financial statements in note 10, commitments and contingencies, the company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business. the company records a liability when it
is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable. there is significant judgment required in both the probability determination and as to whether an exposure can be reasonably estimated. in the opinion of management,
there was not at least a reasonable possibility the company may have incurred a material loss, or a material loss in excess of a recorded accrual, with respect to loss contingencies for asserted legal and other claims. however, the outcome of legal
proceedings and claims brought against the company is subject to significant uncertainty. therefore, although management considers the likelihood of such an outcome to be remote, if one or more of these legal matters were resolved against the
company in a reporting period for amounts in excess of managements expectations, the companys consolidated financial statements for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected.apple inc. | 2015 form 10-k | 35


## Item 7A


to provide a meaningful assessment of the foreign currency risk associated with certain of the
companys foreign currency derivative positions, the company performed a sensitivity analysis using a value-at-risk (var) model to assess the potential impact of fluctuations in exchange rates. the var model consisted of using a
monte carlo simulation to generate thousands of random market price paths assuming normal market conditions. the var is the maximum expected loss in fair value, for a given confidence interval, to the companys foreign currency derivative
positions due to adverse movements in rates. the var model is not intended to represent actual losses but is used as a risk estimation and management tool. the model assumes normal market conditions. forecasted transactions, firm commitments and
assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies were excluded from the model. based on the results of the model, the company estimates with 95% confidence a maximum one-day loss in fair value of $342 million as of september 26, 2015
compared to a maximum one-day loss in fair value of $240 million as of september 27, 2014. because the company uses foreign currency instruments for hedging purposes, the loss in fair value incurred on those instruments are generally offset by
increases in the fair value of the underlying exposures.actual future gains and losses associated with the companys investment portfolio and
derivative positions may differ materially from the sensitivity analyses performed as of september 26, 2015 due to the inherent limitations associated with predicting the timing and amount of changes in interest rates, foreign currency
exchanges rates and the companys actual exposures and positions.apple inc. | 2015 form 10-k | 37

notes to consolidated financial statementsnote 1  summary of significant accounting policiesapple inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries (collectively apple or the company) designs, manufactures and
markets mobile communication and media devices, personal computers and portable digital music players, and sells a variety of related software, services, accessories, networking solutions and third-party digital content and applications. the company
sells its products worldwide through its retail stores, online stores and direct sales force, as well as through third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers and value-added resellers. in addition, the company sells a variety of
third-party apple-compatible products, including application software and various accessories through its online and retail stores. the company sells to consumers, small and mid-sized businesses and education, enterprise and government customers.basis of presentation and preparationthe accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the company. intercompany accounts and transactions have
been eliminated. in the opinion of the companys management, the consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments, which are normal and recurring in nature, necessary for fair financial statement presentation. the preparation of these
consolidated financial statements in conformity with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles (gaap) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in these consolidated financial statements
and accompanying notes. actual results could differ materially from those estimates.the companys fiscal year is the 52 or 53-week period that
ends on the last saturday of september. the companys fiscal years 2015, 2014 and 2013 ended on september 26, 2015, september 27, 2014 and september 28, 2013, respectively. an additional week is included in the first fiscal
quarter approximately every six years to realign fiscal quarters with calendar quarters. fiscal years 2015, 2014 and 2013 each spanned 52 weeks. unless otherwise stated, references to particular years, quarters, months and periods refer to the
companys fiscal years ended in september and the associated quarters, months and periods of those fiscal years.revenue recognitionnet sales consist primarily of revenue from the sale of hardware, software, digital content and applications, accessories, and service
and support contracts. the company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the sales price is fixed or determinable and collection is probable. product is considered delivered to the customer once
it has been shipped and title, risk of loss and rewards of ownership have been transferred. for most of the companys product sales, these criteria are met at the time the product is shipped. for online sales to individuals, for some sales to
education customers in the u.s., and for certain other sales, the company defers revenue until the customer receives the product because the company retains a portion of the risk of loss on these sales during transit. for payment terms in excess of
the companys standard payment terms, revenue is recognized as payments become due unless the company has positive evidence that the sales price is fixed or determinable, such as a successful history of collection, without concession, on
comparable arrangements. the company recognizes revenue from the sale of hardware products, software bundled with hardware that is essential to the functionality of the hardware and third-party digital content sold on the itunes store in accordance
with general revenue recognition accounting guidance. the company recognizes revenue in accordance with industry specific software accounting guidance for the following types of sales transactions: (i) standalone sales of software products,
(ii) sales of software upgrades and (iii) sales of software bundled with hardware not essential to the functionality of the hardware.for
the sale of most third-party products, the company recognizes revenue based on the gross amount billed to customers because the company establishes its own pricing for such products, retains related inventory risk for physical products, is the
primary obligor to the customer and assumes the credit risk for amounts billed to its customers. for third-party applications sold through the app store and mac app store and certain digital content sold through the itunes store, the company does
not determine the selling price of the products and is not the primary obligor to the customer. therefore, the company accounts for such sales on a net basis by recognizing in net sales only the commission it retains from each sale. the portion of
the gross amount billed to customers that is remitted by the company to third-party app developers and certain digital content owners is not reflected in the companys consolidated statements of operations.apple inc. | 2015 form 10-k | 44



the company records deferred revenue when it receives payments in advance of the delivery of products or the
performance of services. this includes amounts that have been deferred for unspecified and specified software upgrade rights and non-software services that are attached to hardware and software products. the company sells gift cards redeemable at
its retail and online stores, and also sells gift cards redeemable on itunes store, app store, mac app store and ibooks store for the purchase of digital content and software. the company records deferred revenue upon the sale of the card, which is
relieved upon redemption of the card by the customer. revenue from applecare service and support contracts is deferred and recognized over the service coverage periods. applecare service and support contracts typically include extended phone
support, repair services, web-based support resources and diagnostic tools offered under the companys standard limited warranty.the company
records reductions to revenue for estimated commitments related to price protection and other customer incentive programs. for transactions involving price protection, the company recognizes revenue net of the estimated amount to be refunded. for
the companys other customer incentive programs, the estimated cost of these programs is recognized at the later of the date at which the company has sold the product or the date at which the program is offered. the company also records
reductions to revenue for expected future product returns based on the companys historical experience. revenue is recorded net of taxes collected from customers that are remitted to governmental authorities, with the collected taxes recorded
as current liabilities until remitted to the relevant government authority.revenue recognition for arrangements with multiple deliverablesfor multi-element arrangements that include hardware products containing software essential to the hardware products functionality, undelivered
software elements that relate to the hardware products essential software, and undelivered non-software services, the company allocates revenue to all deliverables based on their relative selling prices. in such circumstances, the company uses
a hierarchy to determine the selling price to be used for allocating revenue to deliverables: (i) vendor-specific objective evidence of fair value (vsoe), (ii) third-party evidence of selling price (tpe) and
(iii) best estimate of selling price (esp). vsoe generally exists only when the company sells the deliverable separately and is the price actually charged by the company for that deliverable. esps reflect the companys best
estimates of what the selling prices of elements would be if they were sold regularly on a stand-alone basis. for multi-element arrangements accounted for in accordance with industry specific software accounting guidance, the company allocates
revenue to all deliverables based on the vsoe of each element, and if vsoe does not exist revenue is recognized when elements lacking vsoe are delivered.for sales of qualifying versions of iphone, ipad and ipod touch (ios devices), mac, apple watch and apple tv, the company has indicated it
may from time to time provide future unspecified software upgrades to the devices essential software and/or non-software services free of charge. the company has identified up to three deliverables regularly included in arrangements involving
the sale of these devices. the first deliverable, which represents the substantial portion of the allocated sales price, is the hardware and software essential to the functionality of the hardware device delivered at the time of sale. the second
deliverable is the embedded right included with qualifying devices to receive on a when-and-if-available basis, future unspecified software upgrades relating to the products essential software. the third deliverable is the non-software
services to be provided to qualifying devices. the company allocates revenue between these deliverables using the relative selling price method. because the company has neither vsoe nor tpe for these deliverables, the allocation of revenue is based
on the companys esps. revenue allocated to the delivered hardware and the related essential software is recognized at the time of sale provided the other conditions for revenue recognition have been met. revenue allocated to the embedded
unspecified software upgrade rights and the non-software services is deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis over the estimated period the software upgrades and non-software services are expected to be provided. cost of sales related to
delivered hardware and related essential software, including estimated warranty costs, are recognized at the time of sale. costs incurred to provide non-software services are recognized as cost of sales as incurred, and engineering and sales and
marketing costs are recognized as operating expenses as incurred.the companys process for determining its esp for deliverables without vsoe
or tpe considers multiple factors that may vary depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each deliverable including, where applicable, prices charged by the company and market trends in the pricing for similar offerings, product
specific business objectives, length of time a particular version of a device has been available, estimated cost to provide the non-software services and the relative esp of the upgrade rights and non-software services as compared to the total
selling price of the product.beginning in september 2015, the company reduced the combined esps for ios devices and mac between $5 and $10 to
reflect the increase in competitive offers for similar products at little to no cost for users, which reduces the amount the company could reasonably charge for these deliverables on a standalone basis.shipping costsamounts billed to customers related to shipping
and handling are classified as revenue, and the companys shipping and handling costs are classified as cost of sales.apple inc. | 2015 form 10-k | 45



warranty coststhe company generally provides for the estimated cost of hardware and software warranties at the time the related revenue is recognized. the company
assesses the adequacy of its accrued warranty liabilities and adjusts the amounts as necessary based on actual experience and changes in future estimates.software development costsresearch and development
(r&d) costs are expensed as incurred. development costs of computer software to be sold, leased, or otherwise marketed are subject to capitalization beginning when a products technological feasibility has been established and
ending when a product is available for general release to customers. in most instances, the companys products are released soon after technological feasibility has been established and as a result software development costs were expensed as
incurred.advertising costsadvertising costs are
expensed as incurred and included in selling, general and administrative expenses. advertising expense was $1.8 billion, $1.2 billion and $1.1 billion for 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.share-based compensationthe company recognizes expense
related to share-based payment transactions in which it receives employee services in exchange for (a) equity instruments of the company or (b) liabilities that are based on the fair value of the companys equity instruments or that
may be settled by the issuance of such equity instruments. share-based compensation cost for restricted stock and restricted stock units (rsus) is measured based on the closing fair market value of the companys common stock on the
date of grant. the company recognizes share-based compensation cost over the awards requisite service period on a straight-line basis for time-based rsus and on a graded basis for rsus that are contingent on the achievement of performance
conditions. the company recognizes a benefit from share-based compensation in the consolidated statements of shareholders equity if an excess tax benefit is realized. in addition, the company recognizes the indirect effects of share-based
compensation on r&d tax credits, foreign tax credits and domestic manufacturing deductions in the consolidated statements of operations. further information regarding share-based compensation can be found in note 9, benefit plans.income taxesthe provision for income taxes is computed
using the asset and liability method, under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and for
operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in effect for the years in which those tax assets and liabilities are expected to be
realized or settled. the company records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is believed more likely than not to be realized.the company recognizes the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not the tax position will be sustained on
examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood
of being realized upon settlement. see note 5, income taxes for additional information.earnings per sharebasic earnings per share is computed by dividing income available to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock
outstanding during the period. diluted earnings per share is computed by dividing income available to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period increased to include the number of
additional shares of common stock that would have been outstanding if the potentially dilutive securities had been issued. potentially dilutive securities include outstanding stock options, shares to be purchased under the companys employee
stock purchase plan, unvested restricted stock and unvested rsus. the dilutive effect of potentially dilutive securities is reflected in diluted earnings per share by application of the treasury stock method. under the treasury stock method, an
increase in the fair market value of the companys common stock can result in a greater dilutive effect from potentially dilutive securities.apple inc. | 2015 form 10-k | 46

marketable securitiesall highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase are classified as cash
equivalents. the companys marketable debt and equity securities have been classified and accounted for as available-for-sale. management determines the appropriate
classification of its investments at the time of purchase and reevaluates the classifications at each balance sheet date. the company classifies its marketable debt securities as either short-term or long-term based on each instruments
underlying contractual maturity date. marketable debt securities with maturities of 12 months or less are classified as short-term and marketable debt securities with maturities greater than 12 months are classified as long-term. marketable equity
securities, including mutual funds, are classified as either short-term or long-term based on the nature of each security and its availability for use in current operations. the companys marketable debt and equity securities are carried at
fair value, with unrealized gains and losses, net of taxes, reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (aoci) in shareholders equity, with the exception of unrealized losses believed to be
other-than-temporary which are reported in earnings in the current period. the cost of securities sold is based upon the specific identification method.derivative financial instrumentsthe company accounts for its
derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities and carries them at fair value.for derivative instruments that hedge the exposure to
variability in expected future cash flows that are designated as cash flow hedges, the effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative instrument is reported as a component of aoci in shareholders equity and reclassified into earnings
in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. the ineffective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative instrument, if any, is recognized in earnings in the current period. to receive hedge accounting
treatment, cash flow hedges must be highly effective in offsetting changes to expected future cash flows on hedged transactions. for options designated as cash flow hedges, changes in the time value are excluded from the assessment of hedge
effectiveness and are recognized in earnings.for derivative instruments that hedge the exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset or a
liability and that are designated as fair value hedges, both the net gain or loss on the derivative instrument as well as the offsetting gain or loss on the hedged item are recognized in earnings in the current period.for derivative instruments and foreign currency debt that hedge the exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates used for translation of the
net investment in a foreign operation and that are designated as a net investment hedge, the net gain or loss on the effective portion of the derivative instrument is reported in the same manner as a foreign currency translation adjustment. for
forward exchange contracts designated as net investment hedges, the company excludes changes in fair value relating to changes in the forward carry component from its definition of effectiveness. accordingly, any gains or losses related to this
forward carry component are recognized in earnings in the current period.derivatives that do not qualify as hedges are adjusted to fair value
through earnings in the current period.apple inc. | 2015 form 10-k | 47



allowance for doubtful accountsthe company records its allowance for doubtful accounts based upon its assessment of various factors, including historical experience, age of the accounts
receivable balances, credit quality of the companys customers, current economic conditions and other factors that may affect the customers ability to pay.inventoriesinventories are stated at the lower of cost,
computed using the first-in, first-out method and net realizable value. any adjustments to reduce the cost of inventories to their net realizable value are recognized in earnings in the current period. as of september 26, 2015 and
september 27, 2014, the companys inventories consist primarily of finished goods.property, plant and equipmentproperty, plant and equipment are stated at cost. depreciation is computed by use of the straight-line method over
the estimated useful lives of the assets, which for buildings is the lesser of 30 years or the remaining life of the underlying building; between one to five years for machinery and equipment, including product tooling and manufacturing process
equipment; and the shorter of lease terms or ten years for leasehold improvements. the company capitalizes eligible costs to acquire or develop internal-use software that are incurred subsequent to the preliminary project stage. capitalized costs
related to internal-use software are amortized using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which range from three to five years. depreciation and amortization expense on property and equipment was $9.2 billion, $6.9
billion and $5.8 billion during 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.long-lived assets including goodwill and other acquired intangible assetsthe company reviews property, plant and equipment, inventory component prepayments and certain identifiable intangibles, excluding goodwill, for
impairment. long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. recoverability of these assets is measured by comparison of their carrying amounts
to future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate. if property, plant and equipment, inventory component prepayments and certain identifiable intangibles are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized equals the
amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds its fair value.the company does not amortize goodwill and intangible assets with
indefinite useful lives, rather such assets are required to be tested for impairment at least annually or sooner whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the assets may be impaired. the company performs its goodwill and intangible
asset impairment tests in the fourth quarter of each year. the company did not recognize any impairment charges related to goodwill or indefinite lived intangible assets during 2015, 2014 and 2013. the company established reporting units based on
its current reporting structure. for purposes of testing goodwill for impairment, goodwill has been allocated to these reporting units to the extent it relates to each reporting unit. in 2015 and 2014, the companys goodwill was primarily
allocated to the americas and europe reporting units.the company amortizes its intangible assets with definite useful lives over their estimated
useful lives and reviews these assets for impairment. the company typically amortizes its acquired intangible assets with definite useful lives over periods from three to seven years.fair value measurementsthe company applies fair value
accounting for all financial assets and liabilities and non-financial assets and liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis. the company defines fair value as the price that would be
received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. when determining the fair value measurements for assets and liabilities, which are required to be recorded
at fair value, the company considers the principal or most advantageous market in which the company would transact and the market-based risk measurements or assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, such as
risks inherent in valuation techniques, transfer restrictions and credit risk. fair value is estimated by applying the following hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value into three levels and bases the categorization within
the hierarchy upon the lowest level of input that is available and significant to the fair value measurement:level 1  quoted prices in active markets
for identical assets or liabilities.level 2  observable inputs other than quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and
liabilities, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in inactive markets, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.level 3  inputs that are generally unobservable and typically reflect managements estimate of assumptions that market participants
would use in pricing the asset or liability.apple inc. | 2015 form 10-k | 48

the companys valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of money market funds and certain
marketable equity securities were derived from quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. the valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of the companys debt instruments and all other financial instruments,
all of which have counterparties with high credit ratings, were valued based on quoted market prices or model driven valuations using significant inputs derived from or corroborated by observable market data.in accordance with the fair value accounting requirements, companies may choose to measure eligible financial instruments and certain other items at fair
value. the company has not elected the fair value option for any eligible financial instruments.foreign currency translation and remeasurementthe company translates the assets and liabilities of its non-u.s. dollar functional currency subsidiaries into u.s. dollars using exchange rates in effect
at the end of each period. revenue and expenses for these subsidiaries are translated using rates that approximate those in effect during the period. gains and losses from these translations are recognized in foreign currency translation included in
aoci in shareholders equity. the companys subsidiaries that use the u.s. dollar as their functional currency remeasure monetary assets and liabilities at exchange rates in effect at the end of each period, and inventories, property and
nonmonetary assets and liabilities at historical rates.note 2  financial instrumentscash, cash equivalents and marketable securitiesthe following tables show the companys cash and available-for-sale

including, but not limited to, anticipation of credit deterioration and duration management. the maturities of the companys long-term marketable securities generally range from one to five years.as of september 26, 2015, the company considers the declines in market value of its marketable securities investment portfolio to be temporary in
nature and does not consider any of its investments other-than-temporarily impaired. the company typically invests in highly-rated securities, and its investment policy generally limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. the policy
generally requires investments to be investment grade, with the primary objective of minimizing the potential risk of principal loss. fair values were determined for each individual security in the investment portfolio. when evaluating an investment
for other-than-temporary impairment the company reviews factors such as the length of time and extent to which fair value has been below its cost basis, the financial condition of the issuer and any changes thereto, changes in market interest rates
and the companys intent to sell, or whether it is more likely than not it will be required to sell the investment before recovery of the investments cost basis.derivative financial instrumentsthe company may use
derivatives to partially offset its business exposure to foreign currency and interest rate risk on expected future cash flows, on net investments in certain foreign subsidiaries and on certain existing assets and liabilities. however, the company
may choose not to hedge certain exposures for a variety of reasons including, but not limited to, accounting considerations and the prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures. there can be no assurance the hedges will offset more than
a portion of the financial impact resulting from movements in foreign currency exchange or interest rates.to help protect gross margins from
fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, certain of the companys subsidiaries whose functional currency is the u.s. dollar may hedge a portion of forecasted foreign currency revenue, and subsidiaries whose functional currency is not
the u.s. dollar and who sell in local currencies may hedge a portion of forecasted inventory purchases not denominated in the subsidiaries functional currencies. the company may enter into forward contracts, option contracts or other
instruments to manage this risk and may designate these instruments as cash flow hedges. the company typically hedges portions of its forecasted foreign currency exposure associated with revenue and inventory purchases, typically for up to 12
months.to help protect the net investment in a foreign operation from adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates, the company may enter
into foreign currency forward and option contracts to offset the changes in the carrying amounts of these investments due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. in addition, the company may use non-derivative financial instruments, such
as its foreign currency-denominated debt, as economic hedges of its net investments in certain foreign subsidiaries. in both of these cases, the company designates these instruments as net investment hedges.apple inc. | 2015 form 10-k | 50

the company may also enter into non-designated foreign currency contracts to partially offset the foreign
currency exchange gains and losses generated by the re-measurement of certain assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies.the
company may enter into interest rate swaps, options, or other instruments to manage interest rate risk. these instruments may offset a portion of changes in income or expense, or changes in fair value of the companys term debt or investments.
the company designates these instruments as either cash flow or fair value hedges. the companys hedged interest rate transactions as of september 26, 2015 are expected to be recognized within 10 years.cash flow hedgesthe effective portions of cash flow hedges
are recorded in aoci until the hedged item is recognized in earnings. deferred gains and losses associated with cash flow hedges of foreign currency revenue are recognized as a component of net sales in the same period as the related revenue is
recognized, and deferred gains and losses related to cash flow hedges of inventory purchases are recognized as a component of cost of sales in the same period as the related costs are recognized. deferred gains and losses associated with cash flow
hedges of interest income or expense are recognized in other income/(expense), net in the same period as the related income or expense is recognized. the ineffective portions and amounts excluded from the effectiveness testing of cash flow hedges
are recognized in other income/(expense), net.derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges must be de-designated as hedges when it is
probable the forecasted hedged transaction will not occur in the initially identified time period or within a subsequent two-month time period. deferred gains and losses in aoci associated with such derivative instruments are reclassified
immediately into other income/(expense), net. any subsequent changes in fair value of such derivative instruments are reflected in other income/(expense), net unless they are re-designated as hedges of other transactions.net investment hedgesthe effective portions of net investment

the notional amounts for outstanding derivative instruments provide one measure of the transaction volume
outstanding and do not represent the amount of the companys exposure to credit or market loss. the credit risk amounts represent the companys gross exposure to potential accounting loss on derivative instruments that are outstanding or
unsettled if all counterparties failed to perform according to the terms of the contract, based on then-current currency or interest rates at each respective date. the companys exposure to credit loss
and market risk will vary over time as currency and interest rates change. although the table above reflects the notional and credit risk amounts of the companys derivative instruments, it does not reflect the gains or losses associated with
the exposures and transactions that the instruments are intended to hedge. the amounts ultimately realized upon settlement of these financial instruments, together with the gains and losses on the underlying exposures, will depend on actual market
conditions during the remaining life of the instruments.the company generally enters into master netting arrangements, which are designed to reduce
credit risk by permitting net settlement of transactions with the same counterparty. to further limit credit risk, the company generally enters into collateral security arrangements that provide for collateral to be received or posted when the net
fair value of certain financial instruments fluctuates from contractually established thresholds. the company presents its derivative assets and derivative liabilities at their gross fair values in its consolidated balance sheets. the net cash
collateral received by the company related to derivative instruments under its collateral security arrangements was $1.0 billion as of september 26, 2015 and $2.1 billion as of september 27, 2014.under master netting arrangements with the respective counterparties to the companys derivative contracts, the company is allowed to net
settle transactions with a single net amount payable by one party to the other. as of september 26, 2015 and september 27, 2014, the potential effects of these rights of set-off associated with the companys derivative contracts,
including the effects of collateral, would be a reduction to both derivative assets and derivative liabilities of $2.2 billion and $1.6 billion, respectively, resulting in net derivative liabilities of $78 million and $549
million, respectively.accounts receivabletrade receivablesthe company has considerable trade receivables outstanding with its third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers, value-added resellers,
small and mid-sized businesses and education, enterprise and government customers. the company generally does not require collateral from its customers; however, the company will require collateral in certain instances to limit credit risk. in
addition, when possible, the company attempts to limit credit risk on trade receivables with credit insurance for certain customers or by requiring third-party financing, loans or leases to support credit exposure. these credit-financing
arrangements are directly between the third-party financing company and the end customer. as such, the company generally does not assume any recourse or credit risk sharing related to any of these arrangements.as of september 26, 2015, the company had one customer that represented 10% or more of total trade receivables, which accounted for 12%. as of
september 27, 2014, the company had two customers that represented 10% or more of total trade receivables, one of which accounted for 16% and the other 13%. the companys cellular network carriers accounted for 71% and 72% of trade
receivables as of september 26, 2015 and september 27, 2014, respectively.vendor non-trade receivablesthe company has non-trade receivables from certain of its manufacturing vendors resulting from the sale of components to these vendors who manufacture
sub-assemblies or assemble final products for the company. the company purchases these components directly from suppliers. vendor non-trade receivables from three of the companys vendors accounted for 38%, 18% and 14% of total vendor non-trade
receivables as of september 26, 2015 and three of the companys vendors accounted for 51%, 16% and 14% of total vendor non-trade receivables as of september 27, 2014.note 3  consolidated financial statement detailsthe following tables show the companys consolidated financial statement details as of september 26, 2015 and

temporary differences between the consolidated financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and are measured using enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in the years in which those
temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.uncertain tax positionstax positions are evaluated in a two-step process. the company first determines whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained
upon examination. if a tax position meets the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold it is then measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements. the tax position is measured as the largest amount of benefit
that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. the company classifies gross interest and penalties and unrecognized tax benefits that are not expected to result in payment or receipt of cash within one year as
non-current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets.as of september 26, 2015, the total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits was
$6.9 billion, of which $2.5 billion, if recognized, would affect the companys effective tax rate. as of september 27, 2014, the total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits was $4.0 billion, of which $1.4 billion, if recognized, would

the company is subject to taxation and files income tax returns in the u.s. federal jurisdiction and in many
state and foreign jurisdictions. the u.s. internal revenue service (the irs) is currently examining the years 2010 through 2012, and all years prior to 2010 are closed. in addition, the company is subject to audits by state, local and
foreign tax authorities. in major states and major foreign jurisdictions, the years subsequent to 2003 generally remain open and could be subject to examination by the taxing authorities.management believes that an adequate provision has been made for any adjustments that may result from tax examinations. however, the outcome of tax
audits cannot be predicted with certainty. if any issues addressed in the companys tax audits are resolved in a manner not consistent with managements expectations, the company could be required to adjust its provision for income taxes
in the period such resolution occurs. although timing of the resolution and/or closure of audits is not certain, the company does not believe it is reasonably possible that its unrecognized tax benefits would materially change in the next
12 months.on june 11, 2014, the european commission issued an opening decision initiating a formal investigation against ireland for
alleged state aid to the company. the opening decision concerns the allocation of profits for taxation purposes of the irish branches of two subsidiaries of the company. the company believes the european commissions assertions are without
merit. if the european commission were to conclude against ireland, the european commission could require ireland to recover from the company past taxes covering a period of up to 10 years reflective of the disallowed state aid. while such amount
could be material, as of september 26, 2015 the company is unable to estimate the impact.note 6  debtcommercial paperin 2014, the board of
directors authorized the company to issue unsecured short-term promissory notes (commercial paper) pursuant to a commercial paper program. the company intends to use net proceeds from the commercial paper program for general corporate
purposes, including dividends and share repurchases. as of september 26, 2015 and september 27, 2014, the company had $8.5 billion and $6.3 billion of commercial paper outstanding, respectively, with a weighted-average interest rate of

share repurchase programin the third quarter of 2015, the companys board of directors increased the share repurchase authorization to $140 billion of the companys
common stock, of which $104 billion had been utilized as of september 26, 2015. the companys share repurchase program does not obligate it to acquire any specific number of shares. under the program, shares may be repurchased in privately
negotiated and/or open market transactions, including under plans complying with rule 10b5-1 under the securities exchange act of 1934, as amended (the exchange act).the company has entered, and in the future may enter, into accelerated share repurchase arrangements (asrs) with financial institutions. in
exchange for up-front payments, the financial institutions deliver shares of the companys common stock during the purchase periods of each asr. the total number of shares ultimately delivered, and therefore the average repurchase price paid
per share, is determined at the end of the applicable purchase period of each asr based on the volume weighted-average price of the companys common stock during that period. the shares received are retired in the periods they are delivered,
and the up-front payments are accounted for as a reduction to shareholders equity in the companys consolidated balance sheets in the periods the payments are made. the company reflects the asrs as a repurchase of common stock in the
period delivered for purposes of calculating earnings per share and as forward contracts indexed to its own common stock. the asrs met all of the applicable criteria for equity classification, and therefore were not accounted for as derivative
instruments.the following table shows the companys asr activity and related information during the years ended september 26, 2015 and

note 9  benefit plans2014 employee stock planin the second
quarter of 2014, shareholders approved the 2014 employee stock plan (the 2014 plan) and terminated the companys authority to grant new awards under the 2003 employee stock plan (the 2003 plan). the 2014 plan provides
for broad-based equity grants to employees, including executive officers, and permits the granting of rsus, stock grants, performance-based awards, stock options and stock appreciation rights, as well as cash bonus awards. rsus granted under the
2014 plan generally vest over four years, based on continued employment, and are settled upon vesting in shares of the companys common stock on a one-for-one basis. each share issued with respect to rsus granted under the 2014 plan reduces the
number of shares available for grant under the plan by two shares. rsus cancelled and shares withheld to satisfy tax withholding obligations increase the number of shares available for grant under the 2014 plan utilizing a factor of two times the
number of rsus cancelled or shares withheld. currently, all rsus granted under the 2014 plan have dividend equivalent rights (ders), which entitle holders of rsus to the same dividend value per share as holders of common stock. ders are
subject to the same vesting and other terms and conditions as the corresponding unvested rsus. ders are accumulated and paid when the underlying shares vest. upon approval of the 2014 plan, the company reserved 385 million shares plus the
number of shares remaining that were reserved but not issued under the 2003 plan. shares subject to outstanding awards under the 2003 plan that expire, are cancelled or otherwise terminate, or are withheld to satisfy tax withholding obligations with
respect to rsus, will also be available for awards under the 2014 plan. as of september 26, 2015, approximately 442.9 million shares were reserved for future issuance under the 2014 plan.2003 employee stock planthe 2003 plan is a shareholder
approved plan that provided for broad-based equity grants to employees, including executive officers. the 2003 plan permitted the granting of incentive stock options, nonstatutory stock options, rsus, stock appreciation rights, stock purchase rights
and performance-based awards. options granted under the 2003 plan generally expire seven to ten years after the grant date and generally become exercisable over a period of four years, based on continued employment, with either annual, semi-annual
or quarterly vesting. rsus granted under the 2003 plan generally vest over two to four years, based on continued employment and are settled upon vesting in shares of the companys common stock on a one-for-one basis. all rsus, other than rsus
held by the chief executive officer, granted under the 2003 plan have ders. ders are subject to the same vesting and other terms and conditions as the corresponding unvested rsus. ders are accumulated and paid when the underlying shares vest. in the
second quarter of 2014, the company terminated the authority to grant new awards under the 2003 plan.1997 director stock planthe 1997 director stock plan (the director plan) is a shareholder approved plan that (i) permits the company to grant awards of rsus or
stock options to the companys non-employee directors, (ii) provides for automatic initial grants of rsus upon a non-employee director joining the board of directors and automatic annual grants of rsus at each annual meeting of
shareholders, and (iii) permits the board of directors to prospectively change the relative mixture of stock options and rsus for the initial and annual award grants and the methodology for determining the number of shares of the companys
common stock subject to these grants without shareholder approval. each share issued with respect to rsus granted under the director plan reduces the number of shares available for grant under the plan by two shares. the director plan expires
november 9, 2019. all rsus granted under the director plan are entitled to ders. ders are subject to the same vesting and other terms and conditions as the corresponding unvested rsus. ders are accumulated and paid when the underlying shares
vest. as of september 26, 2015, approximately 1.2 million shares were reserved for future issuance under the director plan.rule 10b5-1 trading plansduring the fourth quarter of 2015, section 16 officers timothy d. cook, angela ahrendts, luca maestri, daniel riccio, philip schiller and
jeffrey williams had equity trading plans in place in accordance with rule 10b5-1(c)(1) under the exchange act. an equity trading plan is a written document that pre-establishes the amounts, prices and dates (or formula for determining the amounts,
prices and dates) of future purchases or sales of the companys stock, including shares acquired pursuant to the companys employee and director equity plans.employee stock purchase planthe employee stock purchase plan
(the purchase plan) is a shareholder approved plan under which substantially all employees may purchase the companys common stock through payroll deductions at a price equal to 85% of the lower of the fair market values of the
stock as of the beginning or the end of six-month offering periods. an employees payroll deductions under the purchase plan are limited to 10% of the employees compensation and employees may not purchase more than $25,000 of stock during
any calendar year. as of september 26, 2015, approximately 53.0 million shares were reserved for future issuance under the purchase plan.apple inc. | 2015 form 10-k | 62

401(k) planthe
companys 401(k) plan is a deferred salary arrangement under section 401(k) of the internal revenue code. under the 401(k) plan, participating u.s. employees may defer a portion of their pre-tax earnings, up to the irs annual contribution
limit ($18,000 for calendar year 2015). the company matches 50% to 100% of each employees contributions, depending on length of service, up to a maximum 6% of the employees eligible earnings. the companys matching contributions to
the 401(k) plan were $200 million, $163 million and $135 million in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.restricted stock unitsa summary of the companys rsu activity and related information for 2015, 2014 and 2013, is as follows:balance at september 29, 2012rsus grantedrsus vestedrsus cancelledbalance at september 28, 2013rsus grantedrsus vestedrsus cancelledbalance at september 27, 2014rsus grantedrsus vestedrsus cancelledbalance at september 26, 2015the fair value as of the respective vesting dates of rsus was $4.8 billion, $3.4 billion and $3.1 billion for 2015, 2014
and 2013, respectively. the majority of rsus that vested in 2015, 2014 and 2013 were net-share settled such that the company withheld shares with value equivalent to the employees minimum statutory obligation for the applicable income and
other employment taxes, and remitted the cash to the appropriate taxing authorities. the total shares withheld were approximately 14.1 million, 15.6 million and 15.5 million for 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively, and were based on the
value of the rsus on their respective vesting dates as determined by the companys closing stock price. total payments for the employees tax obligations to taxing authorities were $1.6 billion, $1.2 billion and $1.1 billion in 2015, 2014
and 2013, respectively, and are reflected as a financing activity within the consolidated statements of cash flows. these net-share settlements had the effect of share repurchases by the company as they reduced the number of shares that would
have otherwise been issued as a result of the vesting and did not represent an expense to the company.stock optionsthe company had 1.2 million stock options outstanding as of september 26, 2015, with a weighted-average exercise price per share of $15.08 and
weighted-average remaining contractual term of 4.1 years, substantially all of which are exercisable. the aggregate intrinsic value of the stock options outstanding as of september 26, 2015 was $120 million, which represents the value of the
companys closing stock price on the last trading day of the period in excess of the weighted-average exercise price multiplied by the number of options outstanding. total intrinsic value of options at time of exercise was $479 million, $1.5
billion and $1.0 billion for 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.apple inc. | 2015 form 10-k | 63

that the software infringes third-party intellectual property rights. other agreements entered into by the company sometimes include indemnification provisions under which the company could be subject to costs and/or damages in the event of an
infringement claim against the company or an indemnified third-party. in the opinion of management, there was not at least a reasonable possibility the company may have incurred a material loss with respect to indemnification of end-users of its
operating system or application software for infringement of third-party intellectual property rights. the company did not record a liability for infringement costs related to indemnification as of september 26, 2015 or september 27, 2014.in september 2015, the company introduced the iphone upgrade program, which is available to customers who purchase an iphone 6s and 6s plus in one
of its u.s. physical retail stores and activate the purchased iphone with one of the four national carriers. the iphone upgrade program provides customers the right to trade in that iphone for a new iphone, provided certain conditions are met. one
of the conditions of this program requires the customer to finance the initial purchase price of the iphone with a third-party lender. upon exercise of the trade-in right and purchase of a new iphone, the company satisfies the customers
outstanding balance due to the third-party lender on the original device. the company accounts for the trade-in right as a guarantee liability and recognizes arrangement revenue net of the fair value of such right with subsequent changes to the
guarantee liability recognized within revenue.the company has entered into indemnification agreements with its directors and executive officers.
under these agreements, the company has agreed to indemnify such individuals to the fullest extent permitted by law against liabilities that arise by reason of their status as directors or officers and to advance expenses incurred by such
individuals in connection with related legal proceedings. it is not possible to determine the maximum potential amount of payments the company could be required to make under these agreements due to the limited history of prior indemnification
claims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each claim. however, the company maintains directors and officers liability insurance coverage to reduce its exposure to such obligations.concentrations in the available sources of supply of materials and productalthough most components essential to the companys business are generally available from multiple sources, a number of components are currently
obtained from single or limited sources. in addition, the company competes for various components with other participants in the markets for mobile communication and media devices and personal computers. therefore, many components used by the
company, including those that are available from multiple sources, are at times subject to industry-wide shortage and significant pricing fluctuations that could materially adversely affect the companys financial condition and operating
results.apple inc. | 2015 form 10-k | 64

the company uses some custom components that are not commonly used by its competitors, and new products
introduced by the company often utilize custom components available from only one source. when a component or product uses new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers yields have matured or manufacturing
capacity has increased. if the companys supply of components for a new or existing product were delayed or constrained, or if an outsourcing partner delayed shipments of completed products to the company, the companys financial condition
and operating results could be materially adversely affected. the companys business and financial performance could also be materially adversely affected depending on the time required to obtain sufficient quantities from the original source,
or to identify and obtain sufficient quantities from an alternative source. continued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at all, may be affected if those suppliers concentrated on the production of common components instead of
components customized to meet the companys requirements.the company has entered into agreements for the supply of many components; however,
there can be no guarantee that the company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms, or at all. therefore, the company remains subject to significant risks of supply shortages and price increases that could materially
adversely affect its financial condition and operating results.substantially all of the companys hardware products are manufactured by
outsourcing partners that are located primarily in asia. a significant concentration of this manufacturing is currently performed by a small number of outsourcing partners, often in single locations. certain of these outsourcing partners are the
sole-sourced suppliers of components and manufacturers for many of the companys products. although the company works closely with its outsourcing partners on manufacturing schedules, the companys operating results could be adversely
affected if its outsourcing partners were unable to meet their production commitments. the companys purchase commitments typically cover its requirements for periods up to 150 days.other off-balance sheet commitmentsoperating leasesthe company leases various equipment and facilities, including retail space, under noncancelable operating lease arrangements. the company does not
currently utilize any other off-balance sheet financing arrangements. the major facility leases are typically for terms not exceeding 10 years and generally contain multi-year renewal options. as of september 26, 2015, the company had a total
of 463 retail stores. leases for retail space are for terms ranging from five to 20 years, the majority of which are for 10 years, and often contain multi-year renewal options. as of september 26, 2015, the companys total future minimum
lease payments under noncancelable operating leases were $6.3 billion, of which $3.6 billion related to leases for retail space.rent expense under
all operating leases, including both cancelable and noncancelable leases, was $794 million, $717 million and $645 million in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. future minimum lease payments under noncancelable operating leases having remaining terms
in excess of one year as of september 26, 2015, are as follows (in millions):20162017201820192020thereaftertotalother commitmentsthe company
utilizes several outsourcing partners to manufacture sub-assemblies for the companys products and to perform final assembly and testing of finished products. these outsourcing partners acquire components and build product based on demand
information supplied by the company, which typically covers periods up to 150 days. the company also obtains individual components for its products from a wide variety of individual suppliers. consistent with industry practice, the company acquires
components through a combination of purchase orders, supplier contracts and open orders based on projected demand information. where appropriate, the purchases are applied to inventory component prepayments that
are outstanding with the respective supplier. as of september 26, 2015, the company had outstanding off-balance sheet third-party manufacturing commitments and component purchase commitments of $29.5 billion.apple inc. | 2015 form 10-k | 65



in addition to the commitments mentioned above, the company had other off-balance sheet obligations of $7.3
billion as of september 26, 2015 that consisted of commitments to acquire capital assets, including product tooling and manufacturing process equipment, and commitments related to inventory prepayments, advertising, licensing, r&d, internet
and telecommunications services, energy and other obligations.contingenciesthe company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that have arisen in the ordinary course of business and that have not been fully
adjudicated, certain of which are discussed in part i, item 1a of this form 10-k under the heading risk factors and in part i, item 3 of this form 10-k under the heading legal proceedings. in the opinion of
management, there was not at least a reasonable possibility the company may have incurred a material loss, or a material loss in excess of a recorded accrual, with respect to loss contingencies for asserted legal and other claims. however, the
outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain. therefore, although management considers the likelihood of such an outcome to be remote, if one or more of these legal matters were resolved against the company in a reporting period for amounts in
excess of managements expectations, the companys consolidated financial statements for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected.apple inc. v. samsung electronics co., ltd, et al.on
august 24, 2012, a jury returned a verdict awarding the company $1.05 billion in its lawsuit against samsung electronics co., ltd and affiliated parties in the united states district court, northern district of california, san jose division. on
march 6, 2014, the district court entered final judgment in favor of the company in the amount of approximately $930 million. on may 18, 2015, the u.s. court of appeals for the federal circuit affirmed in part, and reversed in part,
the decision of the district court. as a result, the court of appeals ordered entry of final judgment on damages in the amount of approximately $548 million, with the district court to determine supplemental damages and interest, as well as damages
owed for products subject to the reversal in part. because the ruling remains subject to further proceedings, the company has not recognized the award in its results of operations.note 11  segment information and geographic datathe company reports segment information based on the management approach. the management approach designates the internal
reporting used by management for making decisions and assessing performance as the source of the companys reportable operating segments.the
company manages its business primarily on a geographic basis. the companys reportable operating segments consist of the americas, europe, greater china, japan and rest of asia pacific. the americas segment includes both north and south
america. the europe segment includes european countries, as well as india, the middle east and africa. the greater china segment includes china, hong kong and taiwan. the rest of asia pacific segment includes australia and those asian countries not
included in the companys other reportable operating segments. although each reportable operating segment provides similar hardware and software products and similar services, they are managed separately to better align with the location of the
companys customers and distribution partners and the unique market dynamics of each geographic region. the accounting policies of the various segments are the same as those described in note 1, summary of significant accounting
policies.the company evaluates the performance of its reportable operating segments based on net sales and operating income. net sales for
geographic segments are generally based on the location of customers and sales through the companys retail stores located in those geographic locations. operating income for each segment includes net sales to third parties, related cost of
sales and operating expenses directly attributable to the segment. advertising expenses are generally included in the geographic segment in which the expenditures are incurred. operating income for each segment excludes other income and expense and
certain expenses managed outside the reportable operating segments. costs excluded from segment operating income include various corporate expenses such as r&d, corporate marketing expenses, certain share-based compensation expenses, income
taxes, various nonrecurring charges and other separately managed general and administrative costs. the company does not include intercompany transfers between segments for management reporting purposes.apple inc. | 2015 form 10-k | 66

# 2017 AAPL

## Item 1A


The Company markets certain mobile communication and media devices based on the iOS mobile operating system and also markets related services, including third-party digital content and applications. The Company faces substantial competition in these markets from companies that have significant technical, marketing, distribution and other resources, as well as established hardware, software and digital content supplier relationships; and the Company has a minority market share in the global smartphone market. Additionally, the Company faces significant competition as competitors reduce their selling prices and attempt to imitate the Company’s product features and applications within their own products or, alternatively, collaborate with each other to offer solutions that are more competitive than those they currently offer. The Company competes with business models that provide content to users for free. The Company also competes with illegitimate means to obtain third-party digital content and applications. Some of the Company’s competitors have greater experience, product breadth and distribution channels than the Company. Because some current and potential competitors have substantial resources and/or experience and a lower cost structure, they may be able to provide products and services at little or no profit or even at a loss. The Company also expects competition to intensify as competitors attempt to imitate the Company’s approach to providing components seamlessly within their individual offerings or work collaboratively to offer integrated solutions. The Company’s financial condition and operating results depend substantially on the Company’s ability to continually improve iOS and iOS devices in order to maintain their functional and design advantages.The Company is the only authorized maker of hardware using macOS, which has a minority market share in the personal computer market. This market has been contracting and is dominated by computer makers using competing operating systems, most notably Windows. In the market for personal computers and accessories, the Company faces a significant number of competitors, many of which have broader product lines, lower-priced products and a larger installed customer base. Historically, consolidation in this market has resulted in larger competitors. Competition has been particularly intense as competitors have aggressively cut prices and lowered product margins. An increasing number of internet-enabled devices that include software applications and are smaller and simpler than traditional personal computers compete for market share with the Company’s existing products. The Company’s financial condition and operating results also depend on its ability to continually improve the Mac platform to maintain its functional and design advantages.There can be no assurance the Company will be able to continue to provide products and services that compete effectively.To remain competitive and stimulate customer demand, the Company must successfully manage frequent product introductions and transitions.Due to the highly volatile and competitive nature of the industries in which the Company competes, the Company must continually introduce new products, services and technologies, enhance existing products and services, effectively stimulate customer demand for new and upgraded products and successfully manage the transition to these new and upgraded products. The success of new product introductions depends on a number of factors including, but not limited to, timely and successful product development, market acceptance, the Company’s ability to manage the risks associated with new product production ramp-up issues, the availability of application software for new products, the effective management of purchase commitments and inventory levels in line with anticipated product demand, the availability of products in appropriate quantities and at expected costs to meet anticipated demand and the risk that new products may have quality or other defects or deficiencies in the early stages of introduction. Accordingly, the Company cannot determine in advance the ultimate effect of new product introductions and transitions.The Company depends on the performance of distributors, carriers and other resellers.The Company distributes its products through cellular network carriers, wholesalers, national and regional retailers and value-added resellers, many of whom distribute products from competing manufacturers. The Company also sells its products and third-party products in most of its major markets directly to education, enterprise and government customers and consumers and small and mid-sized businesses through its retail and online stores.Some carriers providing cellular network service for iPhone subsidize users’ purchases of the device. There is no assurance that such subsidies will be continued at all or in the same amounts upon renewal of the Company’s agreements with these carriers or in agreements the Company enters into with new carriers.The Company has invested and will continue to invest in programs to enhance reseller sales, including staffing selected resellers’ stores with Company employees and contractors, and improving product placement displays. These programs could require a substantial investment while providing no assurance of return or incremental revenue. The financial condition of these resellers could weaken, these resellers could stop distributing the Company’s products, or uncertainty regarding demand for some or all of the Company’s products could cause resellers to reduce their ordering and marketing of the Company’s products.Apple Inc. | 2017 Form 10-K | 9



The Company faces substantial inventory and other asset risk in addition to purchase commitment cancellation risk.The Company records a write-down for product and component inventories that have become obsolete or exceed anticipated demand or net realizable value and accrues necessary cancellation fee reserves for orders of excess products and components. The Company also reviews its long-lived assets, including capital assets held at its suppliers’ facilities and inventory prepayments, for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. If the Company determines that impairment has occurred, it records a write-down equal to the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value. Although the Company believes its provisions related to inventory, capital assets, inventory prepayments and other assets and purchase commitments are currently adequate, no assurance can be given that the Company will not incur additional related charges given the rapid and unpredictable pace of product obsolescence in the industries in which the Company competes.The Company must order components for its products and build inventory in advance of product announcements and shipments. Manufacturing purchase obligations typically cover forecasted component and manufacturing requirements for periods up to 150 days. Because the Company’s markets are volatile, competitive and subject to rapid technology and price changes, there is a risk the Company will forecast incorrectly and order or produce excess or insufficient amounts of components or products, or not fully utilize firm purchase commitments.Future operating results depend upon the Company’s ability to obtain components in sufficient quantities on commercially reasonable terms.Because the Company currently obtains components from single or limited sources, the Company is subject to significant supply and pricing risks. Many components, including those that are available from multiple sources, are at times subject to industry-wide shortages and significant commodity pricing fluctuations. While the Company has entered into agreements for the supply of many components, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms, or at all. A number of suppliers of components may suffer from poor financial conditions, which can lead to business failure for the supplier or consolidation within a particular industry, further limiting the Company’s ability to obtain sufficient quantities of components on commercially reasonable terms. The effects of global or regional economic conditions on the Company’s suppliers, described in “Global and regional economic conditions could materially adversely affect the Company” above, also could affect the Company’s ability to obtain components. Therefore, the Company remains subject to significant risks of supply shortages and price increases.The Company’s new products often utilize custom components available from only one source. When a component or product uses new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers’ yields have matured or manufacturing capacity has increased. Continued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at all, may be affected for any number of reasons, including if those suppliers decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the Company’s requirements. The supply of components for a new or existing product could be delayed or constrained, or a key manufacturing vendor could delay shipments of completed products to the Company.The Company depends on component and product manufacturing and logistical services provided by outsourcing partners, many of which are located outside of the U.S.Substantially all of the Company’s manufacturing is performed in whole or in part by a few outsourcing partners located primarily in Asia. The Company has also outsourced much of its transportation and logistics management. While these arrangements may lower operating costs, they also reduce the Company’s direct control over production and distribution. It is uncertain what effect such diminished control will have on the quality or quantity of products or services, or the Company’s flexibility to respond to changing conditions. Although arrangements with these partners may contain provisions for warranty expense reimbursement, the Company may remain responsible to the consumer for warranty service in the event of product defects and could experience an unanticipated product defect or warranty liability. While the Company relies on its partners to adhere to its supplier code of conduct, material violations of the supplier code of conduct could occur.The Company relies on sole-sourced outsourcing partners in the U.S., Asia and Europe to supply and manufacture many critical components, and on outsourcing partners primarily located in Asia, for final assembly of substantially all of the Company’s hardware products. Any failure of these partners to perform may have a negative impact on the Company’s cost or supply of components or finished goods. In addition, manufacturing or logistics in these locations or transit to final destinations may be disrupted for a variety of reasons including, but not limited to, natural and man-made disasters, information technology system failures, commercial disputes, military actions or economic, business, labor, environmental, public health, or political issues.The Company has invested in manufacturing process equipment, much of which is held at certain of its outsourcing partners, and has made prepayments to certain of its suppliers associated with long-term supply agreements. While these arrangements help ensure the supply of components and finished goods, if these outsourcing partners or suppliers experience severe financial problems or other disruptions in their business, such continued supply could be reduced or terminated and the net realizable value of these assets could be negatively impacted.Apple Inc. | 2017 Form 10-K | 10



The Company’s products and services may experience quality problems from time to time that can result in decreased sales and operating margin and harm to the Company’s reputation.The Company sells complex hardware and software products and services that can contain design and manufacturing defects. Sophisticated operating system software and applications, such as those sold by the Company, often contain “bugs” that can unexpectedly interfere with the software’s intended operation. The Company’s online services may from time to time experience outages, service slowdowns or errors. Defects may also occur in components and products the Company purchases from third parties. There can be no assurance the Company will be able to detect and fix all defects in the hardware, software and services it sells. Failure to do so could result in lost revenue, significant warranty and other expenses and harm to the Company’s reputation.The Company relies on access to third-party digital content, which may not be available to the Company on commercially reasonable terms or at all.The Company contracts with numerous third parties to offer their digital content to customers. This includes the right to sell currently available music, movies, TV shows and books. The licensing or other distribution arrangements with these third parties are for relatively short terms and do not guarantee the continuation or renewal of these arrangements on reasonable terms, if at all. Some third-party content providers and distributors currently or in the future may offer competing products and services, and could take action to make it more difficult or impossible for the Company to license or otherwise distribute their content in the future. Other content owners, providers or distributors may seek to limit the Company’s access to, or increase the cost of, such content. The Company may be unable to continue to offer a wide variety of content at reasonable prices with acceptable usage rules, or continue to expand its geographic reach. Failure to obtain the right to make third-party digital content available, or to make such content available on commercially reasonable terms, could have a material adverse impact on the Company’s financial condition and operating results.Some third-party digital content providers require the Company to provide digital rights management and other security solutions. If requirements change, the Company may have to develop or license new technology to provide these solutions. There is no assurance the Company will be able to develop or license such solutions at a reasonable cost and in a timely manner. In addition, certain countries have passed or may propose and adopt legislation that would force the Company to license its digital rights management, which could lessen the protection of content and subject it to piracy and also could negatively affect arrangements with the Company’s content providers.The Company’s future performance depends in part on support from third-party software developers.The Company believes decisions by customers to purchase its hardware products depend in part on the availability of third-party software applications and services. There is no assurance that third-party developers will continue to develop and maintain software applications and services for the Company’s products. If third-party software applications and services cease to be developed and maintained for the Company’s products, customers may choose not to buy the Company’s products.With respect to its Mac products, the Company believes the availability of third-party software applications and services depends in part on the developers’ perception and analysis of the relative benefits of developing, maintaining and upgrading such software for the Company’s products compared to Windows-based products. This analysis may be based on factors such as the market position of the Company and its products, the anticipated revenue that may be generated, expected future growth of Mac sales and the costs of developing such applications and services. If the Company’s minority share of the global personal computer market causes developers to question the Mac’s prospects, developers could be less inclined to develop or upgrade software for the Company’s Mac products and more inclined to devote their resources to developing and upgrading software for the larger Windows market.With respect to iOS devices, the Company relies on the continued availability and development of compelling and innovative software applications, including applications distributed through the App Store. iOS devices are subject to rapid technological change, and, if third-party developers are unable to or choose not to keep up with this pace of change, third-party applications might not successfully operate and may result in dissatisfied customers. As with applications for the Company’s Mac products, the availability and development of these applications also depend on developers’ perceptions and analysis of the relative benefits of developing, maintaining or upgrading software for the Company’s iOS devices rather than its competitors’ platforms, such as Android. If developers focus their efforts on these competing platforms, the availability and quality of applications for the Company’s iOS devices may suffer.Apple Inc. | 2017 Form 10-K | 11



The Company relies on access to third-party intellectual property, which may not be available to the Company on commercially reasonable terms or at all.Many of the Company’s products include third-party intellectual property, which requires licenses from those third parties. Based on past experience and industry practice, the Company believes such licenses generally can be obtained on reasonable terms. There is, however, no assurance that the necessary licenses can be obtained on acceptable terms or at all. Failure to obtain the right to use third-party intellectual property, or to use such intellectual property on commercially reasonable terms, could preclude the Company from selling certain products or otherwise have a material adverse impact on the Company’s financial condition and operating results.The Company could be impacted by unfavorable results of legal proceedings, such as being found to have infringed on intellectual property rights.The Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that have arisen in the ordinary course of business and have not yet been fully resolved, and new claims may arise in the future. In addition, agreements entered into by the Company sometimes include indemnification provisions which may subject the Company to costs and damages in the event of a claim against an indemnified third party.Claims against the Company based on allegations of patent infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights have generally increased over time and may continue to increase. In particular, the Company has historically faced a significant number of patent claims relating to its cellular-enabled products, and new claims may arise in the future. For example, technology and other patent-holding companies frequently assert their patents and seek royalties and often enter into litigation based on allegations of patent infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. The Company is vigorously defending infringement actions in courts in a number of U.S. jurisdictions and before the U.S. International Trade Commission, as well as internationally in various countries. The plaintiffs in these actions frequently seek injunctions and substantial damages.Regardless of the merit of particular claims, litigation may be expensive, time-consuming, disruptive to the Company’s operations and distracting to management. In recognition of these considerations, the Company may enter into licensing agreements or other arrangements to settle litigation and resolve such disputes. No assurance can be given that such agreements can be obtained on acceptable terms or that litigation will not occur. These agreements may also significantly increase the Company’s operating expenses.In management’s opinion, there is not at least a reasonable possibility the Company may have incurred a material loss, or a material loss in excess of a recorded accrual, with respect to loss contingencies, including matters related to infringement of intellectual property rights. However, the outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain.Although management considers the likelihood of such an outcome to be remote, if one or more legal matters were resolved against the Company or an indemnified third party in a reporting period for amounts in excess of management’s expectations, the Company’s consolidated financial statements for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected. Further, such an outcome could result in significant compensatory, punitive or trebled monetary damages, disgorgement of revenue or profits, remedial corporate measures or injunctive relief against the Company that could materially adversely affect its financial condition and operating results.While the Company maintains insurance coverage for certain types of claims, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise.The Company is subject to laws and regulations worldwide, changes to which could increase the Company’s costs and individually or in the aggregate adversely affect the Company’s business.The Company is subject to laws and regulations affecting its domestic and international operations in a number of areas. These U.S. and foreign laws and regulations affect the Company’s activities including, but not limited to, in areas of labor, advertising, digital content, consumer protection, real estate, billing, e-commerce, promotions, quality of services, telecommunications, mobile communications and media, television, intellectual property ownership and infringement, tax, import and export requirements, anti-corruption, foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions, data privacy requirements, anti-competition, environmental, health and safety.By way of example, laws and regulations related to mobile communications and media devices in the many jurisdictions in which the Company operates are extensive and subject to change. Such changes could include, among others, restrictions on the production, manufacture, distribution and use of devices, locking devices to a carrier’s network, or mandating the use of devices on more than one carrier’s network. These devices are also subject to certification and regulation by governmental and standardization bodies, as well as by cellular network carriers for use on their networks. These certification processes are extensive and time consuming, and could result in additional testing requirements, product modifications, or delays in product shipment dates, or could preclude the Company from selling certain products.Apple Inc. | 2017 Form 10-K | 12



Compliance with these laws, regulations and similar requirements may be onerous and expensive, and they may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, further increasing the cost of compliance and doing business. Any such costs, which may rise in the future as a result of changes in these laws and regulations or in their interpretation, could individually or in the aggregate make the Company’s products and services less attractive to the Company’s customers, delay the introduction of new products in one or more regions, or cause the Company to change or limit its business practices. The Company has implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations, but there can be no assurance that the Company’s employees, contractors, or agents will not violate such laws and regulations or the Company’s policies and procedures.The Company’s business is subject to the risks of international operations.The Company derives a significant portion of its revenue and earnings from its international operations. Compliance with applicable U.S. and foreign laws and regulations, such as import and export requirements, anti-corruption laws, tax laws, foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions, data privacy requirements, environmental laws, labor laws and anti-competition regulations, increases the costs of doing business in foreign jurisdictions. Although the Company has implemented policies and procedures to comply with these laws and regulations, a violation by the Company’s employees, contractors or agents could nevertheless occur. In some cases, compliance with the laws and regulations of one country could violate the laws and regulations of another country. Violations of these laws and regulations could materially adversely affect the Company’s brand, international growth efforts and business.The Company also could be significantly affected by other risks associated with international activities including, but not limited to, economic and labor conditions, increased duties, taxes and other costs and political instability. Margins on sales of the Company’s products in foreign countries, and on sales of products that include components obtained from foreign suppliers, could be materially adversely affected by international trade regulations, including duties, tariffs and antidumping penalties. The Company is also exposed to credit and collectability risk on its trade receivables with customers in certain international markets. There can be no assurance the Company can effectively limit its credit risk and avoid losses.The Company’s retail stores have required and will continue to require a substantial investment and commitment of resources and are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties.The Company’s retail stores have required substantial investment in equipment and leasehold improvements, information systems, inventory and personnel. The Company also has entered into substantial operating lease commitments for retail space. Certain stores have been designed and built to serve as high-profile venues to promote brand awareness and serve as vehicles for corporate sales and marketing activities. Because of their unique design elements, locations and size, these stores require substantially more investment than the Company’s more typical retail stores. Due to the high cost structure associated with the Company’s retail stores, a decline in sales or the closure or poor performance of individual or multiple stores could result in significant lease termination costs, write-offs of equipment and leasehold improvements and severance costs.Many factors unique to retail operations, some of which are beyond the Company’s control, pose risks and uncertainties. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, macro-economic factors that could have an adverse effect on general retail activity, as well as the Company’s inability to manage costs associated with store construction and operation, the Company’s failure to manage relationships with its existing retail partners, more challenging environments in managing retail operations outside the U.S., costs associated with unanticipated fluctuations in the value of retail inventory, and the Company’s inability to obtain and renew leases in quality retail locations at a reasonable cost.Investment in new business strategies and acquisitions could disrupt the Company’s ongoing business and present risks not originally contemplated.The Company has invested, and in the future may invest, in new business strategies or acquisitions. Such endeavors may involve significant risks and uncertainties, including distraction of management from current operations, greater than expected liabilities and expenses, inadequate return of capital and unidentified issues not discovered in the Company’s due diligence. These new ventures are inherently risky and may not be successful.The Company’s business and reputation may be impacted by information technology system failures or network disruptions.The Company may be subject to information technology system failures or network disruptions caused by natural disasters, accidents, power disruptions, telecommunications failures, acts of terrorism or war, computer viruses, physical or electronic break-ins, or other events or disruptions. System redundancy and other continuity measures may be ineffective or inadequate, and the Company’s business continuity and disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities. Such failures or disruptions could adversely impact the Company’s business by, among other things, preventing access to the Company’s online services, interfering with customer transactions or impeding the manufacturing and shipping of the Company’s products. These events could materially adversely affect the Company’s reputation, financial condition and operating results.Apple Inc. | 2017 Form 10-K | 13



There may be losses or unauthorized access to or releases of confidential information, including personally identifiable information, that could subject the Company to significant reputational, financial, legal and operational consequences.The Company’s business requires it to use and store confidential information, including, among other things, personally identifiable information (“PII”) with respect to the Company’s customers and employees. The Company devotes significant resources to network and data security, including through the use of encryption and other security measures intended to protect its systems and data. But these measures cannot provide absolute security, and losses or unauthorized access to or releases of confidential information may still occur, which could materially adversely affect the Company’s reputation, financial condition and operating results.The Company’s business also requires it to share confidential information with suppliers and other third parties. Although the Company takes steps to secure confidential information that is provided to third parties, such measures may not be effective and losses or unauthorized access to or releases of confidential information may still occur, which could materially adversely affect the Company’s reputation, financial condition and operating results.For example, the Company may experience a security breach impacting the Company’s information technology systems that compromises the confidentiality, integrity or availability of confidential information. Such an incident could, among other things, impair the Company’s ability to attract and retain customers for its products and services, impact the Company’s stock price, materially damage supplier relationships, and expose the Company to litigation or government investigations, which could result in penalties, fines or judgments against the Company.Although malicious attacks perpetrated to gain access to confidential information, including PII, affect many companies across various industries, the Company is at a relatively greater risk of being targeted because of its high profile and the value of the confidential information it creates, owns, manages, stores and processes.The Company has implemented systems and processes intended to secure its information technology systems and prevent unauthorized access to or loss of sensitive data, including through the use of encryption and authentication technologies. As with all companies, these security measures may not be sufficient for all eventualities and may be vulnerable to hacking, employee error, malfeasance, system error, faulty password management or other irregularities. For example, third parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees or customers into disclosing user names, passwords or other sensitive information, which may in turn be used to access the Company’s information technology systems. To help protect customers and the Company, the Company monitors its services and systems for unusual activity and may freeze accounts under suspicious circumstances, which, among other things, may result in the delay or loss of customer orders or impede customer access to the Company’s products and services.In addition to the risks relating to general confidential information described above, the Company may also be subject to specific obligations relating to health data and payment card data. Health data may be subject to additional privacy, security and breach notification requirements, and the Company may be subject to audit by governmental authorities regarding the Company’s compliance with these obligations. If the Company fails to adequately comply with these rules and requirements, or if health data is handled in a manner not permitted by law or under the Company’s agreements with healthcare institutions, the Company could be subject to litigation or government investigations, may be liable for associated investigatory expenses, and could also incur significant fees or fines.Under payment card rules and obligations, if cardholder information is potentially compromised, the Company could be liable for associated investigatory expenses and could also incur significant fees or fines if the Company fails to follow payment card industry data security standards. The Company could also experience a significant increase in payment card transaction costs or lose the ability to process payment cards if it fails to follow payment card industry data security standards, which would materially adversely affect the Company’s reputation, financial condition and operating results.While the Company maintains insurance coverage that is intended to address certain aspects of data security risks, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise.The Company’s business is subject to a variety of U.S. and international laws, rules, policies and other obligations regarding data protection.The Company is subject to federal, state and international laws relating to the collection, use, retention, security and transfer of PII. In many cases, these laws apply not only to third-party transactions, but also may restrict transfers of PII among the Company and its international subsidiaries. Several jurisdictions have passed laws in this area, and other jurisdictions are considering imposing additional restrictions. These laws continue to develop and may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Complying with emerging and changing international requirements may cause the Company to incur substantial costs or require the Company to change its business practices. Noncompliance could result in significant penalties or legal liability.The Company makes statements about its use and disclosure of PII through its privacy policy, information provided on its website and press statements. Any failure by the Company to comply with these public statements or with other federal, state or international privacy-related or data protection laws and regulations could result in proceedings against the Company by governmental entities or others. In addition to reputational impacts, penalties could include ongoing audit requirements and significant legal liability.Apple Inc. | 2017 Form 10-K | 14



The Company’s success depends largely on the continued service and availability of key personnel.Much of the Company’s future success depends on the continued availability and service of key personnel, including its Chief Executive Officer, executive team and other highly skilled employees. Experienced personnel in the technology industry are in high demand and competition for their talents is intense, especially in Silicon Valley, where most of the Company’s key personnel are located.The Company’s business may be impacted by political events, war, terrorism, public health issues, natural disasters and other business interruptions.War, terrorism, geopolitical uncertainties, public health issues and other business interruptions have caused and could cause damage or disruption to international commerce and the global economy, and thus could have a material adverse effect on the Company, its suppliers, logistics providers, manufacturing vendors and customers, including channel partners. The Company’s business operations are subject to interruption by, among others, natural disasters, whether as a result of climate change or otherwise, fire, power shortages, nuclear power plant accidents and other industrial accidents, terrorist attacks and other hostile acts, labor disputes, public health issues and other events beyond its control. Such events could decrease demand for the Company’s products, make it difficult or impossible for the Company to make and deliver products to its customers, including channel partners, or to receive components from its suppliers, and create delays and inefficiencies in the Company’s supply chain. While the Company’s suppliers are required to maintain safe working environments and operations, an industrial accident could occur and could result in disruption to the Company’s business and harm to the Company’s reputation. Should major public health issues, including pandemics, arise, the Company could be adversely affected by more stringent employee travel restrictions, additional limitations in freight services, governmental actions limiting the movement of products between regions, delays in production ramps of new products and disruptions in the operations of the Company’s manufacturing vendors and component suppliers. The majority of the Company’s R&D activities, its corporate headquarters, information technology systems and other critical business operations, including certain component suppliers and manufacturing vendors, are in locations that could be affected by natural disasters. In the event of a natural disaster, the Company could incur significant losses, require substantial recovery time and experience significant expenditures in order to resume operations.The Company expects its quarterly revenue and operating results to fluctuate.The Company’s profit margins vary across its products and distribution channels. The Company’s software, accessories, and service and support contracts generally have higher gross margins than certain of the Company’s other products. Gross margins on the Company’s hardware products vary across product lines and can change over time as a result of product transitions, pricing and configuration changes, and component, warranty, and other cost fluctuations. The Company’s direct sales generally have higher associated gross margins than its indirect sales through its channel partners. In addition, the Company’s gross margin and operating margin percentages, as well as overall profitability, may be materially adversely impacted as a result of a shift in product, geographic or channel mix, component cost increases, the strengthening U.S. dollar, price competition, or the introduction of new products, including those that have higher cost structures with flat or reduced pricing.The Company has typically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters due in part to seasonal holiday demand. Additionally, new product introductions can significantly impact net sales, product costs and operating expenses. Further, the Company generates a majority of its net sales from a single product and a decline in demand for that product could significantly impact quarterly net sales. The Company could also be subject to unexpected developments late in a quarter, such as lower-than-anticipated demand for the Company’s products, issues with new product introductions, an internal systems failure, or failure of one of the Company’s logistics, components supply, or manufacturing partners.The Company’s stock price is subject to volatility.The Company’s stock price has experienced substantial price volatility in the past and may continue to do so in the future. Additionally, the Company, the technology industry and the stock market as a whole have experienced extreme stock price and volume fluctuations that have affected stock prices in ways that may have been unrelated to these companies’ operating performance. Price volatility over a given period may cause the average price at which the Company repurchases its own stock to exceed the stock’s price at a given point in time. The Company believes its stock price should reflect expectations of future growth and profitability. The Company also believes its stock price should reflect expectations that its cash dividend will continue at current levels or grow and that its current share repurchase program will be fully consummated. Future dividends are subject to declaration by the Company’s Board of Directors, and the Company’s share repurchase program does not obligate it to acquire any specific number of shares. If the Company fails to meet expectations related to future growth, profitability, dividends, share repurchases or other market expectations, its stock price may decline significantly, which could have a material adverse impact on investor confidence and employee retention.Apple Inc. | 2017 Form 10-K | 15



The Company’s financial performance is subject to risks associated with changes in the value of the U.S. dollar versus local currencies.The Company’s primary exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates relates to non-U.S. dollar-denominated sales and operating expenses worldwide. Weakening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar adversely affects the U.S. dollar value of the Company’s foreign currency-denominated sales and earnings, and generally leads the Company to raise international pricing, potentially reducing demand for the Company’s products. Margins on sales of the Company’s products in foreign countries and on sales of products that include components obtained from foreign suppliers, could be materially adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. In some circumstances, for competitive or other reasons, the Company may decide not to raise local prices to fully offset the dollar’s strengthening, or at all, which would adversely affect the U.S. dollar value of the Company’s foreign currency-denominated sales and earnings. Conversely, a strengthening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, while generally beneficial to the Company’s foreign currency-denominated sales and earnings, could cause the Company to reduce international pricing and incur losses on its foreign currency derivative instruments, thereby limiting the benefit. Additionally, strengthening of foreign currencies may increase the Company’s cost of product components denominated in those currencies, thus adversely affecting gross margins.The Company uses derivative instruments, such as foreign currency forward and option contracts, to hedge certain exposures to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. The use of such hedging activities may not offset any, or more than a portion, of the adverse financial effects of unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates over the limited time the hedges are in place.The Company is exposed to credit risk and fluctuations in the market values of its investment portfolio.Given the global nature of its business, the Company has both domestic and international investments. Credit ratings and pricing of the Company’s investments can be negatively affected by liquidity, credit deterioration, financial results, economic risk, political risk, sovereign risk or other factors. As a result, the value and liquidity of the Company’s cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities may fluctuate substantially. Therefore, although the Company has not realized any significant losses on its cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, future fluctuations in their value could result in significant realized losses.The Company is exposed to credit risk on its trade accounts receivable, vendor non-trade receivables and prepayments related to long-term supply agreements, and this risk is heightened during periods when economic conditions worsen.The Company distributes its products through third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers and value-added resellers. The Company also sells its products directly to small and mid-sized businesses and education, enterprise and government customers. A substantial majority of the Company’s outstanding trade receivables are not covered by collateral, third-party financing arrangements or credit insurance. The Company’s exposure to credit and collectability risk on its trade receivables is higher in certain international markets and its ability to mitigate such risks may be limited. The Company also has unsecured vendor non-trade receivables resulting from purchases of components by outsourcing partners and other vendors that manufacture sub-assemblies or assemble final products for the Company. In addition, the Company has made prepayments associated with long-term supply agreements to secure supply of inventory components. As of September 30, 2017, a significant portion of the Company’s trade receivables was concentrated within cellular network carriers, and its vendor non-trade receivables and prepayments related to long-term supply agreements were concentrated among a few individual vendors located primarily in Asia. While the Company has procedures to monitor and limit exposure to credit risk on its trade and vendor non-trade receivables, as well as long-term prepayments, there can be no assurance such procedures will effectively limit its credit risk and avoid losses.The Company could be subject to changes in its tax rates, the adoption of new U.S. or international tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities.The Company is subject to taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions, including Ireland, where a number of the Company’s subsidiaries are organized. Due to economic and political conditions, tax rates in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change. The Company’s effective tax rates could be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, or changes in tax laws or their interpretation, including in the U.S. and Ireland.The Company is also subject to the examination of its tax returns and other tax matters by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”) and other tax authorities and governmental bodies. The Company regularly assesses the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of its provision for taxes. There can be no assurance as to the outcome of these examinations. If the Company’s effective tax rates were to increase, particularly in the U.S. or Ireland, or if the ultimate determination of the Company’s taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued, the Company’s financial condition, operating results and cash flows could be adversely affected.None.Apple Inc. | 2017 Form 10-K | 16

Product PerformanceiPhoneThe following table presents iPhone net sales and unit sales information for 2017, 2016 and 2015 (dollars in millions and units in thousands):iPhone net sales increased during 2017 compared to 2016 due to higher iPhone unit sales and a different mix of iPhones with higher average selling prices. The weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar had an unfavorable impact on iPhone net sales during 2017 compared to 2016.iPhone net sales decreased during 2016 compared to 2015. The Company believes the sales decline was due primarily to a lower rate of iPhone upgrades during 2016 compared to 2015 and challenging macroeconomic conditions in a number of major markets in 2016. Average selling prices for iPhone were lower year-over-year during 2016 due primarily to a different mix of iPhones, including the iPhone SE introduced in 2016, and the effect of weakness in most foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar.iPadThe following table presents iPad net sales and unit sales information for 2017, 2016 and 2015 (dollars in millions and units in thousands):iPad net sales decreased during 2017 compared to 2016 due to lower iPad unit sales and a different mix of iPads with lower average selling prices. The weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar had an unfavorable impact on iPad net sales during 2017 compared to 2016.iPad net sales decreased during 2016 compared to 2015 primarily due to lower unit sales and the effect of weakness in most foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, partially offset by higher average selling price due to a shift in mix to higher-priced iPads. MacThe following table presents Mac net sales and unit sales information for 2017, 2016 and 2015 (dollars in millions and units in thousands):Mac net sales increased during 2017 compared to 2016 due primarily to a different mix of Macs with higher average selling prices and higher Mac unit sales. The weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar had an unfavorable impact on Mac net sales during 2017 compared to 2016.Mac net sales decreased during 2016 compared to 2015 primarily due to lower year-over-year Mac unit sales, which declined at rates similar to the overall market. The effect of weakness in most foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar also negatively impacted Mac net sales.Apple Inc. | 2017 Form 10-K | 24

ServicesThe following table presents Services net sales information for 2017, 2016 and 2015 (dollars in millions):The year-over-year growth in Services net sales in 2017 was due primarily to increases in App Store and licensing sales. Services net sales in the fourth quarter of 2017 included a favorable one-time adjustment of $640 million due to a change in estimate based on the availability of additional supporting information.The year-over-year increase in Services net sales in 2016 was due primarily to growth from the App Store, licensing and AppleCare sales, partially offset by the effect of weakness in most foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar. During the first quarter of 2016, the Company received $548 million from Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. related to its patent infringement lawsuit, which was recorded as licensing net sales within Services.Segment Operating PerformanceThe Company manages its business primarily on a geographic basis. The Company’s reportable segments consist of the Americas, Europe, Greater China, Japan and Rest of Asia Pacific. Americas includes both North and South America. Europe includes European countries, as well as India, the Middle East and Africa. Greater China includes China, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Rest of Asia Pacific includes Australia and those Asian countries not included in the Company’s other reportable segments. Although the reportable segments provide similar hardware and software products and similar services, each one is managed separately to better align with the location of the Company’s customers and distribution partners and the unique market dynamics of each geographic region. Further information regarding the Company’s reportable segments can be found in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Note 11, “Segment Information and Geographic Data.”AmericasThe following table presents Americas net sales information for 2017, 2016 and 2015 (dollars in millions):Americas net sales increased during 2017 compared to 2016 due primarily to higher net sales of iPhone, Services and Mac.Americas net sales decreased during 2016 compared to 2015 due primarily to lower net sales of iPhone.EuropeThe following table presents Europe net sales information for 2017, 2016 and 2015 (dollars in millions):Europe net sales increased during 2017 compared to 2016 due primarily to higher net sales of iPhone and Services.

The Company anticipates gross margin percentage during the first quarter of 2018 to be between 38.0% and 38.5%. The foregoing statement regarding the Company’s expected gross margin percentage in the first quarter of 2018 is forward-looking and could differ from actual results. The Company’s future gross margins can be impacted by multiple factors including, but not limited to, those set forth in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K under the heading “Risk Factors” and those described in this paragraph. In general, the Company believes gross margins will remain under downward pressure due to a variety of factors, including continued industry-wide global product pricing pressures, increased competition, compressed product life cycles, product transitions, potential increases in the cost of components, and potential strengthening of the U.S. dollar, as well as potential increases in the costs of outside manufacturing services and a potential shift in the Company’s sales mix towards products with lower gross margins. In response to competitive pressures, the Company expects it will continue to take product pricing actions, which would adversely affect gross margins. Gross margins could also be affected by the Company’s ability to manage product quality and warranty costs effectively and to stimulate demand for certain of its products. Due to the Company’s significant international operations, its financial condition and operating results, including gross margins, could be significantly affected by fluctuations in exchange rates.Operating ExpensesOperating expenses for 2017, 2016 and 2015 were as follows (dollars in millions):Research and DevelopmentThe year-over-year growth in R&D expense in 2017 and 2016 was driven primarily by increases in headcount-related expenses and material costs to support expanded R&D activities. The Company continues to believe that focused investments in R&D are critical to its future growth and competitive position in the marketplace, and to the development of new and updated products and services that are central to the Company’s core business strategy.Selling, General and AdministrativeThe year-over-year growth in selling, general and administrative expense in 2017 compared to 2016 was driven primarily by an increase in headcount-related expenses, variable selling expenses and infrastructure-related costs. The decrease in selling, general and administrative expense in 2016 compared to 2015 was due primarily to lower discretionary expenditures and advertising costs, partially offset by an increase in headcount-related expenses.Other Income/(Expense), NetOther income/(expense), net for 2017, 2016 and 2015 was as follows (dollars in millions):The year-over-year increase in other income/(expense), net during 2017 was due primarily to higher interest income and the favorable impact of foreign exchange-related items, partially offset by higher interest expense on debt. The year-over-year increase in other income/(expense), net during 2016 was due primarily to higher interest income, partially offset by higher interest expense on debt and the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange-related items. The weighted-average interest rate earned by the Company on its cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities was 1.99%, 1.73% and 1.49% in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.Apple Inc. | 2017 Form 10-K | 27

Provision for Income TaxesProvision for income taxes and effective tax rates for 2017, 2016 and 2015 were as follows (dollars in millions):The Company’s effective tax rates for 2017, 2016 and 2015 differ from the statutory federal income tax rate of 35% due primarily to certain undistributed foreign earnings, a substantial portion of which was generated by subsidiaries organized in Ireland, for which no U.S. taxes are provided when such earnings are intended to be indefinitely reinvested outside the U.S. The lower effective tax rate in 2017 compared to 2016 was due to a different geographic mix of earnings and higher U.S. R&D tax credits. The lower effective tax rate in 2016 compared to 2015 was due primarily to greater R&D tax credits.As of September 30, 2017, the Company had deferred tax assets arising from deductible temporary differences, tax losses and tax credits of $3.9 billion and deferred tax liabilities of $31.5 billion. Management believes it is more likely than not that forecasted income, including income that may be generated as a result of certain tax planning strategies, together with future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, will be sufficient to fully recover the deferred tax assets. The Company will continue to evaluate the realizability of deferred tax assets quarterly by assessing the need for and the amount of a valuation allowance.The IRS concluded its review of the years 2010 through 2012 during the third quarter of 2017. All years prior to 2013 are closed, and the IRS is currently examining the years 2013 through 2015. The Company is also subject to audits by state, local and foreign tax authorities. In major states and major foreign jurisdictions, the years subsequent to 2003 generally remain open and could be subject to examination by the taxing authorities. Management believes that adequate provisions have been made for any adjustments that may result from tax examinations. However, the outcome of tax audits cannot be predicted with certainty. If any issues addressed in the Company’s tax audits are resolved in a manner not consistent with management’s expectations, the Company could be required to adjust its provision for income taxes in the period such resolution occurs.On August 30, 2016, the European Commission announced its decision that Ireland granted state aid to the Company by providing tax opinions in 1991 and 2007 concerning the tax allocation of profits of the Irish branches of two subsidiaries of the Company (the “State Aid Decision”). The State Aid Decision orders Ireland to calculate and recover additional taxes from the Company for the period June 2003 through December 2014. Irish legislative changes, effective as of January 2015, eliminated the application of the tax opinions from that date forward. The Company believes the State Aid Decision to be without merit and appealed to the General Court of the Court of Justice of the European Union. Ireland has also appealed the State Aid Decision. Although Ireland is still computing the recovery amount, the Company expects the amount to be in line with the European Commission’s announced recovery amount of €13 billion, plus interest of €1 billion. Once the recovery amount is finalized by Ireland, the Company anticipates funding it, including interest, out of foreign cash. These amounts are expected to be placed into escrow in 2018, where they will remain pending conclusion of all appeals. The Company believes that any incremental Irish corporate income taxes potentially due related to the State Aid Decision would be creditable against U.S. taxes.Recent Accounting PronouncementsHedgingIn August 2017, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2017-12, Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities (“ASU 2017-12”). ASU 2017-12 expands component and fair value hedging, specifies the presentation of the effects of hedging instruments, and eliminates the separate measurement and presentation of hedge ineffectiveness. The Company will adopt ASU 2017-12 in its first quarter of 2020 utilizing the modified retrospective transition method and is currently evaluating the impact of adoption on its consolidated financial statements.Restricted CashIn November 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-18, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Restricted Cash (“ASU 2016-18”), which enhances and clarifies the guidance on the classification and presentation of restricted cash in the statement of cash flows. The Company will adopt ASU 2016-18 in its first quarter of 2019 utilizing the retrospective transition method. Currently, the Company’s restricted cash balance is not significant.Apple Inc. | 2017 Form 10-K | 28



Income TaxesIn October 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-16, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory (“ASU 2016-16”), which requires the recognition of the income tax consequences of an intra-entity transfer of an asset, other than inventory, when the transfer occurs. The Company will adopt ASU 2016-16 in its first quarter of 2019 utilizing the modified retrospective transition method. Currently, the Company anticipates recording up to $9 billion of net deferred tax assets on its Consolidated Balance Sheets upon adoption. However, the ultimate impact of adopting ASU 2016-16 will depend on the balance of intellectual property transferred between its subsidiaries as of the adoption date. The Company will recognize incremental deferred income tax expense thereafter as these deferred tax assets are utilized.Stock CompensationIn March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09, Compensation – Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting (“ASU 2016-09”), which modifies certain aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including income taxes, classification of awards, and classification in the statement of cash flows. The Company will adopt ASU 2016-09 in its first quarter of 2018. Currently, excess tax benefits or deficiencies from the Company’s equity awards are recorded as additional paid-in capital in its Consolidated Balance Sheets. Upon adoption, the Company will record any excess tax benefits or deficiencies from its equity awards in its Consolidated Statements of Operations in the reporting periods in which vesting occurs. As a result, subsequent to adoption the Company’s income tax expense and associated effective tax rate will be impacted by fluctuations in stock price between the grant dates and vesting dates of equity awards.Leases In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) (“ASU 2016-02”), which modifies lease accounting for lessees to increase transparency and comparability by recording lease assets and liabilities for operating leases and disclosing key information about leasing arrangements. The Company will adopt ASU 2016-02 in its first quarter of 2020 utilizing the modified retrospective transition method. While the Company is currently evaluating the timing and impact of adopting ASU 2016-02, currently the Company anticipates recording lease assets and liabilities in excess of $9.5 billion on its Consolidated Balance Sheets, with no material impact to its Consolidated Statements of Operations. However, the ultimate impact of adopting ASU 2016-02 will depend on the Company’s lease portfolio as of the adoption date.Financial Instruments In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-01, Financial Instruments – Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities (“ASU 2016-01”), which updates certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of financial instruments. The Company will adopt ASU 2016-01 in its first quarter of 2019 utilizing the modified retrospective transition method. Based on the composition of the Company’s investment portfolio, the adoption of ASU 2016-01 is not expected to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments – Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments (“ASU 2016-13”), which modifies the measurement of expected credit losses of certain financial instruments. The Company will adopt ASU 2016-13 in its first quarter of 2021 utilizing the modified retrospective transition method. Based on the composition of the Company’s investment portfolio, current market conditions, and historical credit loss activity, the adoption of ASU 2016-13 is not expected to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.Revenue Recognition In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) (“ASU 2014-09”), which amends the existing accounting standards for revenue recognition. ASU 2014-09 is based on principles that govern the recognition of revenue at an amount an entity expects to be entitled when products are transferred to customers.Subsequently, the FASB has issued the following standards related to ASU 2014-09: ASU No. 2016-08, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Principal versus Agent Considerations (“ASU 2016-08”); ASU No. 2016-10, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing (“ASU 2016-10”); ASU No. 2016-12, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients (“ASU 2016-12”); and ASU No. 2016-20, Technical Corrections and Improvements to Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (“ASU 2016-20”). The Company must adopt ASU 2016-08, ASU 2016-10, ASU 2016-12 and ASU 2016-20 with ASU 2014-09 (collectively, the “new revenue standards”).The new revenue standards may be applied retrospectively to each prior period presented or retrospectively with the cumulative effect recognized as of the date of adoption. The Company will adopt the new revenue standards in its first quarter of 2019 utilizing the full retrospective transition method. The new revenue standards are not expected to have a material impact on the amount and timing of revenue recognized in the Company’s consolidated financial statements.Apple Inc. | 2017 Form 10-K | 29

Liquidity and Capital ResourcesThe following table presents selected financial information and statistics as of and for the years ended September 30, 2017, September 24, 2016 and September 26, 2015 (in millions):The Company believes its existing balances of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities will be sufficient to satisfy its working capital needs, capital asset purchases, outstanding commitments and other liquidity requirements associated with its existing operations over the next 12 months. The Company currently anticipates the cash used for future dividends, the share repurchase program and debt repayments will come from its current domestic cash, cash generated from ongoing U.S. operating activities and from borrowings.As of September 30, 2017 and September 24, 2016, the Company’s cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities held by foreign subsidiaries were $252.3 billion and $216.0 billion, respectively, and are generally based in U.S. dollar-denominated holdings. Amounts held by foreign subsidiaries are generally subject to U.S. income taxation on repatriation to the U.S. In connection with the State Aid Decision, Ireland is still computing the recovery amount. The Company expects the amount to be in line with the European Commission’s announced recovery amount of €13 billion, plus interest of €1 billion. Once the recovery amount is finalized by Ireland, the Company anticipates funding it, including interest, out of foreign cash. These amounts are expected to be placed into escrow in 2018, where they will remain pending conclusion of all appeals.The Company’s marketable securities investment portfolio is primarily invested in highly-rated securities, and its investment policy generally limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. The policy generally requires investments to be investment grade, with the primary objective of minimizing the potential risk of principal loss.During 2017, cash generated by operating activities of $63.6 billion was a result of $48.4 billion of net income, non-cash adjustments to net income of $20.8 billion and a decrease in the net change in operating assets and liabilities of $5.6 billion, which included a one-time payment of $1.9 billion related to a multi-year license agreement. Cash used in investing activities of $46.4 billion during 2017 consisted primarily of cash used for purchases of marketable securities, net of sales and maturities, of $33.1 billion and cash used to acquire property, plant and equipment of $12.5 billion. Cash used in financing activities of $17.3 billion during 2017 consisted primarily of cash used to repurchase common stock of $32.9 billion, cash used to pay dividends and dividend equivalents of $12.8 billion and cash used to repay term debt of $3.5 billion, partially offset by proceeds from the issuance of term debt, net of $28.7 billion and proceeds from commercial paper, net of $3.9 billion.During 2016, cash generated by operating activities of $65.8 billion was a result of $45.7 billion of net income and non-cash adjustments to net income of $20.1 billion.

Cash used in financing activities of $20.5 billion during 2016 consisted primarily of cash used to repurchase common stock of $29.7 billion, cash used to pay dividends and dividend equivalents of $12.2 billion and cash used to repay term debt of $2.5 billion, partially offset by proceeds from the issuance of term debt, net of $25.0 billion.Capital AssetsThe Company’s capital expenditures were $14.9 billion during 2017. The Company anticipates utilizing approximately $16.0 billion for capital expenditures during 2018, which includes product tooling and manufacturing process equipment; data centers; corporate facilities and infrastructure, including information systems hardware, software and enhancements; and retail store facilities.DebtThe Company issues unsecured short-term promissory notes (“Commercial Paper”) pursuant to a commercial paper program. The Company uses the net proceeds from the commercial paper program for general corporate purposes, including dividends and share repurchases. As of September 30, 2017, the Company had $12.0 billion of Commercial Paper outstanding, with a weighted-average interest rate of 1.20% and maturities generally less than nine months.Apple Inc. | 2017 Form 10-K | 30

The following table presents certain payments due by the Company as of September 30, 2017, and excludes amounts already recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, except for term debt (in millions):Operating LeasesAs of September 30, 2017, the Company’s total future minimum lease payments under noncancelable operating leases were $9.5 billion. The Company’s retail store and other facility leases typically have original terms not exceeding 10 years and generally contain multi-year renewal options.Manufacturing Purchase ObligationsThe Company utilizes several outsourcing partners to manufacture sub-assemblies for the Company’s products and to perform final assembly and testing of finished products. These outsourcing partners acquire components and build product based on demand information supplied by the Company, which typically covers periods up to 150 days. The Company also obtains individual components for its products from a wide variety of individual suppliers. As of September 30, 2017, the Company expects to pay $37.6 billion under manufacturing-related supplier arrangements, substantially all of which is noncancelable.Other Purchase ObligationsThe Company’s other purchase obligations consisted of noncancelable obligations to acquire capital assets, including product tooling and manufacturing process equipment, and noncancelable obligations related to advertising, licensing, R&D, internet and telecommunications services and other obligations. As of September 30, 2017, the Company had other purchase obligations of $6.1 billion.The Company’s other non-current liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets consist primarily of deferred tax liabilities, gross unrecognized tax benefits and the related gross interest and penalties. As of September 30, 2017, the Company had deferred tax liabilities of $31.5 billion, gross unrecognized tax benefits of $8.4 billion and an additional $1.2 billion for gross interest and penalties. At this time, the Company is unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments due to uncertainties in the timing of tax audit outcomes; therefore, such amounts are not included in the above contractual obligation table.IndemnificationAgreements entered into by the Company sometimes include indemnification provisions which may subject the Company to costs and damages in the event of a claim against an indemnified third party. In the opinion of management, there was not at least a reasonable possibility the Company may have incurred a material loss, or a material loss in excess of a recorded accrual, with respect to indemnification of third parties.The Company offers an iPhone Upgrade Program, which is available to customers who purchase a qualifying iPhone in the U.S., the U.K. and mainland China. The iPhone Upgrade Program provides customers the right to trade in that iPhone for a specified amount when purchasing a new iPhone, provided certain conditions are met. The Company accounts for the trade-in right as a guarantee liability and recognizes arrangement revenue net of the fair value of such right, with subsequent changes to the guarantee liability recognized within revenue.The Company has entered into indemnification agreements with its directors and executive officers. Under these agreements, the Company has agreed to indemnify such individuals to the fullest extent permitted by law against liabilities that arise by reason of their status as directors or officers of the Company and to advance expenses incurred by such individuals in connection with related legal proceedings. It is not possible to determine the maximum potential amount of payments the Company could be required to make under these agreements due to the limited history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each claim. While the Company maintains directors and officers liability insurance coverage, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise.Apple Inc. | 2017 Form 10-K | 32



Critical Accounting Policies and EstimatesThe preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) and the Company’s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and operating results require the Company’s management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported in its consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Note 1, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Company’s consolidated financial statements. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. Actual results may differ from these estimates, and such differences may be material.Management believes the Company’s critical accounting policies and estimates are those related to revenue recognition, valuation and impairment of marketable securities, inventory valuation, valuation of manufacturing-related assets and estimation of purchase commitment cancellation fees, warranty costs, income taxes, and legal and other contingencies. Management considers these policies critical because they are both important to the portrayal of the Company’s financial condition and operating results, and they require management to make judgments and estimates about inherently uncertain matters. The Company’s senior management has reviewed these critical accounting policies and related disclosures with the Audit and Finance Committee of the Company’s Board of Directors.Revenue RecognitionNet sales consist primarily of revenue from the sale of hardware, software, digital content and applications, accessories, and service and support contracts. The Company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the sales price is fixed or determinable and collection is probable. Product is considered delivered to the customer once it has been shipped and title, risk of loss and rewards of ownership have been transferred. For most of the Company’s product sales, these criteria are met at the time the product is shipped. For online sales to individuals, for some sales to education customers in the U.S., and for certain other sales, the Company defers revenue until the customer receives the product because the Company retains a portion of the risk of loss on these sales during transit. For payment terms in excess of the Company’s standard payment terms, revenue is recognized as payments become due unless the Company has positive evidence that the sales price is fixed or determinable, such as a successful history of collection, without concession, on comparable arrangements. The Company recognizes revenue from the sale of hardware products, software bundled with hardware that is essential to the functionality of the hardware and third-party digital content sold on the iTunes Store in accordance with general revenue recognition accounting guidance. The Company recognizes revenue in accordance with industry-specific software accounting guidance for the following types of sales transactions: (i) standalone sales of software products, (ii) sales of software upgrades and (iii) sales of software bundled with hardware not essential to the functionality of the hardware.For multi-element arrangements that include hardware products containing software essential to the hardware product’s functionality, undelivered software elements that relate to the hardware product’s essential software and/or undelivered non-software services, the Company allocates revenue to all deliverables based on their relative selling prices. In such circumstances, the Company uses a hierarchy to determine the selling price to be used for allocating revenue to deliverables: (i) vendor-specific objective evidence of fair value (“VSOE”), (ii) third-party evidence of selling price (“TPE”) and (iii) best estimate of selling price (“ESP”). VSOE generally exists only when the Company sells the deliverable separately and is the price actually charged by the Company for that deliverable. ESPs reflect the Company’s best estimates of what the selling prices of elements would be if they were sold regularly on a stand-alone basis.For sales of qualifying versions of iOS devices, Mac, Apple Watch and Apple TV, the Company has indicated it may from time to time provide future unspecified software upgrades to the device’s essential software and/or non-software services free of charge. Because the Company has neither VSOE nor TPE for the unspecified software upgrade rights or the non-software services, revenue is allocated to these rights and services based on the Company’s ESPs. Revenue allocated to the unspecified software upgrade rights and non-software services based on the Company’s ESPs is deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis over the estimated period the software upgrades and non-software services are expected to be provided.The Company’s process for determining ESPs involves management’s judgment and considers multiple factors that may vary over time depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each deliverable. Should future facts and circumstances change, the Company’s ESPs and the future rate of related amortization for unspecified software upgrades and non-software services related to future sales of these devices could change. Factors subject to change include the unspecified software upgrade rights and non-software services offered, the estimated value of unspecified software upgrade rights and non-software services and the estimated period unspecified software upgrades and non-software services are expected to be provided.Apple Inc. | 2017 Form 10-K | 33



The Company records reductions to revenue for estimated commitments related to price protection and other customer incentive programs. For transactions involving price protection, the Company recognizes revenue net of the estimated amount to be refunded, provided the refund amount can be reasonably and reliably estimated and the other conditions for revenue recognition have been met. The Company’s policy requires that, if refunds cannot be reliably estimated, revenue is not recognized until reliable estimates can be made or the price protection lapses. For the Company’s other customer incentive programs, the estimated cost is recognized at the later of the date at which the Company has sold the product or the date at which the program is offered. The Company also records reductions to revenue for expected future product returns based on the Company’s historical experience. Future market conditions and product transitions may require the Company to increase customer incentive programs that could result in reductions to future revenue. Additionally, certain customer incentive programs require management to estimate the number of customers who will actually redeem the incentive. Management’s estimates are based on historical experience and the specific terms and conditions of particular incentive programs. If a greater than estimated proportion of customers redeems such incentives, the Company would be required to record additional reductions to revenue, which would have an adverse impact on the Company’s operating results.Valuation and Impairment of Marketable SecuritiesThe Company’s investments in available-for-sale securities are reported at fair value. Unrealized gains and losses related to changes in the fair value of securities are recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income, net of tax, in the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets. Changes in the fair value of available-for-sale securities impact the Company’s net income only when such securities are sold or an other-than-temporary impairment is recognized. Realized gains and losses on the sale of securities are determined by specific identification of each security’s cost basis. The Company regularly reviews its investment portfolio to determine if any security is other-than-temporarily impaired, which would require the Company to record an impairment charge in the period any such determination is made. In making this determination, the Company evaluates, among other things, the duration and extent to which the fair value of a security is less than its cost; the financial condition of the issuer and any changes thereto; and the Company’s intent to sell, or whether it will more likely than not be required to sell, the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis. The Company’s assessment of whether a security is other-than-temporarily impaired could change in the future due to new developments or changes in assumptions related to any particular security, which would have an adverse impact on the Company’s financial condition and operating results.Inventory Valuation, Valuation of Manufacturing-Related Assets and Estimation of Purchase Commitment Cancellation FeesThe Company must purchase components and build inventory in advance of product shipments and has invested in manufacturing-related assets, including capital assets held at its suppliers’ facilities. In addition, the Company has made prepayments to certain of its suppliers associated with long-term supply agreements to secure supply of inventory components. The Company records a write-down for inventories of components and products, including third-party products held for resale, which have become obsolete or are in excess of anticipated demand or net realizable value. The Company performs a regular review of inventory that considers multiple factors including demand forecasts, product life cycle status, product development plans, current sales levels and component cost trends. The Company also reviews its manufacturing-related capital assets and inventory prepayments for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. If the Company determines that an asset is not recoverable, it records an impairment loss equal to the amount by which the carrying value of such an asset exceeds its fair value.The industries in which the Company competes are subject to a rapid and unpredictable pace of product and component obsolescence and demand changes. In certain circumstances the Company may be required to record additional write-downs of inventory and/or impairments of manufacturing-related assets or inventory prepayments. These circumstances include future demand or market conditions for the Company’s products being less favorable than forecasted, unforeseen technological changes or changes to the Company’s product development plans that negatively impact the utility of any of these assets, or significant deterioration in the financial condition of one or more of the Company’s suppliers that hold any of the Company’s manufacturing-related assets or to whom the Company has made an inventory prepayment. Such write-downs would adversely affect the Company’s financial condition and operating results in the period when the additional write-downs were recorded.The Company accrues for estimated purchase commitment cancellation fees related to inventory orders that have been canceled or are expected to be canceled. Manufacturing purchase obligations typically cover the Company’s forecasted component and manufacturing requirements for periods up to 150 days. If there is an abrupt and substantial decline in demand for one or more of the Company’s products, a change in the Company’s product development plans, or an unanticipated change in technological requirements for any of the Company’s products, the Company may be required to record additional accruals for cancellation fees that would adversely affect its results of operations in the period when the cancellation fees were identified and recorded.Apple Inc. | 2017 Form 10-K | 34



Warranty CostsThe Company accrues for the estimated cost of warranties in the period the related revenue is recognized based on historical and projected warranty claim rates, historical and projected cost per claim and knowledge of specific product failures that are outside of the Company’s typical experience. The Company regularly reviews these estimates and the current installed base of products subject to warranty protection to assess the appropriateness of its recorded warranty liabilities and adjusts the amounts as necessary. If actual product failure rates or repair costs differ from estimates, revisions to the estimated warranty liabilities could be required and could materially affect the Company’s financial condition and operating results.Income TaxesThe Company records a tax provision for the anticipated tax consequences of its reported operating results. The provision for income taxes is computed using the asset and liability method, under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in effect for the years in which those tax assets and liabilities are expected to be realized or settled. The Company records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is believed more likely than not to be realized.The Company recognizes tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement.Management believes it is more likely than not that forecasted income, including income that may be generated as a result of certain tax planning strategies, together with future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, will be sufficient to fully recover the Company’s deferred tax assets. In the event that the Company determines all or part of its net deferred tax assets are not realizable in the future, the Company will record an adjustment to the valuation allowance that would be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made. In addition, the calculation of tax liabilities involves significant judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of GAAP and complex tax laws. Resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with management’s expectations could have a material impact on the Company’s financial condition and operating results.Legal and Other ContingenciesAs discussed in Part I, Item 3 of this Form 10-K under the heading “Legal Proceedings” and in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Note 10, “Commitments and Contingencies,” the Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business. The Company records a liability when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable, the determination of which requires significant judgment. In the opinion of management, there was not at least a reasonable possibility the Company may have incurred a material loss, or a material loss in excess of a recorded accrual, with respect to loss contingencies for asserted legal and other claims. However, the outcome of legal proceedings and claims brought against the Company is subject to significant uncertainty. Therefore, although management considers the likelihood of such an outcome to be remote, if one or more of these legal matters were resolved against the Company in a reporting period for amounts in excess of management’s expectations, the Company’s consolidated financial statements for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected.Apple Inc. | 2017 Form 10-K | 35


## Item 7A


To provide a meaningful assessment of the foreign currency risk associated with certain of the Company’s foreign currency derivative positions, the Company performed a sensitivity analysis using a value-at-risk (“VAR”) model to assess the potential impact of fluctuations in exchange rates. The VAR model consisted of using a Monte Carlo simulation to generate thousands of random market price paths assuming normal market conditions. The VAR is the maximum expected loss in fair value, for a given confidence interval, to the Company’s foreign currency derivative positions due to adverse movements in rates. The VAR model is not intended to represent actual losses but is used as a risk estimation and management tool. Forecasted transactions, firm commitments and assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies were excluded from the model. Based on the results of the model, the Company estimates with 95% confidence, a maximum one-day loss in fair value of $485 million as of September 30, 2017 compared to a maximum one-day loss in fair value of $434 million as of September 24, 2016. Because the Company uses foreign currency instruments for hedging purposes, the loss in fair value incurred on those instruments are generally offset by increases in the fair value of the underlying exposures.Actual future gains and losses associated with the Company’s investment portfolio and derivative positions may differ materially from the sensitivity analyses performed as of September 30, 2017 due to the inherent limitations associated with predicting the timing and amount of changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and the Company’s actual exposures and positions.Apple Inc. | 2017 Form 10-K | 37

Apple Inc.Notes to Consolidated Financial StatementsNote 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting PoliciesApple Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries (collectively “Apple” or the “Company”) designs, manufactures and markets mobile communication and media devices and personal computers, and sells a variety of related software, services, accessories, networking solutions and third-party digital content and applications. The Company’s products and services include iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple Watch, Apple TV, a portfolio of consumer and professional software applications, iOS, macOS, watchOS and tvOS operating systems, iCloud, Apple Pay and a variety of accessory, service and support offerings. The Company sells and delivers digital content and applications through the iTunes Store, App Store, Mac App Store, TV App Store, iBooks Store and Apple Music (collectively “Digital Content and Services”). The Company sells its products worldwide through its retail stores, online stores and direct sales force, as well as through third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers and value-added resellers. In addition, the Company sells a variety of third-party Apple-compatible products, including application software and various accessories through its retail and online stores. The Company sells to consumers, small and mid-sized businesses and education, enterprise and government customers.Basis of Presentation and PreparationThe accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company. Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. In the opinion of the Company’s management, the consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments, which are normal and recurring in nature, necessary for fair financial statement presentation. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in these consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates. Certain prior period amounts in the consolidated financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the current period’s presentation.The Company’s fiscal year is the 52 or 53-week period that ends on the last Saturday of September. The Company’s fiscal year 2017 included 53 weeks and ended on September 30, 2017. A 14th week was included in the first fiscal quarter of 2017, as is done every five or six years, to realign the Company’s fiscal quarters with calendar quarters. The Company’s fiscal years 2016 and 2015 ended on September 24, 2016 and September 26, 2015, respectively, and spanned 52 weeks each. Unless otherwise stated, references to particular years, quarters, months and periods refer to the Company’s fiscal years ended in September and the associated quarters, months and periods of those fiscal years.Revenue RecognitionNet sales consist primarily of revenue from the sale of hardware, software, digital content and applications, accessories, and service and support contracts. The Company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the sales price is fixed or determinable and collection is probable. Product is considered delivered to the customer once it has been shipped and title, risk of loss and rewards of ownership have been transferred. For most of the Company’s product sales, these criteria are met at the time the product is shipped. For online sales to individuals, for some sales to education customers in the U.S., and for certain other sales, the Company defers revenue until the customer receives the product because the Company retains a portion of the risk of loss on these sales during transit. For payment terms in excess of the Company’s standard payment terms, revenue is recognized as payments become due unless the Company has positive evidence that the sales price is fixed or determinable, such as a successful history of collection, without concession, on comparable arrangements. The Company recognizes revenue from the sale of hardware products, software bundled with hardware that is essential to the functionality of the hardware and third-party digital content sold on the iTunes Store in accordance with general revenue recognition accounting guidance. The Company recognizes revenue in accordance with industry-specific software accounting guidance for the following types of sales transactions: (i) standalone sales of software products, (ii) sales of software upgrades and (iii) sales of software bundled with hardware not essential to the functionality of the hardware.For the sale of most third-party products, the Company recognizes revenue based on the gross amount billed to customers because the Company establishes its own pricing for such products, retains related inventory risk for physical products, is the primary obligor to the customer and assumes the credit risk for amounts billed to its customers. For third-party applications sold through the App Store and Mac App Store and certain digital content sold through the iTunes Store, the Company does not determine the selling price of the products and is not the primary obligor to the customer. Therefore, the Company accounts for such sales on a net basis by recognizing in net sales only the commission it retains from each sale. The portion of the gross amount billed to customers that is remitted by the Company to third-party app developers and certain digital content owners is not reflected in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Operations.Apple Inc. | 2017 Form 10-K | 44



The Company records deferred revenue when it receives payments in advance of the delivery of products or the performance of services. This includes amounts that have been deferred for unspecified and specified software upgrade rights and non-software services that are attached to hardware and software products. The Company sells gift cards redeemable at its retail and online stores, and also sells gift cards redeemable on iTunes Store, App Store, Mac App Store, TV App Store and iBooks Store for the purchase of digital content and software. The Company records deferred revenue upon the sale of the card, which is relieved upon redemption of the card by the customer. Revenue from AppleCare service and support contracts is deferred and recognized over the service coverage periods. AppleCare service and support contracts typically include extended phone support, repair services, web-based support resources and diagnostic tools offered under the Company’s standard limited warranty.The Company records reductions to revenue for estimated commitments related to price protection and other customer incentive programs. For transactions involving price protection, the Company recognizes revenue net of the estimated amount to be refunded. For the Company’s other customer incentive programs, the estimated cost of these programs is recognized at the later of the date at which the Company has sold the product or the date at which the program is offered. The Company also records reductions to revenue for expected future product returns based on the Company’s historical experience. Revenue is recorded net of taxes collected from customers that are remitted to governmental authorities, with the collected taxes recorded as current liabilities until remitted to the relevant government authority.Revenue Recognition for Arrangements with Multiple DeliverablesFor multi-element arrangements that include hardware products containing software essential to the hardware product’s functionality, undelivered software elements that relate to the hardware product’s essential software, and undelivered non-software services, the Company allocates revenue to all deliverables based on their relative selling prices. In such circumstances, the Company uses a hierarchy to determine the selling price to be used for allocating revenue to deliverables: (i) vendor-specific objective evidence of fair value (“VSOE”), (ii) third-party evidence of selling price (“TPE”) and (iii) best estimate of selling price (“ESP”). VSOE generally exists only when the Company sells the deliverable separately and is the price actually charged by the Company for that deliverable. ESPs reflect the Company’s best estimates of what the selling prices of elements would be if they were sold regularly on a stand-alone basis. For multi-element arrangements accounted for in accordance with industry-specific software accounting guidance, the Company allocates revenue to all deliverables based on the VSOE of each element, and if VSOE does not exist revenue is recognized when elements lacking VSOE are delivered.For sales of qualifying versions of iPhone, iPad, iPod touch, Mac, Apple Watch and Apple TV, the Company has indicated it may from time to time provide future unspecified software upgrades to the device’s essential software and/or non-software services free of charge. The Company has identified up to three deliverables regularly included in arrangements involving the sale of these devices. The first deliverable, which represents the substantial portion of the allocated sales price, is the hardware and software essential to the functionality of the hardware device delivered at the time of sale. The second deliverable is the embedded right included with qualifying devices to receive, on a when-and-if-available basis, future unspecified software upgrades relating to the product’s essential software. The third deliverable is the non-software services to be provided to qualifying devices. The Company allocates revenue between these deliverables using the relative selling price method. Because the Company has neither VSOE nor TPE for these deliverables, the allocation of revenue is based on the Company’s ESPs. Revenue allocated to the delivered hardware and the related essential software is recognized at the time of sale, provided the other conditions for revenue recognition have been met. Revenue allocated to the embedded unspecified software upgrade rights and the non-software services is deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis over the estimated period the software upgrades and non-software services are expected to be provided. Cost of sales related to delivered hardware and related essential software, including estimated warranty costs, are recognized at the time of sale. Costs incurred to provide non-software services are recognized as cost of sales as incurred, and engineering and sales and marketing costs are recognized as operating expenses as incurred.The Company’s process for determining its ESP for deliverables without VSOE or TPE considers multiple factors that may vary depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each deliverable including, where applicable, prices charged by the Company and market trends in the pricing for similar offerings, product-specific business objectives, estimated cost to provide the non-software services and the relative ESP of the upgrade rights and non-software services as compared to the total selling price of the product.Shipping CostsAmounts billed to customers related to shipping and handling are classified as revenue, and the Company’s shipping and handling costs are classified as cost of sales.Warranty CostsThe Company generally provides for the estimated cost of hardware and software warranties in the period the related revenue is recognized. The Company assesses the adequacy of its accrued warranty liabilities and adjusts the amounts as necessary based on actual experience and changes in future estimates.Apple Inc. | 2017 Form 10-K | 45



Software Development CostsResearch and development (“R&D”) costs are expensed as incurred. Development costs of computer software to be sold, leased, or otherwise marketed are subject to capitalization beginning when a product’s technological feasibility has been established and ending when a product is available for general release to customers. In most instances, the Company’s products are released soon after technological feasibility has been established and as a result software development costs were expensed as incurred.Advertising CostsAdvertising costs are expensed as incurred and included in selling, general and administrative expenses.Share-based CompensationThe Company recognizes expense related to share-based payment transactions in which it receives employee services in exchange for (a) equity instruments of the Company or (b) liabilities that are based on the fair value of the Company’s equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of such equity instruments. Share-based compensation expense for restricted stock units (“RSUs”) and restricted stock is measured based on the closing fair market value of the Company’s common stock on the date of grant. The Company estimates forfeitures expected to occur and recognizes share-based compensation expense for those equity awards expected to vest. The Company recognizes share-based compensation expense over the award’s requisite service period on a straight-line basis for time-based RSUs and on a graded basis for RSUs that are contingent on the achievement of performance conditions. The Company recognizes a benefit from share-based compensation in the Consolidated Statements of Shareholders’ Equity if an excess tax benefit is realized. In addition, the Company recognizes the indirect effects of share-based compensation on R&D tax credits, foreign tax credits and domestic manufacturing deductions in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Further information regarding share-based compensation can be found in Note 9, “Benefit Plans.”Income TaxesThe provision for income taxes is computed using the asset and liability method, under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in effect for the years in which those tax assets and liabilities are expected to be realized or settled. The Company records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is believed more likely than not to be realized.The Company recognizes the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon settlement. See Note 5, “Income Taxes” for additional information.Earnings Per ShareBasic earnings per share is computed by dividing income available to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share is computed by dividing income available to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period increased to include the number of additional shares of common stock that would have been outstanding if the potentially dilutive securities had been issued. Potentially dilutive securities include unvested RSUs, unvested restricted stock, outstanding stock options and shares to be purchased by employees under the Company’s employee stock purchase plan. The dilutive effect of potentially dilutive securities is reflected in diluted earnings per share by application of the treasury stock method. Under the treasury stock method, an increase in the fair market value of the Company’s common stock can result in a greater dilutive effect from potentially dilutive securities.Apple Inc. | 2017 Form 10-K | 46

The Company’s marketable debt and equity securities have been classified and accounted for as available-for-sale. Management determines the appropriate classification of its investments at the time of purchase and reevaluates the classifications at each balance sheet date. The Company classifies its marketable debt securities as either short-term or long-term based on each instrument’s underlying contractual maturity date. Marketable debt securities with maturities of 12 months or less are classified as short-term and marketable debt securities with maturities greater than 12 months are classified as long-term. Marketable equity securities, including mutual funds, are classified as either short-term or long-term based on the nature of each security and its availability for use in current operations. The Company’s marketable debt and equity securities are carried at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses, net of taxes, reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss) (“AOCI”) in shareholders’ equity, with the exception of unrealized losses believed to be other-than-temporary which are reported in earnings in the current period. The cost of securities sold is based upon the specific identification method.Derivative Financial InstrumentsThe Company accounts for its derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities and carries them at fair value.For derivative instruments that hedge the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows that are designated as cash flow hedges, the effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative instrument is reported as a component of AOCI in shareholders’ equity and reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. The ineffective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative instrument, if any, is recognized in earnings in the current period. To receive hedge accounting treatment, cash flow hedges must be highly effective in offsetting changes to expected future cash flows on hedged transactions. For options designated as cash flow hedges, changes in the time value are excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and are recognized in earnings.For derivative instruments that hedge the exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset or a liability and that are designated as fair value hedges, both the net gain or loss on the derivative instrument as well as the offsetting gain or loss on the hedged item are recognized in earnings in the current period.For derivative instruments and foreign currency debt that hedge the exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates used for translation of the net investment in a foreign operation and that are designated as a net investment hedge, the net gain or loss on the effective portion of the derivative instrument is reported in the same manner as a foreign currency translation adjustment. For forward exchange contracts designated as net investment hedges, the Company excludes changes in fair value relating to changes in the forward carry component from its definition of effectiveness. Accordingly, any gains or losses related to this forward carry component are recognized in earnings in the current period.Derivatives that do not qualify as hedges are adjusted to fair value through earnings in the current period.Apple Inc. | 2017 Form 10-K | 47



Allowance for Doubtful AccountsThe Company records its allowance for doubtful accounts based upon its assessment of various factors, including historical experience, age of the accounts receivable balances, credit quality of the Company’s customers, current economic conditions and other factors that may affect the customers’ abilities to pay.InventoriesInventories are stated at the lower of cost, computed using the first-in, first-out method, and net realizable value. Any adjustments to reduce the cost of inventories to their net realizable value are recognized in earnings in the current period.Property, Plant and EquipmentProperty, plant and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation is computed by use of the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which for buildings is the lesser of 30 years or the remaining life of the underlying building; between one and five years for machinery and equipment, including product tooling and manufacturing process equipment; and the shorter of lease term or useful life for leasehold improvements. The Company capitalizes eligible costs to acquire or develop internal-use software that are incurred subsequent to the preliminary project stage. Capitalized costs related to internal-use software are amortized using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which range from three to five years. Depreciation and amortization expense on property and equipment was $8.2 billion, $8.3 billion and $9.2 billion during 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.Long-Lived Assets Including Goodwill and Other Acquired Intangible AssetsThe Company reviews property, plant and equipment, inventory component prepayments and identifiable intangibles, excluding goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives, for impairment. Long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of these assets is measured by comparison of their carrying amounts to future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate. If property, plant and equipment, inventory component prepayments and certain identifiable intangibles are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized equals the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value.The Company does not amortize goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives; rather, such assets are required to be tested for impairment at least annually or sooner if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the assets may be impaired. The Company performs its goodwill and intangible asset impairment tests in the fourth quarter of each year. The Company did not recognize any impairment charges related to goodwill or indefinite lived intangible assets during 2017, 2016 and 2015. For purposes of testing goodwill for impairment, the Company established reporting units based on its current reporting structure. Goodwill has been allocated to these reporting units to the extent it relates to each reporting unit. In 2017 and 2016, the Company’s goodwill was primarily allocated to the Americas and Europe reporting units.The Company amortizes its intangible assets with definite useful lives over their estimated useful lives and reviews these assets for impairment. The Company typically amortizes its acquired intangible assets with definite useful lives over periods from three to seven years.Fair Value MeasurementsThe Company applies fair value accounting for all financial assets and liabilities and non-financial assets and liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis. The Company defines fair value as the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. When determining the fair value measurements for assets and liabilities that are required to be recorded at fair value, the Company considers the principal or most advantageous market in which the Company would transact and the market-based risk measurements or assumptions that market participants would use to price the asset or liability, such as risks inherent in valuation techniques, transfer restrictions and credit risk. Fair value is estimated by applying the following hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value into three levels and bases the categorization within the hierarchy upon the lowest level of input that is available and significant to the fair value measurement:Level 1 – Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.Level 2 – Observable inputs other than quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in inactive markets, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.Level 3 – Inputs that are generally unobservable and typically reflect management’s estimate of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability.Apple Inc. | 2017 Form 10-K | 48

The Company’s valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of money market funds and certain marketable equity securities were derived from quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. The valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of the Company’s debt instruments and all other financial instruments, all of which have counterparties with high credit ratings, were valued based on quoted market prices or model-driven valuations using significant inputs derived from or corroborated by observable market data.In accordance with the fair value accounting requirements, companies may choose to measure eligible financial instruments and certain other items at fair value. The Company has not elected the fair value option for any eligible financial instruments.Foreign Currency Translation and RemeasurementThe Company translates the assets and liabilities of its non-U.S. dollar functional currency subsidiaries into U.S. dollars using exchange rates in effect at the end of each period. Revenue and expenses for these subsidiaries are translated using rates that approximate those in effect during the period. Gains and losses from these translations are recognized in foreign currency translation included in AOCI in shareholders’ equity. The Company’s subsidiaries that use the U.S. dollar as their functional currency remeasure monetary assets and liabilities at exchange rates in effect at the end of each period, and inventories, property and nonmonetary assets and liabilities at historical rates.Note 2 – Financial InstrumentsCash, Cash Equivalents and Marketable SecuritiesThe following tables show the Company’s cash and available-for-sale securities by significant investment category as of September 30, 2017 and September 24, 2016 (in millions):Apple Inc. | 2017 Form 10-K | 49

The Company may sell certain of its marketable securities prior to their stated maturities for strategic reasons including, but not limited to, anticipation of credit deterioration and duration management. The maturities of the Company’s long-term marketable securities generally range from one to five years.The Company considers the declines in market value of its marketable securities investment portfolio to be temporary in nature. The Company typically invests in highly-rated securities, and its investment policy generally limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. The policy generally requires investments to be investment grade, with the primary objective of minimizing the potential risk of principal loss. Fair values were determined for each individual security in the investment portfolio. When evaluating an investment for other-than-temporary impairment, the Company reviews factors such as the length of time and extent to which fair value has been below its cost basis, the financial condition of the issuer and any changes thereto, changes in market interest rates and the Company’s intent to sell, or whether it is more likely than not it will be required to sell the investment before recovery of the investment’s cost basis. As of September 30, 2017, the Company does not consider any of its investments to be other-than-temporarily impaired.Derivative Financial InstrumentsThe Company may use derivatives to partially offset its business exposure to foreign currency and interest rate risk on expected future cash flows, on net investments in certain foreign subsidiaries and on certain existing assets and liabilities. However, the Company may choose not to hedge certain exposures for a variety of reasons including, but not limited to, accounting considerations and the prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures. There can be no assurance the hedges will offset more than a portion of the financial impact resulting from movements in foreign currency exchange or interest rates.To help protect gross margins from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, certain of the Company’s subsidiaries whose functional currency is the U.S. dollar may hedge a portion of forecasted foreign currency revenue, and subsidiaries whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar and who sell in local currencies may hedge a portion of forecasted inventory purchases not denominated in the subsidiaries’ functional currencies. The Company may enter into forward contracts, option contracts or other instruments to manage this risk and may designate these instruments as cash flow hedges. The Company typically hedges portions of its forecasted foreign currency exposure associated with revenue and inventory purchases, typically for up to 12 months.To help protect the net investment in a foreign operation from adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates, the Company may enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts to offset the changes in the carrying amounts of these investments due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. In addition, the Company may use non-derivative financial instruments, such as its foreign currency-denominated debt, as economic hedges of its net investments in certain foreign subsidiaries. In both of these cases, the Company designates these instruments as net investment hedges.Apple Inc. | 2017 Form 10-K | 50

The Company may also enter into non-designated foreign currency contracts to partially offset the foreign currency exchange gains and losses generated by the remeasurement of certain assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies.The Company may enter into interest rate swaps, options, or other instruments to manage interest rate risk. These instruments may offset a portion of changes in income or expense, or changes in fair value of the Company’s term debt or investments. The Company designates these instruments as either cash flow or fair value hedges. The Company’s hedged interest rate transactions as of September 30, 2017 are expected to be recognized within 10 years.The Company may enter into foreign currency swaps to manage currency risk on its foreign currency-denominated term debt. These instruments may offset a portion of the foreign currency remeasurement gains or losses on the Company’s term debt and related interest payments. The Company designates these instruments as cash flow hedges. The Company’s hedged term debt-related foreign currency transactions as of September 30, 2017 are expected to be recognized within 25 years.Cash Flow HedgesThe effective portions of cash flow hedges are recorded in AOCI until the hedged item is recognized in earnings. Deferred gains and losses associated with cash flow hedges of foreign currency revenue are recognized as a component of net sales in the same period as the related revenue is recognized, and deferred gains and losses related to cash flow hedges of inventory purchases are recognized as a component of cost of sales in the same period as the related costs are recognized. Deferred gains and losses associated with cash flow hedges of interest income or expense are recognized in other income/(expense), net in the same period as the related income or expense is recognized. The ineffective portions and amounts excluded from the effectiveness testing of cash flow hedges are recognized in other income/(expense), net.Derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges must be de-designated as hedges when it is probable the forecasted hedged transaction will not occur in the initially identified time period or within a subsequent two-month time period. Deferred gains and losses in AOCI associated with such derivative instruments are reclassified into other income/(expense), net in the period of de-designation. Any subsequent changes in fair value of such derivative instruments are reflected in other income/(expense), net unless they are re-designated as hedges of other transactions.Net Investment HedgesThe effective portions of net investment hedges are recorded in other comprehensive income/(loss) (“OCI”) as a part of the cumulative translation adjustment. The ineffective portions and amounts excluded from the effectiveness testing of net investment hedges are recognized in other income/(expense), net.Fair Value HedgesGains and losses related to changes in fair value hedges are recognized in earnings along with a corresponding loss or gain related to the change in value of the underlying hedged item.Non-Designated DerivativesDerivatives that are not designated as hedging instruments are adjusted to fair value through earnings in the financial statement line item to which the derivative relates. As a result, the Company recognized a gain of $20 million in net sales, a loss of $40 million in cost of sales and a gain of $606 million in other income/(expense), net for 2017.The Company records all derivatives in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value. The Company’s accounting treatment for these derivative instruments is based on its hedge designation.

The following table shows the notional amounts of the Company’s outstanding derivative instruments and credit risk amounts associated with outstanding or unsettled derivative instruments as of September 30, 2017 and September 24, 2016 (in millions):The notional amounts for outstanding derivative instruments provide one measure of the transaction volume outstanding and do not represent the amount of the Company’s exposure to credit or market loss. The credit risk amounts represent the Company’s gross exposure to potential accounting loss on derivative instruments that are outstanding or unsettled if all counterparties failed to perform according to the terms of the contract, based on then-current currency or interest rates at each respective date. The Company’s exposure to credit loss and market risk will vary over time as currency and interest rates change. Although the table above reflects the notional and credit risk amounts of the Company’s derivative instruments, it does not reflect the gains or losses associated with the exposures and transactions that the instruments are intended to hedge. The amounts ultimately realized upon settlement of these financial instruments, together with the gains and losses on the underlying exposures, will depend on actual market conditions during the remaining life of the instruments.The Company generally enters into master netting arrangements, which are designed to reduce credit risk by permitting net settlement of transactions with the same counterparty. To further limit credit risk, the Company generally enters into collateral security arrangements that provide for collateral to be received or posted when the net fair value of certain financial instruments fluctuates from contractually established thresholds. The Company presents its derivative assets and derivative liabilities at their gross fair values in its Consolidated Balance Sheets. The net cash collateral received by the Company related to derivative instruments under its collateral security arrangements was $35 million and $163 million as of September 30, 2017 and September 24, 2016, respectively, which were recorded as accrued expenses in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.Under master netting arrangements with the respective counterparties to the Company’s derivative contracts, the Company is allowed to net settle transactions with a single net amount payable by one party to the other. As of September 30, 2017 and September 24, 2016, the potential effects of these rights of set-off associated with the Company’s derivative contracts, including the effects of collateral, would be a reduction to both derivative assets and derivative liabilities of $1.4 billion and $1.5 billion, respectively, resulting in net derivative assets of $32 million and $160 million, respectively.Accounts ReceivableTrade ReceivablesThe Company has considerable trade receivables outstanding with its third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers, value-added resellers, small and mid-sized businesses and education, enterprise and government customers. The Company generally does not require collateral from its customers; however, the Company will require collateral in certain instances to limit credit risk. In addition, when possible, the Company attempts to limit credit risk on trade receivables with credit insurance for certain customers or by requiring third-party financing, loans or leases to support credit exposure. These credit-financing arrangements are directly between the third-party financing company and the end customer. As such, the Company generally does not assume any recourse or credit risk sharing related to any of these arrangements.As of September 30, 2017, the Company had two customers that individually represented 10% or more of total trade receivables, each of which accounted for 10%. As of September 24, 2016, the Company had one customer that represented 10% or more of total trade receivables, which accounted for 10%. The Company’s cellular network carriers accounted for 59% and 63% of trade receivables as of September 30, 2017 and September 24, 2016, respectively.Vendor Non-Trade ReceivablesThe Company has non-trade receivables from certain of its manufacturing vendors resulting from the sale of components to these vendors who manufacture sub-assemblies or assemble final products for the Company. The Company purchases these components directly from suppliers. As of September 30, 2017, the Company had three vendors that individually represented 10% or more of total vendor non-trade receivables, which accounted for 42%, 19% and 10%. As of September 24, 2016, the Company had two vendors that individually represented 10% or more of total vendor non-trade receivables, which accounted for 47% and 21%.Apple Inc. | 2017 Form 10-K | 53

Amortization expense related to acquired intangible assets was $1.2 billion, $1.5 billion and $1.3 billion in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. As of September 30, 2017, the remaining weighted-average amortization period for acquired intangible assets is 3.4 years. The expected annual amortization expense related to acquired intangible assets as of September 30, 2017, is as follows (in millions):Note 5 – Income TaxesThe provision for income taxes for 2017, 2016 and 2015, consisted of the following (in millions):The foreign provision for income taxes is based on foreign pre-tax earnings of $44.7 billion, $41.1 billion and $47.6 billion in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The Company’s consolidated financial statements provide for any related tax liability on undistributed earnings that the Company does not intend to be indefinitely reinvested outside the U.S. Substantially all of the Company’s undistributed international earnings intended to be indefinitely reinvested in operations outside the U.S. were generated by subsidiaries organized in Ireland, which has a statutory tax rate of 12.5%. As of September 30, 2017, U.S. income taxes have not been provided on a cumulative total of $128.7 billion of such earnings. The amount of unrecognized deferred tax liability related to these temporary differences is estimated to be $42.2 billion.As of September 30, 2017 and September 24, 2016, $252.3 billion and $216.0 billion, respectively, of the Company’s cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities were held by foreign subsidiaries and are generally based in U.S. dollar-denominated holdings. Amounts held by foreign subsidiaries are generally subject to U.S. income taxation on repatriation to the U.S.Apple Inc. | 2017 Form 10-K | 55

A reconciliation of the provision for income taxes, with the amount computed by applying the statutory federal income tax rate (35% in 2017, 2016 and 2015) to income before provision for income taxes for 2017, 2016 and 2015, is as follows (dollars in millions):The Company’s income taxes payable have been reduced by the tax benefits from employee stock plan awards. For RSUs, the Company receives an income tax benefit upon the award’s vesting equal to the tax effect of the underlying stock’s fair market value. The Company had net excess tax benefits from equity awards of $620 million, $379 million and $748 million in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively, which were reflected as increases to common stock.As of September 30, 2017 and September 24, 2016, the significant components of the Company’s deferred tax assets and liabilities were (in millions):Deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect the effects of tax losses, credits and the future income tax effects of temporary differences between the consolidated financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and are measured using enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.Uncertain Tax PositionsTax positions are evaluated in a two-step process. The Company first determines whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination. If a tax position meets the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold it is then measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements. The tax position is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. The Company classifies gross interest and penalties and unrecognized tax benefits that are not expected to result in payment or receipt of cash within one year as non-current liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.As of September 30, 2017, the total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits was $8.4 billion, of which $2.5 billion, if recognized, would affect the Company’s effective tax rate. As of September 24, 2016, the total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits was $7.7 billion, of which $2.8 billion, if recognized, would have affected the Company’s effective tax rate.Apple Inc. | 2017 Form 10-K | 56

The aggregate changes in the balance of gross unrecognized tax benefits, which excludes interest and penalties, for 2017, 2016 and 2015, is as follows (in millions):The Company includes interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within the provision for income taxes. As of September 30, 2017 and September 24, 2016, the total amount of gross interest and penalties accrued was $1.2 billion and $1.0 billion, respectively, which is classified as non-current liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. In connection with tax matters, the Company recognized interest and penalty expense in 2017, 2016 and 2015 of $165 million, $295 million and $709 million, respectively.The Company is subject to taxation and files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and in many state and foreign jurisdictions. The U.S. Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”) concluded its review of the years 2010 through 2012 during the third quarter of 2017. All years prior to 2013 are closed, and the IRS is currently examining the years 2013 through 2015. The Company is also subject to audits by state, local and foreign tax authorities. In major states and major foreign jurisdictions, the years subsequent to 2003 generally remain open and could be subject to examination by the taxing authorities.The Company believes that an adequate provision has been made for any adjustments that may result from tax examinations. However, the outcome of tax audits cannot be predicted with certainty. If any issues addressed in the Company’s tax audits are resolved in a manner not consistent with its expectations, the Company could be required to adjust its provision for income taxes in the period such resolution occurs. Although timing of the resolution and/or closure of audits is not certain, the Company does not believe it is reasonably possible that its gross unrecognized tax benefits would materially change in the next 12 months.On August 30, 2016, the European Commission announced its decision that Ireland granted state aid to the Company by providing tax opinions in 1991 and 2007 concerning the tax allocation of profits of the Irish branches of two subsidiaries of the Company (the “State Aid Decision”). The State Aid Decision orders Ireland to calculate and recover additional taxes from the Company for the period June 2003 through December 2014. Irish legislative changes, effective as of January 2015, eliminated the application of the tax opinions from that date forward. The Company believes the State Aid Decision to be without merit and appealed to the General Court of the Court of Justice of the European Union. Ireland has also appealed the State Aid Decision. Although Ireland is still computing the recovery amount, the Company expects the amount to be in line with the European Commission’s announced recovery amount of €13 billion, plus interest of €1 billion. Once the recovery amount is finalized by Ireland, the Company anticipates funding it, including interest, out of foreign cash. These amounts are expected to be placed into escrow in 2018, where they will remain pending conclusion of all appeals. The Company believes that any incremental Irish corporate income taxes potentially due related to the State Aid Decision would be creditable against U.S. taxes.Apple Inc. | 2017 Form 10-K | 57

To manage interest rate risk on certain of its U.S. dollar-denominated fixed- or floating-rate notes, the Company has entered into interest rate swaps to effectively convert the fixed interest rates to floating interest rates or the floating interest rates to fixed interest rates on a portion of these notes. Additionally, to manage foreign currency risk on certain of its foreign currency-denominated notes, the Company has entered into foreign currency swaps to effectively convert these notes to U.S. dollar-denominated notes.A portion of the Company’s Japanese yen-denominated notes is designated as a hedge of the foreign currency exposure of the Company’s net investment in a foreign operation. As of September 30, 2017 and September 24, 2016, the carrying value of the debt designated as a net investment hedge was $1.6 billion and $1.9 billion, respectively.

The effective interest rates for the Notes include the interest on the Notes, amortization of the discount or premium and, if applicable, adjustments related to hedging. The Company recognized $2.2 billion, $1.4 billion and $722 million of interest expense on its term debt for 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.The future principal payments for the Company’s Notes as of September 30, 2017 are as follows (in millions):As of September 30, 2017 and September 24, 2016, the fair value of the Company’s Notes, based on Level 2 inputs, was $106.1 billion and $81.7 billion, respectively.Note 7 – Shareholders’ EquityDividendsThe Company declared and paid cash dividends per share during the periods presented as follows:Future dividends are subject to declaration by the Board of Directors.Share Repurchase ProgramIn May 2017, the Company’s Board of Directors increased the share repurchase authorization from $175 billion to $210 billion of the Company’s common stock, of which $166 billion had been utilized as of September 30, 2017. The Company’s share repurchase program does not obligate it to acquire any specific number of shares. Under the program, shares may be repurchased in privately negotiated and/or open market transactions, including under plans complying with Rule 10b5-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”).The Company has entered, and in the future may enter, into accelerated share repurchase arrangements (“ASRs”) with financial institutions. In exchange for up-front payments, the financial institutions deliver shares of the Company’s common stock during the purchase periods of each ASR. The total number of shares ultimately delivered, and therefore the average repurchase price paid per share, is determined at the end of the applicable purchase period of each ASR based on the volume-weighted average price of the Company’s common stock during that period. The shares received are retired in the periods they are delivered, and the up-front payments are accounted for as a reduction to shareholders’ equity in the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets in the periods the payments are made. The Company reflects the ASRs as a repurchase of common stock in the period delivered for purposes of calculating earnings per share and as forward contracts indexed to its own common stock. The ASRs met all of the applicable criteria for equity classification, and therefore were not accounted for as derivative instruments.Apple Inc. | 2017 Form 10-K | 60

The following table shows the Company’s ASR activity and related information during the years ended September 30, 2017 and September 24, 2016: Additionally, the Company repurchased shares of its common stock in the open market, which were retired upon repurchase, during the periods presented as follows:Note 8 – Comprehensive IncomeComprehensive income consists of two components, net income and OCI. OCI refers to revenue, expenses, and gains and losses that under GAAP are recorded as an element of shareholders’ equity but are excluded from net income. The Company’s OCI consists of foreign currency translation adjustments from those subsidiaries not using the U.S. dollar as their functional currency, net deferred gains and losses on certain derivative instruments accounted for as cash flow hedges and unrealized gains and losses on marketable securities classified as available-for-sale.Apple Inc. | 2017 Form 10-K | 61

The following table shows the pre-tax amounts reclassified from AOCI into the Consolidated Statements of Operations, and the associated financial statement line item, for 2017 and 2016 (in millions):The following table shows the changes in AOCI by component for 2017 and 2016 (in millions):Note 9 – Benefit Plans2014 Employee Stock PlanIn the second quarter of 2014, shareholders approved the 2014 Employee Stock Plan (the “2014 Plan”) and terminated the Company’s authority to grant new awards under the 2003 Employee Stock Plan (the “2003 Plan”). The 2014 Plan provides for broad-based equity grants to employees, including executive officers, and permits the granting of RSUs, stock grants, performance-based awards, stock options and stock appreciation rights, as well as cash bonus awards. RSUs granted under the 2014 Plan generally vest over four years, based on continued employment, and are settled upon vesting in shares of the Company’s common stock on a one-for-one basis. Each share issued with respect to RSUs granted under the 2014 Plan reduces the number of shares available for grant under the plan by two shares. RSUs canceled and shares withheld to satisfy tax withholding obligations increase the number of shares available for grant under the 2014 Plan utilizing a factor of two times the number of RSUs canceled or shares withheld. Currently, all RSUs granted under the 2014 Plan have dividend equivalent rights (“DERs”), which entitle holders of RSUs to the same dividend value per share as holders of common stock. DERs are subject to the same vesting and other terms and conditions as the corresponding unvested RSUs. DERs are accumulated and paid when the underlying shares vest. Upon approval of the 2014 Plan, the Company reserved 385 million shares plus the number of shares remaining that were reserved but not issued under the 2003 Plan. Shares subject to outstanding awards under the 2003 Plan that expire, are canceled or otherwise terminate, or are withheld to satisfy tax withholding obligations with respect to RSUs, will also be available for awards under the 2014 Plan. As of September 30, 2017, approximately 327.9 million shares were reserved for future issuance under the 2014 Plan.Apple Inc. | 2017 Form 10-K | 62



2003 Employee Stock PlanThe 2003 Plan is a shareholder approved plan that provided for broad-based equity grants to employees, including executive officers. The 2003 Plan permitted the granting of incentive stock options, nonstatutory stock options, RSUs, stock appreciation rights, stock purchase rights and performance-based awards. Options granted under the 2003 Plan generally expire seven to ten years after the grant date and generally become exercisable over a period of four years, based on continued employment, with either annual, semi-annual or quarterly vesting. RSUs granted under the 2003 Plan generally vest over two to four years, based on continued employment and are settled upon vesting in shares of the Company’s common stock on a one-for-one basis. All RSUs, other than RSUs held by the Chief Executive Officer, granted under the 2003 Plan have DERs. DERs are subject to the same vesting and other terms and conditions as the corresponding unvested RSUs. DERs are accumulated and paid when the underlying shares vest. In the second quarter of 2014, the Company terminated the authority to grant new awards under the 2003 Plan.1997 Director Stock PlanThe 1997 Director Stock Plan (the “Director Plan”) is a shareholder approved plan that (i) permits the Company to grant awards of RSUs or stock options to the Company’s non-employee directors, (ii) provides for automatic initial grants of RSUs upon a non-employee director joining the Board of Directors and automatic annual grants of RSUs at each annual meeting of shareholders, and (iii) permits the Board of Directors to prospectively change the relative mixture of stock options and RSUs for the initial and annual award grants and the methodology for determining the number of shares of the Company’s common stock subject to these grants without shareholder approval. Each share issued with respect to RSUs granted under the Director Plan reduces the number of shares available for grant under the plan by two shares. The Director Plan expires November 9, 2019. All RSUs granted under the Director Plan are entitled to DERs. DERs are subject to the same vesting and other terms and conditions as the corresponding unvested RSUs. DERs are accumulated and paid when the underlying shares vest. As of September 30, 2017, approximately 1.1 million shares were reserved for future issuance under the Director Plan.Rule 10b5-1 Trading PlansDuring the three months ended September 30, 2017, Section 16 officers Angela Ahrendts, Timothy D. Cook, Luca Maestri, Daniel Riccio and Philip Schiller had equity trading plans in place in accordance with Rule 10b5-1(c)(1) under the Exchange Act. An equity trading plan is a written document that pre-establishes the amounts, prices and dates (or formula for determining the amounts, prices and dates) of future purchases or sales of the Company’s stock, including shares acquired pursuant to the Company’s employee and director equity plans.Employee Stock Purchase PlanThe Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the “Purchase Plan”) is a shareholder approved plan under which substantially all employees may purchase the Company’s common stock through payroll deductions at a price equal to 85% of the lower of the fair market values of the stock as of the beginning or the end of six-month offering periods. An employee’s payroll deductions under the Purchase Plan are limited to 10% of the employee’s compensation and employees may not purchase more than $25,000 of stock during any calendar year. As of September 30, 2017, approximately 41.5 million shares were reserved for future issuance under the Purchase Plan.401(k) PlanThe Company’s 401(k) Plan is a deferred salary arrangement under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code. Under the 401(k) Plan, participating U.S. employees may defer a portion of their pre-tax earnings, up to the IRS annual contribution limit ($18,000 for calendar year 2017). The Company matches 50% to 100% of each employee’s contributions, depending on length of service, up to a maximum 6% of the employee’s eligible earnings.Apple Inc. | 2017 Form 10-K | 63

Restricted Stock UnitsA summary of the Company’s RSU activity and related information for 2017, 2016 and 2015, is as follows:The fair value as of the respective vesting dates of RSUs was $6.1 billion, $5.1 billion and $4.8 billion for 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The majority of RSUs that vested in 2017, 2016 and 2015 were net share settled such that the Company withheld shares with value equivalent to the employees’ minimum statutory obligation for the applicable income and other employment taxes, and remitted the cash to the appropriate taxing authorities. The total shares withheld were approximately 15.4 million, 15.9 million and 14.1 million for 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and were based on the value of the RSUs on their respective vesting dates as determined by the Company’s closing stock price. Total payments for the employees’ tax obligations to taxing authorities were $2.0 billion, $1.7 billion and $1.6 billion in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and are reflected as a financing activity within the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. These net share settlements had the effect of share repurchases by the Company as they reduced the number of shares that would have otherwise been issued as a result of the vesting and did not represent an expense to the Company.Share-based CompensationThe following table shows a summary of the share-based compensation expense included in the Consolidated Statements of Operations for 2017, 2016 and 2015 (in millions):The income tax benefit related to share-based compensation expense was $1.6 billion, $1.4 billion and $1.2 billion for 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. As of September 30, 2017, the total unrecognized compensation cost related to outstanding RSUs, restricted stock and stock options was $8.1 billion, which the Company expects to recognize over a weighted-average period of 2.5 years.Note 10 – Commitments and ContingenciesAccrued Warranty and IndemnificationThe following table shows changes in the Company’s accrued warranties and related costs for 2017, 2016 and 2015 (in millions):Apple Inc. | 2017 Form 10-K | 64



Agreements entered into by the Company sometimes include indemnification provisions which may subject the Company to costs and damages in the event of a claim against an indemnified third party. In the opinion of management, there was not at least a reasonable possibility the Company may have incurred a material loss, or a material loss in excess of a recorded accrual, with respect to indemnification of third parties.The Company offers an iPhone Upgrade Program, which is available to customers who purchase a qualifying iPhone in the U.S., the U.K. and mainland China. The iPhone Upgrade Program provides customers the right to trade in that iPhone for a specified amount when purchasing a new iPhone, provided certain conditions are met. The Company accounts for the trade-in right as a guarantee liability and recognizes arrangement revenue net of the fair value of such right, with subsequent changes to the guarantee liability recognized within revenue.The Company has entered into indemnification agreements with its directors and executive officers. Under these agreements, the Company has agreed to indemnify such individuals to the fullest extent permitted by law against liabilities that arise by reason of their status as directors or officers of the Company and to advance expenses incurred by such individuals in connection with related legal proceedings. It is not possible to determine the maximum potential amount of payments the Company could be required to make under these agreements due to the limited history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each claim. While the Company maintains directors and officers liability insurance coverage, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise.Concentrations in the Available Sources of Supply of Materials and ProductAlthough most components essential to the Company’s business are generally available from multiple sources, a few components are currently obtained from single or limited sources. In addition, the Company competes for various components with other participants in the markets for mobile communication and media devices and personal computers. Therefore, many components used by the Company, including those that are available from multiple sources, are at times subject to industry-wide shortage and significant pricing fluctuations that could materially adversely affect the Company’s financial condition and operating results.The Company uses some custom components that are not commonly used by its competitors, and new products introduced by the Company often utilize custom components available from only one source. When a component or product uses new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers’ yields have matured or manufacturing capacity has increased. If the Company’s supply of components for a new or existing product were delayed or constrained, or if an outsourcing partner delayed shipments of completed products to the Company, the Company’s financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected. The Company’s business and financial performance could also be materially adversely affected depending on the time required to obtain sufficient quantities from the original source, or to identify and obtain sufficient quantities from an alternative source. Continued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at all, may be affected if those suppliers decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the Company’s requirements.The Company has entered into agreements for the supply of many components; however, there can be no guarantee that the Company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms, or at all. Therefore, the Company remains subject to significant risks of supply shortages and price increases that could materially adversely affect its financial condition and operating results.Substantially all of the Company’s hardware products are manufactured by outsourcing partners that are located primarily in Asia, with some Mac computers manufactured in the U.S. and Ireland. A significant concentration of this manufacturing is currently performed by a small number of outsourcing partners, often in single locations. Certain of these outsourcing partners are the sole-sourced suppliers of components and manufacturers for many of the Company’s products. Although the Company works closely with its outsourcing partners on manufacturing schedules, the Company’s operating results could be adversely affected if its outsourcing partners were unable to meet their production commitments. The Company’s manufacturing purchase obligations typically cover its requirements for periods up to 150 days.Other Off-Balance Sheet CommitmentsOperating LeasesThe Company leases various equipment and facilities, including retail space, under noncancelable operating lease arrangements. The Company does not currently utilize any other off-balance sheet financing arrangements. As of September 30, 2017, the Company’s total future minimum lease payments under noncancelable operating leases were $9.5 billion. The Company’s retail store and other facility leases typically have original terms not exceeding 10 years and generally contain multi-year renewal options.Apple Inc. | 2017 Form 10-K | 65

Rent expense under all operating leases, including both cancelable and noncancelable leases, was $1.1 billion, $939 million and $794 million in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Future minimum lease payments under noncancelable operating leases having initial or remaining terms in excess of one year as of September 30, 2017, are as follows (in millions):Unconditional Purchase ObligationsThe Company has entered into certain off-balance sheet arrangements which require the future purchase of goods or services (“Unconditional Purchase Obligations”). The Company’s Unconditional Purchase Obligations primarily consist of payments for supplier arrangements, internet and telecommunication services and intellectual property licenses. Future payments under noncancelable Unconditional Purchase Obligations having a remaining term in excess of one year as of September 30, 2017, are as follows (in millions):ContingenciesThe Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that have arisen in the ordinary course of business and that have not been fully adjudicated, as further discussed in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K under the heading “Risk Factors” and in Part I, Item 3 of this Form 10-K under the heading “Legal Proceedings.” In the opinion of management, there was not at least a reasonable possibility the Company may have incurred a material loss, or a material loss in excess of a recorded accrual, with respect to loss contingencies for asserted legal and other claims. However, the outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain. Therefore, although management considers the likelihood of such an outcome to be remote, if one or more of these legal matters were resolved against the Company in a reporting period for amounts in excess of management’s expectations, the Company’s consolidated financial statements for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected.Apple Inc. v. Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd., et al.On August 24, 2012, a jury returned a verdict awarding the Company $1.05 billion in its lawsuit against Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. and affiliated parties in the United States District Court, Northern District of California, San Jose Division. On March 6, 2014, the District Court entered final judgment in favor of the Company in the amount of approximately $930 million. On May 18, 2015, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit affirmed in part, and reversed in part, the decision of the District Court. As a result, the Court of Appeals ordered entry of final judgment on damages in the amount of approximately $548 million, with the District Court to determine supplemental damages and interest, as well as damages owed for products subject to the reversal in part. Samsung paid $548 million to the Company in December 2015, which was included in net sales in the Consolidated Statement of Operations. On December 6, 2016, the U.S. Supreme Court remanded the case to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit for further proceedings related to the $548 million in damages. On February 7, 2017, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit remanded the case to the District Court to determine what additional proceedings, if any, are needed. On October 22, 2017, on remand from the U.S. Supreme Court, the District Court ordered a new trial on damages.Apple Inc. | 2017 Form 10-K | 66

Note 11 – Segment Information and Geographic DataThe Company reports segment information based on the “management” approach. The management approach designates the internal reporting used by management for making decisions and assessing performance as the source of the Company’s reportable segments.The Company manages its business primarily on a geographic basis. The Company’s reportable segments consist of the Americas, Europe, Greater China, Japan and Rest of Asia Pacific. Americas includes both North and South America. Europe includes European countries, as well as India, the Middle East and Africa. Greater China includes China, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Rest of Asia Pacific includes Australia and those Asian countries not included in the Company’s other reportable segments. Although the reportable segments provide similar hardware and software products and similar services, each one is managed separately to better align with the location of the Company’s customers and distribution partners and the unique market dynamics of each geographic region. The accounting policies of the various segments are the same as those described in Note 1, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.”The Company evaluates the performance of its reportable segments based on net sales and operating income. Net sales for geographic segments are generally based on the location of customers and sales through the Company’s retail stores located in those geographic locations. Operating income for each segment includes net sales to third parties, related cost of sales and operating expenses directly attributable to the segment. Advertising expenses are generally included in the geographic segment in which the expenditures are incurred. Operating income for each segment excludes other income and expense and certain expenses managed outside the reportable segments. Costs excluded from segment operating income include various corporate expenses such as R&D, corporate marketing expenses, certain share-based compensation expenses, income taxes, various nonrecurring charges and other separately managed general and administrative costs. The Company does not include intercompany transfers between segments for management reporting purposes.The following table shows information by reportable segment for 2017, 2016 and 2015 (in millions):A reconciliation of the Company’s segment operating income to the Consolidated Statements of Operations for 2017, 2016 and 2015 is as follows (in millions):Apple Inc. | 2017 Form 10-K | 67

Report of Ernst & Young LLP, Independent Registered Public Accounting FirmThe Board of Directors and Shareholders of Apple Inc.We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Apple Inc. as of September 30, 2017 and September 24, 2016, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, shareholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 30, 2017. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.

Report of Ernst & Young LLP, Independent Registered Public Accounting FirmThe Board of Directors and Shareholders of Apple Inc.We have audited Apple Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2017, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (“the COSO criteria”). Apple Inc.’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.In our opinion, Apple Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2017, based on the COSO criteria.We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the 2017 consolidated financial statements of Apple Inc. and our report dated November 3, 2017 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.San Jose, CaliforniaNovember 3, 2017Apple Inc. | 2017 Form 10-K | 71

## Item 1A


In addition to an adverse impact on demand for the Company’s products, uncertainty about, or a decline in, global or regional economic conditions could have a significant impact on the Company’s suppliers, contract manufacturers, logistics providers, distributors, cellular network carriers and other channel partners. Potential effects include financial instability; inability to obtain credit to finance operations and purchases of the Company’s products; and insolvency.A downturn in the economic environment could also lead to increased credit and collectibility risk on the Company’s trade receivables; the failure of derivative counterparties and other financial institutions; limitations on the Company’s ability to issue new debt; reduced liquidity; and declines in the fair value of the Company’s financial instruments. These and other economic factors could materially adversely affect the Company’s business, results of operations, financial condition and growth.Global markets for the Company’s products and services are highly competitive and subject to rapid technological change, and the Company may be unable to compete effectively in these markets.The Company’s products and services are offered in highly competitive global markets characterized by aggressive price competition and resulting downward pressure on gross margins, frequent introduction of new products and services, short product life cycles, evolving industry standards, continual improvement in product price and performance characteristics, rapid adoption of technological advancements by competitors, and price sensitivity on the part of consumers and businesses.The Company’s ability to compete successfully depends heavily on ensuring the continuing and timely introduction of innovative new products, services and technologies to the marketplace. The Company believes it is unique in that it designs and develops nearly the entire solution for its products, including the hardware, operating system, numerous software applications and related services. As a result, the Company must make significant investments in R&D. There can be no assurance that these investments will achieve expected returns, and the Company may not be able to develop and market new products and services successfully.The Company currently holds a significant number of patents, trademarks and copyrights and has registered, and applied to register, numerous patents, trademarks and copyrights. In contrast, many of the Company’s competitors seek to compete primarily through aggressive pricing and very low cost structures, and by emulating the Company’s products and infringing on its intellectual property. Effective intellectual property protection may not be consistently available in every country in which the Company operates. If the Company is unable to continue to develop and sell innovative new products with attractive margins or if competitors infringe on the Company’s intellectual property, the Company’s ability to maintain a competitive advantage could be adversely affected.The Company has a minority market share in the global smartphone, personal computer and tablet markets. The Company faces substantial competition in these markets from companies that have significant technical, marketing, distribution and other resources, as well as established hardware, software and digital content supplier relationships. In addition, some of the Company’s competitors have broader product lines, lower-priced products and a larger installed base of active devices. Competition has been particularly intense as competitors have aggressively cut prices and lowered product margins. Certain competitors may have the resources, experience or cost structures to provide products at little or no profit or even at a loss. Some of the markets in which the Company competes have from time to time experienced little to no growth or contracted overall.Additionally, the Company faces significant competition as competitors imitate the Company’s product features and applications within their products or collaborate to offer solutions that are more competitive than those they currently offer. The Company also expects competition to intensify as competitors imitate the Company’s approach to providing components seamlessly within their offerings or work collaboratively to offer integrated solutions.The Company’s services also face substantial competition, including from companies that have significant resources and experience and have established service offerings with large customer bases. The Company competes with business models that provide content to users for free. The Company also competes with illegitimate means to obtain third-party digital content and applications.The Company’s financial condition and operating results depend substantially on the Company’s ability to continually improve its products and services to maintain their functional and design advantages. There can be no assurance the Company will be able to continue to provide products and services that compete effectively.Apple Inc. | 2020 Form 10-K | 6



To remain competitive and stimulate customer demand, the Company must successfully manage frequent introductions and transitions of products and services.Due to the highly volatile and competitive nature of the industries in which the Company competes, the Company must continually introduce new products, services and technologies, enhance existing products and services, effectively stimulate customer demand for new and upgraded products and services, and successfully manage the transition to these new and upgraded products and services. The success of new product and service introductions depends on a number of factors including, but not limited to, timely and successful development, market acceptance, the Company’s ability to manage the risks associated with new product production ramp-up issues, the availability of application software for new products, the effective management of purchase commitments and inventory levels in line with anticipated product demand, the availability of products in appropriate quantities and at expected costs to meet anticipated demand, and the risk that new products and services may have quality or other defects or deficiencies. Accordingly, the Company cannot determine in advance the ultimate effect of new product and service introductions and transitions.The Company depends on the performance of carriers, wholesalers, retailers and other resellers.The Company distributes its products through cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers and resellers, many of whom distribute products from competing manufacturers. The Company also sells its products and resells third-party products in most of its major markets directly to consumers, small and mid-sized businesses, and education, enterprise and government customers through its retail and online stores and its direct sales force.Some carriers providing cellular network service for iPhone offer financing, installment payment plans or subsidies for users’ purchases of the device. There is no assurance that such offers will be continued at all or in the same amounts upon renewal of the Company’s agreements with these carriers or in agreements the Company enters into with new carriers.The Company has invested and will continue to invest in programs to enhance reseller sales, including staffing selected resellers’ stores with Company employees and contractors, and improving product placement displays. These programs can require a substantial investment while not assuring return or incremental sales. The financial condition of these resellers could weaken, these resellers could stop distributing the Company’s products, or uncertainty regarding demand for some or all of the Company’s products could cause resellers to reduce their ordering and marketing of the Company’s products.The Company is exposed to the risk of write-downs on the value of its inventory and other assets, in addition to purchase commitment cancellation risk.The Company records a write-down for product and component inventories that have become obsolete or exceed anticipated demand, or for which cost exceeds net realizable value. The Company also accrues necessary cancellation fee reserves for orders of excess products and components. The Company reviews long-lived assets, including capital assets held at its suppliers’ facilities and inventory prepayments, for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate the assets may not be recoverable. If the Company determines that an impairment has occurred, it records a write-down equal to the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value. Although the Company believes its inventory, capital assets, inventory prepayments and other assets and purchase commitments are currently recoverable, no assurance can be given that the Company will not incur write-downs, fees, impairments and other charges given the rapid and unpredictable pace of product obsolescence in the industries in which the Company competes.The Company orders components for its products and builds inventory in advance of product announcements and shipments. Manufacturing purchase obligations cover the Company’s forecasted component and manufacturing requirements, typically for periods up to 150 days. Because the Company’s markets are volatile, competitive and subject to rapid technology and price changes, there is a risk the Company will forecast incorrectly and order or produce excess or insufficient amounts of components or products, or not fully utilize firm purchase commitments.Apple Inc. | 2020 Form 10-K | 7



Future operating results depend upon the Company’s ability to obtain components in sufficient quantities on commercially reasonable terms.Because the Company currently obtains certain components from single or limited sources, the Company is subject to significant supply and pricing risks. Many components, including those that are available from multiple sources, are at times subject to industry-wide shortages and significant commodity pricing fluctuations that could materially adversely affect the Company’s financial condition and operating results. While the Company has entered into agreements for the supply of many components, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms, or at all. Component suppliers may suffer from poor financial conditions, which can lead to business failure for the supplier or consolidation within a particular industry, further limiting the Company’s ability to obtain sufficient quantities of components on commercially reasonable terms. The effects of global or regional economic conditions on the Company’s suppliers, described in “Global and regional economic conditions could materially adversely affect the Company’s business, results of operations, financial condition and growth,” above, also could affect the Company’s ability to obtain components. Therefore, the Company remains subject to significant risks of supply shortages and price increases that could materially adversely affect its financial condition and operating results.The Company’s new products often utilize custom components available from only one source. When a component or product uses new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers’ yields have matured or their manufacturing capacities have increased. The continued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at all, can be affected for any number of reasons, including if suppliers decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the Company’s requirements. If the Company’s supply of components for a new or existing product were delayed or constrained, or if an outsourcing partner delayed shipments of completed products to the Company, the Company’s financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected. The Company’s business and financial performance could also be materially adversely affected depending on the time required to obtain sufficient quantities from the source, or to identify and obtain sufficient quantities from an alternative source.The Company depends on component and product manufacturing and logistical services provided by outsourcing partners, many of which are located outside of the U.S.Substantially all of the Company’s manufacturing is performed in whole or in part by outsourcing partners located primarily in Asia. A significant concentration of this manufacturing is currently performed by a small number of outsourcing partners, often in single locations. The Company has also outsourced much of its transportation and logistics management. While these arrangements can lower operating costs, they also reduce the Company’s direct control over production and distribution. Such diminished control may have an adverse effect on the quality or quantity of products or services, or the Company’s flexibility to respond to changing conditions. Although arrangements with these partners may contain provisions for product defect expense reimbursement, the Company generally remains responsible to the consumer for warranty and out-of-warranty service in the event of product defects and could experience an unanticipated product defect liability. While the Company relies on its partners to adhere to its supplier code of conduct, material violations of the supplier code of conduct could occur.The Company relies on single-source outsourcing partners in the U.S., Asia and Europe to supply and manufacture many components, and on outsourcing partners primarily located in Asia, for final assembly of substantially all of the Company’s hardware products. Any failure of these partners to perform can have a negative impact on the Company’s cost or supply of components or finished goods. In addition, manufacturing or logistics in these locations or transit to final destinations can be disrupted for a variety of reasons including, but not limited to, natural and man-made disasters, information technology system failures, commercial disputes, military actions, economic, business, labor, environmental, public health or political issues, or international trade disputes.The Company has invested in manufacturing process equipment, much of which is held at certain of its outsourcing partners, and has made prepayments to certain of its suppliers associated with long-term supply agreements. While these arrangements help ensure the supply of components and finished goods, if these outsourcing partners or suppliers experience severe financial problems or other disruptions in their business, such continued supply can be reduced or terminated, and the recoverability of manufacturing process equipment or prepayments can be negatively impacted.Apple Inc. | 2020 Form 10-K | 8



The Company’s products and services may be affected from time to time by design and manufacturing defects that could materially adversely affect the Company’s business and result in harm to the Company’s reputation.The Company offers complex hardware and software products and services that can be affected by design and manufacturing defects. Sophisticated operating system software and applications, such as those offered by the Company, often have issues that can unexpectedly interfere with the intended operation of hardware or software products. Defects can also exist in components and products the Company purchases from third parties. Component defects could make the Company’s products unsafe and create a risk of environmental or property damage and personal injury. These risks may increase as the Company’s products are introduced into specialized applications, including healthcare. In addition, the Company’s service offerings may have quality issues and from time to time experience outages, service slowdowns or errors. As a result, the Company’s services may not perform as anticipated and may not meet customer expectations. There can be no assurance the Company will be able to detect and fix all issues and defects in the hardware, software and services it offers. Failure to do so could result in widespread technical and performance issues affecting the Company’s products and services. In addition, the Company can be exposed to product liability claims, recalls, product replacements or modifications, write-offs of inventory, property, plant and equipment, and/or intangible assets, and significant warranty and other expenses, including litigation costs and regulatory fines. Quality problems can also adversely affect the experience for users of the Company’s products and services, and result in harm to the Company’s reputation, loss of competitive advantage, poor market acceptance, reduced demand for products and services, delay in new product and service introductions and lost sales.The Company relies on access to third-party digital content, which may not be available to the Company on commercially reasonable terms or at all.The Company contracts with numerous third parties to offer their digital content to customers. This includes the right to sell currently available content. The licensing or other distribution arrangements with these third parties are for relatively short terms and do not guarantee the continuation or renewal of these arrangements on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. Some third-party content providers and distributors currently or in the future may offer competing products and services, and can take actions to make it more difficult or impossible for the Company to license or otherwise distribute their content in the future. Other content owners, providers or distributors may seek to limit the Company’s access to, or increase the cost of, such content. The Company may be unable to continue to offer a wide variety of content at commercially reasonable prices with acceptable usage rules, or continue to expand its geographic reach. Failure to obtain the right to make third-party digital content available, or to make such content available on commercially reasonable terms, could have a material adverse impact on the Company’s financial condition and operating results.Some third-party digital content providers require the Company to provide digital rights management and other security solutions. If requirements change, the Company may have to develop or license new technology to provide these solutions. There is no assurance the Company will be able to develop or license such solutions at a reasonable cost and in a timely manner. In addition, certain countries have passed or may propose and adopt legislation that would force the Company to license its digital rights management, which could lessen the protection of content and subject it to piracy and also could negatively affect arrangements with the Company’s content providers.The Company’s future performance depends in part on support from third-party software developers.The Company believes decisions by customers to purchase its hardware products depend in part on the availability of third-party software applications and services. There is no assurance that third-party developers will continue to develop and maintain software applications and services for the Company’s products. If third-party software applications and services cease to be developed and maintained for the Company’s products, customers may choose not to buy the Company’s products.The Company believes the availability of third-party software applications and services for its products depends in part on the developers’ perception and analysis of the relative benefits of developing, maintaining and upgrading such software and services for the Company’s products compared to competitors’ platforms, such as Android for smartphones and tablets and Windows for personal computers. This analysis may be based on factors such as the market position of the Company and its products, the anticipated revenue that may be generated, expected future growth of product sales, and the costs of developing such applications and services.The Company’s minority market share in the global smartphone, personal computer and tablet markets could make developers less inclined to develop or upgrade software for the Company’s products and more inclined to devote their resources to developing and upgrading software for competitors’ products with larger market share. If developers focus their efforts on these competing platforms, the availability and quality of applications for the Company’s devices may suffer.Apple Inc. | 2020 Form 10-K | 9



The Company relies on the continued availability and development of compelling and innovative software applications for its products. The Company’s products and operating systems are subject to rapid technological change, and if third-party developers are unable to or choose not to keep up with this pace of change, third-party applications might not take advantage of these changes to deliver improved customer experiences or might not operate correctly and may result in dissatisfied customers.The Company sells and delivers third-party applications for its products through the App Store. For the vast majority of applications, developers keep all of the revenue they generate on the App Store. The Company only retains a commission from sales of applications through its platforms and in situations where a developer offers purchases for digital features, services, or goods within an application. If developers reduce their use of the Company’s platforms, including in-app purchases, then the volume of sales, and the commission that the Company earns on those sales, would decrease. If the rate of the commission that the Company retains on such sales is reduced, or if it is otherwise narrowed in scope or eliminated, the Company’s financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected.The Company relies on access to third-party intellectual property, which may not be available to the Company on commercially reasonable terms or at all.Many of the Company’s products and services are designed to include intellectual property owned by third parties, which requires licenses from those third parties. In addition, because of technological changes in the industries in which the Company currently competes or in the future may compete, current extensive patent coverage and the rapid rate of issuance of new patents, the Company’s products and services may unknowingly infringe existing patents or intellectual property rights of others. From time to time, the Company has been notified that it may be infringing certain patents or other intellectual property rights of third parties. Based on experience and industry practice, the Company believes licenses to such third-party intellectual property can generally be obtained on commercially reasonable terms. There is, however, no assurance that the necessary licenses can be obtained on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Failure to obtain the right to use third-party intellectual property, or to use such intellectual property on commercially reasonable terms, could preclude the Company from selling certain products or services, or otherwise have a material adverse impact on the Company’s financial condition and operating results.The Company’s financial condition and operating results could be adversely impacted by unfavorable results of legal proceedings or government investigations.The Company is subject to various claims, legal proceedings and government investigations that have arisen in the ordinary course of business and have not yet been fully resolved, and new matters may arise in the future. In addition, agreements entered into by the Company sometimes include indemnification provisions which can subject the Company to costs and damages in the event of a claim against an indemnified third party. The number of claims, legal proceedings and government investigations involving the Company, and the alleged magnitude of such claims, proceedings and government investigations, has generally increased over time and may continue to increase.The Company has faced and continues to face a significant number of patent claims relating to its cellular-enabled products, and new claims may arise in the future. For example, technology and other patent-holding companies frequently assert their patents and seek royalties and often enter into litigation based on allegations of patent infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. The Company is vigorously defending infringement actions in courts in several U.S. jurisdictions, as well as internationally in various countries. The plaintiffs in these actions frequently seek injunctions and substantial damages.Regardless of the merit of particular claims, defending against litigation or responding to government investigations can be expensive, time-consuming, disruptive to the Company’s operations and distracting to management. In recognition of these considerations, the Company may enter into agreements or other arrangements to settle litigation and resolve such challenges. No assurance can be given that such agreements can be obtained on acceptable terms or that litigation will not occur. These agreements may also significantly increase the Company’s cost of sales and operating expenses.Except as described in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Note 10, “Commitments and Contingencies” under the heading “Contingencies,” in the opinion of management, there was not at least a reasonable possibility the Company may have incurred a material loss, or a material loss greater than a recorded accrual, concerning loss contingencies for asserted legal and other claims, including matters related to infringement of intellectual property rights.The outcome of litigation or government investigations is inherently uncertain. If one or more legal matters were resolved against the Company or an indemnified third party in a reporting period for amounts above management’s expectations, the Company’s financial condition and operating results for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected. Further, such an outcome could result in significant compensatory, punitive or trebled monetary damages, disgorgement of revenue or profits, remedial corporate measures or injunctive relief against the Company, and could require the Company to change its business practices or limit the Company’s ability to offer certain products and services, all of which could materially adversely affect its financial condition and operating results.While the Company maintains insurance coverage for certain types of claims, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise.Apple Inc. | 2020 Form 10-K | 10



The Company is subject to complex and changing laws and regulations worldwide, which exposes the Company to potential liabilities, increased costs and other adverse effects on the Company’s business.The Company’s global operations are subject to complex and changing laws and regulations on subjects including, but not limited to: antitrust; privacy, data security and data localization; consumer protection; advertising, sales, billing and e-commerce; product liability; intellectual property ownership and infringement; digital platforms; Internet, telecommunications, and mobile communications; media, television, film and digital content; availability of third-party software applications and services; labor and employment; anti-corruption; import, export and trade; foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions; anti–money laundering; foreign ownership and investment; tax; and environmental, health and safety.Compliance with these laws and regulations may be onerous and expensive, increasing the cost of conducting the Company’s global operations. Changes to laws and regulations can adversely affect the Company’s business by increasing the Company’s costs, limiting the Company’s ability to offer a product or service to customers, requiring changes to the Company’s supply chain and business practices or otherwise making the Company’s products and services less attractive to customers. The Company has implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations, but there can be no assurance that the Company’s employees, contractors or agents will not violate such laws and regulations or the Company’s policies and procedures. If the Company is found to have violated laws and regulations, it could materially adversely affect the Company’s reputation, financial condition and operating results.The technology industry, including, in some instances, the Company, is subject to intense media, political and regulatory scrutiny, which exposes the Company to government investigations, legal actions and penalties. For example, the Company is subject to antitrust investigations in various jurisdictions around the world, which can result in legal proceedings and claims against the Company that could, individually or in the aggregate, have a materially adverse impact on the Company’s financial condition and operating results. In addition, if enacted, legislative and other proposals to further regulate technology companies could result in changes to the Company’s business, including requiring the Company to modify its product and service offerings, limiting the Company’s ability to invest in strategic acquisitions, or affecting the Company’s business relationships with other technology companies, and could have a materially adverse impact on the Company’s financial condition and operating results. Further, the Company’s business partners are or may become subject to litigation that, if resolved against them, could affect the Company’s relationships with these business partners and have a materially adverse impact on the Company’s financial condition and operating results. There can be no assurance that the Company’s business will not be materially adversely affected, individually or in the aggregate, by the outcomes of such investigations, litigation or changes to laws and regulations in the future.The Company’s retail stores have required and will continue to require a substantial investment and commitment of resources and are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties.The Company’s retail stores have required substantial investment in equipment and leasehold improvements, information systems, inventory and personnel. The Company also has entered into substantial lease commitments for retail space. Certain stores have been designed and built to serve as high-profile venues to promote brand awareness. Because of their unique design elements, locations and size, these stores require substantially more investment than the Company’s more typical retail stores. Due to the high cost structure associated with the Company’s retail stores, a decline in sales or the closure or poor performance of an individual store or multiple stores, including as a result of protective public safety measures in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, could result in significant lease termination costs, write-offs of equipment and leasehold improvements and severance costs.The Company’s retail operations are subject to many factors that pose risks and uncertainties and could adversely impact the Company’s financial condition and operating results, including macro-economic factors that could have an adverse effect on general retail activity. Other factors include, but are not limited to, the Company’s ability to: manage costs associated with retail store construction and operation; manage relationships with existing retail partners; manage costs associated with fluctuations in the value of retail inventory; and obtain and renew leases in quality retail locations at a reasonable cost.Investment in new business strategies and acquisitions could disrupt the Company’s ongoing business, present risks not originally contemplated and adversely affect the Company’s reputation, financial condition and operating results.The Company has invested, and in the future may invest, in new business strategies or acquisitions. Such endeavors may involve significant risks and uncertainties, including distraction of management from current operations, greater-than-expected liabilities and expenses, economic, political, legal and regulatory challenges associated with operating in new businesses, regions or countries, inadequate return on capital, potential impairment of tangible and intangible assets, and significant write-offs. These new ventures are inherently risky and may not be successful. The failure of any significant investment could adversely affect the Company’s reputation, financial condition and operating results.Apple Inc. | 2020 Form 10-K | 11



The Company’s business and reputation may be impacted by information technology system failures or network disruptions.The Company is exposed to information technology system failures or network disruptions caused by natural disasters, accidents, power disruptions, telecommunications failures, acts of terrorism or war, computer viruses, physical or electronic break-ins, or other events or disruptions. System redundancy and other continuity measures may be ineffective or inadequate, and the Company’s business continuity and disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities. Such failures or disruptions can adversely impact the Company’s business by, among other things, preventing access to the Company’s online services, interfering with customer transactions or impeding the manufacturing and shipping of the Company’s products. These events could materially adversely affect the Company’s reputation, financial condition and operating results.There may be losses or unauthorized access to or releases of confidential information, including personally identifiable information, that could subject the Company to significant reputational, financial, legal and operational consequences.The Company’s business requires it to use and store confidential information including, among other things, personally identifiable information (“PII”) with respect to the Company’s customers and employees. The Company devotes significant resources to network and data security, including through the use of encryption and other security measures intended to protect its systems and data. But these measures cannot provide absolute security, and losses or unauthorized access to or releases of confidential information occur and could materially adversely affect the Company’s reputation, financial condition and operating results.The Company’s business also requires it to share confidential information with suppliers and other third parties. Although the Company takes steps to secure confidential information that is provided to third parties, such measures are not always effective and losses or unauthorized access to or releases of confidential information occur and could materially adversely affect the Company’s reputation, financial condition and operating results.For example, the Company may experience a security breach impacting the Company’s information technology systems that compromises the confidentiality, integrity or availability of confidential information. Such an incident could, among other things, impair the Company’s ability to attract and retain customers for its products and services, impact the Company’s stock price, materially damage supplier relationships, and expose the Company to litigation or government investigations, which could result in penalties, fines or judgments against the Company.Although malicious attacks perpetrated to gain access to confidential information, including PII, affect many companies across various industries, the Company is at a relatively greater risk of being targeted because of its high profile and the value of the confidential information it creates, owns, manages, stores and processes.The Company has implemented systems and processes intended to secure its information technology systems and prevent unauthorized access to or loss of sensitive data, including through the use of encryption and authentication technologies. As with all companies, these security measures may not be sufficient for all eventualities and may be vulnerable to hacking, employee error, malfeasance, system error, faulty password management or other irregularities. For example, third parties fraudulently induce employees or customers into disclosing user names, passwords or other sensitive information, which may, in turn, be used to access the Company’s information technology systems. To help protect customers and the Company, the Company monitors its services and systems for unusual activity and may freeze accounts under suspicious circumstances, which, among other things, may result in the delay or loss of customer orders or impede customer access to the Company’s products and services.In addition to the risks relating to general confidential information described above, the Company is also subject to specific obligations relating to health data and payment card data. Health data is subject to additional privacy, security and breach notification requirements, and the Company can be subject to audit by governmental authorities regarding the Company’s compliance with these obligations. If the Company fails to adequately comply with these rules and requirements, or if health data is handled in a manner not permitted by law or under the Company’s agreements with healthcare institutions, the Company could be subject to litigation or government investigations, may be liable for associated investigatory expenses, and could also incur significant fees or fines.Under payment card rules and obligations, if cardholder information is potentially compromised, the Company could be liable for associated investigatory expenses and could also incur significant fees or fines if the Company fails to follow payment card industry data security standards. The Company could also experience a significant increase in payment card transaction costs or lose the ability to process payment cards if it fails to follow payment card industry data security standards, which would materially adversely affect the Company’s reputation, financial condition and operating results.While the Company maintains insurance coverage that is intended to address certain aspects of data security risks, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise.Apple Inc. | 2020 Form 10-K | 12



The Company’s business is subject to a variety of U.S. and international laws, rules, policies and other obligations regarding data protection.The Company is subject to federal, state and international laws relating to the collection, use, retention, security and transfer of PII. In many cases, these laws apply not only to third-party transactions, but also may restrict transfers of PII among the Company and its international subsidiaries. Several jurisdictions have passed laws in this area, and other jurisdictions are considering imposing additional restrictions. These laws continue to develop and may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Complying with emerging and changing international requirements may cause the Company to incur substantial costs or require the Company to change its business practices. Noncompliance could result in significant penalties or legal liability.The Company makes statements about its use and disclosure of PII through its privacy policy, information provided on its website and press statements. Any failure by the Company to comply with these public statements or with other federal, state or international privacy-related or data protection laws and regulations could result in proceedings against the Company by governmental entities or others. In addition to reputational impacts, penalties could include ongoing audit requirements and significant legal liability.The Company’s success depends largely on the continued service and availability of key personnel.Much of the Company’s future success depends on the continued availability and service of key personnel, including its Chief Executive Officer, executive team and other highly skilled employees. Experienced personnel in the technology industry are in high demand and competition for their talents is intense, especially in Silicon Valley, where most of the Company’s key personnel are located.The Company’s business can be impacted by political events, international trade disputes, war, terrorism, natural disasters, public health issues, industrial accidents and other business interruptions.Political events, international trade disputes, war, terrorism, natural disasters, public health issues, industrial accidents and other business interruptions could harm or disrupt international commerce and the global economy, and could have a material adverse effect on the Company and its customers, suppliers, contract manufacturers, logistics providers, distributors, cellular network carriers and other channel partners.The Company has a large, global business, and the Company believes that it generally benefits from growth in international trade. International trade disputes can result in tariffs, sanctions, and other measures that restrict international trade and can adversely affect the Company’s business. For example, tensions between the U.S. and China have led to a series of tariffs being imposed by the U.S. on imports from China mainland, as well as other business restrictions. Tariffs may increase the cost of the Company’s products and the components and raw materials that go into making them. These increased costs adversely impact the gross margin that the Company earns on its products. Tariffs can also make the Company’s products more expensive for customers, which could make the Company’s products less competitive and reduce consumer demand. Countries may also adopt other measures, such as controls on imports or exports of goods, technology or data, that could adversely impact the Company’s operations and supply chain and limit the Company’s ability to offer its products and services as designed. These measures can require the Company to take various actions, including change suppliers, restructure business relationships, and stop offering third-party applications on its platforms. Changing the Company’s operations in accordance with new or changed trade restrictions may be expensive, time-consuming, disruptive to the Company’s operations and distracting to management. Trade restrictions may be announced with little or no advance notice and the Company may not be able to effectively mitigate all adverse impacts from such measures. Political uncertainty surrounding international trade disputes could also have a negative effect on consumer confidence and spending, which could adversely affect the Company’s business.Many of the Company’s operations and facilities, as well as critical business operations of the Company’s suppliers and contract manufacturers, are in locations that are prone to earthquakes and other natural disasters. In addition, such operations and facilities are subject to the risk of interruption by fire, power shortages, nuclear power plant accidents and other industrial accidents, terrorist attacks and other hostile acts, labor disputes, public health issues, including pandemics such as the COVID-19 pandemic, and other events beyond the Company’s control. Global climate change could result in certain types of natural disasters occurring more frequently or with more intense effects. Such events could make it difficult or impossible for the Company to manufacture and deliver products to its customers, create delays and inefficiencies in the Company’s supply and manufacturing chain, and result in slowdowns and outages to the Company’s service offerings. Following an interruption to its business, the Company could require substantial recovery time, experience significant expenditures to resume operations, and lose significant sales. Because the Company relies on single or limited sources for the supply and manufacture of many critical components, a business interruption affecting such sources would exacerbate any negative consequences to the Company.Apple Inc. | 2020 Form 10-K | 13



The Company’s operations are also subject to the risks of industrial accidents at its suppliers and contract manufacturers. While the Company’s suppliers are required to maintain safe working environments and operations, an industrial accident could occur and could result in disruption to the Company’s business and harm to the Company’s reputation. Major public health issues, including pandemics such as the COVID-19 pandemic, have adversely affected, and could in the future adversely affect, the Company due to their impact on the global economy and demand for consumer products; the imposition of protective public safety measures, such as stringent employee travel restrictions and limitations on freight services and the movement of products between regions; and disruptions in the Company’s supply chain and sales and distribution channels, resulting in interruptions of the supply of current products and delays in production ramps of new products.While the Company maintains insurance coverage for certain types of losses, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses that may arise.The Company expects its quarterly net sales and operating results to fluctuate.The Company’s profit margins vary across its products, services, geographic segments and distribution channels. For example, the gross margins on the Company’s products and services vary significantly and can change over time. The Company’s gross margins are subject to volatility and downward pressure due to a variety of factors, including: continued industry-wide global product pricing pressures and product pricing actions that the Company may take in response to such pressures; increased competition; the Company’s ability to effectively stimulate demand for certain of its products and services; compressed product life cycles; potential increases in the cost of components, outside manufacturing services, and developing, acquiring and delivering content for the Company’s services; the Company’s ability to manage product quality and warranty costs effectively; shifts in the mix of products and services, or in the geographic, currency or channel mix; fluctuations in foreign exchange rates; and the introduction of new products or services, including new products or services with higher cost structures. These and other factors could have a materially adverse impact on the Company’s financial condition and operating results.The Company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its fiscal year due in part to seasonal holiday demand. Additionally, new product and service introductions can significantly impact net sales, cost of sales and operating expenses. Further, the Company generates a significant portion of its net sales from a single product and a decline in demand for that product could significantly impact quarterly net sales. The Company could also be subject to unexpected developments, such as lower-than-anticipated demand for the Company’s products or services, issues with new product or service introductions, information technology system failures or network disruptions, or failure of one of the Company’s logistics, components supply, or manufacturing partners.The Company’s stock price is subject to volatility.The Company’s stock price has experienced substantial price volatility in the past and may continue to do so in the future. Additionally, the Company, the technology industry and the stock market as a whole have experienced extreme stock price and volume fluctuations that have affected stock prices in ways that may have been unrelated to these companies’ operating performance. Price volatility over a given period may cause the average price at which the Company repurchases its stock to exceed the stock’s price at a given point in time. The Company believes its stock price should reflect expectations of future growth and profitability. The Company also believes its stock price should reflect expectations that its cash dividend will continue at current levels or grow, and that its current share repurchase program will be fully consummated. Future dividends are subject to declaration by the Company’s Board of Directors, and the Company’s share repurchase program does not obligate it to acquire any specific number of shares. If the Company fails to meet expectations related to future growth, profitability, dividends, share repurchases or other market expectations, its stock price may decline significantly, which could have a material adverse impact on investor confidence and employee retention.The Company’s financial performance is subject to risks associated with changes in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to local currencies.The Company’s primary exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates relates to non–U.S. dollar–denominated sales, cost of sales and operating expenses worldwide. Gross margins on the Company’s products in foreign countries and on products that include components obtained from foreign suppliers could be materially adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.The weakening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar adversely affects the U.S. dollar value of the Company’s foreign currency–denominated sales and earnings, and generally leads the Company to raise international pricing, potentially reducing demand for the Company’s products. In some circumstances, for competitive or other reasons, the Company may decide not to raise international pricing to offset the U.S. dollar’s strengthening, which would adversely affect the U.S. dollar value of the gross margins the Company earns on foreign currency–denominated sales.Apple Inc. | 2020 Form 10-K | 14

The Company’s reportable segments consist of the Americas, Europe, Greater China, Japan and Rest of Asia Pacific. Americas includes both North and South America. Europe includes European countries, as well as India, the Middle East and Africa. Greater China includes China mainland, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Rest of Asia Pacific includes Australia and those Asian countries not included in the Company’s other reportable segments. Although the reportable segments provide similar hardware and software products and similar services, each one is managed separately to better align with the location of the Company’s customers and distribution partners and the unique market dynamics of each geographic region. Further information regarding the Company’s reportable segments can be found in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Note 11, “Segment Information and Geographic Data.”The following table shows net sales by reportable segment for 2020, 2019 and 2018 (dollars in millions):AmericasAmericas net sales increased during 2020 compared to 2019 due primarily to higher net sales of Services and Wearables, Home and Accessories.

Gross MarginProducts and Services gross margin and gross margin percentage for 2020, 2019 and 2018 were as follows (dollars in millions):Products Gross MarginProducts gross margin increased during 2020 compared to 2019 due primarily to higher Products volume and material cost savings, partially offset by the weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar and a different Products mix. Products gross margin percentage decreased during 2020 compared to 2019 due primarily to the weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar and a different Products mix, partially offset by material cost savings and higher leverage.Services Gross MarginServices gross margin increased during 2020 compared to 2019 due primarily to higher Services net sales and a different Services mix. Services gross margin percentage increased during 2020 compared to 2019 due primarily to a different Services mix and higher leverage, partially offset by higher Services costs.The Company’s future gross margins can be impacted by a variety of factors, as set forth in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K under the heading “Risk Factors.” As a result, the Company believes, in general, gross margins will be subject to volatility and remain under downward pressure.Operating ExpensesOperating expenses for 2020, 2019 and 2018 were as follows (dollars in millions):Research and DevelopmentThe year-over-year growth in R&D expense in 2020 was driven primarily by increases in headcount-related expenses. The Company continues to believe that focused investments in R&D are critical to its future growth and competitive position in the marketplace, and to the development of new and updated products and services that are central to the Company’s core business strategy.Selling, General and AdministrativeThe year-over-year growth in selling, general and administrative expense in 2020 was driven primarily by increases in headcount-related expenses, higher spending on marketing and advertising, and higher variable selling expenses.Apple Inc. | 2020 Form 10-K | 23

Other Income/(Expense), NetOther income/(expense), net (“OI&E”) for 2020, 2019 and 2018 was as follows (dollars in millions):The year-over-year decrease in OI&E during 2020 was due primarily to lower interest income and net impairment/gain activity on non-marketable securities, partially offset by lower interest expense. The weighted-average interest rate earned by the Company on its cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities was 1.85% and 2.19% in 2020 and 2019, respectively.Provision for Income TaxesProvision for income taxes, effective tax rate and statutory federal income tax rate for 2020, 2019 and 2018 were as follows (dollars in millions):The Company’s effective tax rate for both 2020 and 2019 was lower than the statutory federal income tax rate due primarily to the lower tax rate on foreign earnings, including the impact of tax settlements, and tax benefits from share-based compensation.The Company’s effective tax rate for 2020 was lower compared to 2019 due primarily to a one-time adjustment of U.S. foreign tax credits in response to regulations issued by the U.S. Department of the Treasury in December 2019 in connection with the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the “Act”) and higher tax benefits from share-based compensation.As of September 26, 2020, the Company had net deferred tax assets arising from deductible temporary differences and tax credits of $11.0 billion and deferred tax liabilities of $2.8 billion. Management believes it is more likely than not that forecasted income, including income that may be generated as a result of certain tax planning strategies, together with future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, will be sufficient to recover the net deferred tax assets. The Company will continue to evaluate the amount of the valuation allowance, if any, by assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets.Recent Accounting PronouncementsFinancial InstrumentsIn June 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments – Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments (“ASU 2016-13”), which modifies the measurement of expected credit losses on certain financial instruments. The Company will adopt ASU 2016-13 in its first quarter of 2021 utilizing the modified retrospective transition method. Based on the composition of the Company’s investment portfolio, current market conditions, and historical credit loss activity, the adoption of ASU 2016-13 will not have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.Apple Inc. | 2020 Form 10-K | 24

Liquidity and Capital ResourcesThe following table presents selected financial information and statistics as of and for the years ended September 26, 2020, September 28, 2019 and September 29, 2018 (in millions):(1)As of September 26, 2020 and September 28, 2019, total marketable securities included $18.6 billion and $18.9 billion, respectively, that was restricted from general use, related to the State Aid Decision (refer to Note 5, “Income Taxes” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K) and other agreements.The Company believes its existing balances of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, along with commercial paper and other short-term liquidity arrangements, will be sufficient to satisfy its working capital needs, capital asset purchases, dividends, share repurchases, debt repayments and other liquidity requirements associated with its existing operations over the next 12 months.In connection with the State Aid Decision, as of September 26, 2020, the adjusted recovery amount of €12.9 billion plus interest of €1.2 billion was funded into escrow, where it will remain restricted from general use pending the conclusion of all legal proceedings. Further information regarding the State Aid Decision can be found in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Note 5, “Income Taxes.”The Company’s marketable securities investment portfolio is primarily invested in highly rated securities, with the primary objective of minimizing the potential risk of principal loss. The Company’s investment policy generally requires securities to be investment grade and limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer.During 2020, cash generated by operating activities of $80.7 billion was a result of $57.4 billion of net income, non-cash adjustments to net income of $17.6 billion and an increase in the net change in operating assets and liabilities of $5.7 billion. Cash used in investing activities of $4.3 billion during 2020 consisted primarily of cash used to acquire property, plant and equipment of $7.3 billion and cash paid for business acquisitions, net of cash acquired, of $1.5 billion, partially offset by proceeds from maturities and sales of marketable securities, net of purchases, of $5.5 billion. Cash used in financing activities of $86.8 billion during 2020 consisted primarily of cash used to repurchase common stock of $72.4 billion, cash used to pay dividends and dividend equivalents of $14.1 billion, cash used to repay or redeem term debt of $12.6 billion and net repayments of commercial paper of $1.0 billion, partially offset by net proceeds from the issuance of term debt of $16.1 billion.During 2019, cash generated by operating activities of $69.4 billion was a result of $55.3 billion of net income and non-cash adjustments to net income of $17.6 billion, partially offset by a decrease in the net change in operating assets and liabilities of $3.5 billion. Cash generated by investing activities of $45.9 billion during 2019 consisted primarily of proceeds from sales and maturities of marketable securities, net of purchases, of $57.5 billion, partially offset by cash used to acquire property, plant and equipment of $10.5 billion. Cash used in financing activities of $91.0 billion during 2019 consisted primarily of cash used to repurchase common stock of $66.9 billion, cash used to pay dividends and dividend equivalents of $14.1 billion, cash used to repay term debt of $8.8 billion and net repayments of commercial paper of $6.0 billion, partially offset by net proceeds from the issuance of term debt of $7.0 billion.DebtThe Company issues unsecured short-term promissory notes (“Commercial Paper”) pursuant to a commercial paper program. The Company uses the net proceeds from the commercial paper program for general corporate purposes, including dividends and share repurchases. As of September 26, 2020, the Company had $5.0 billion of Commercial Paper outstanding, with a weighted-average interest rate of 0.62% and maturities generally less than nine months.The Company may enter into agreements to sell certain of its marketable securities with a promise to repurchase the securities at a specified time and amount as an additional short-term liquidity arrangement.Apple Inc. | 2020 Form 10-K | 25

During 2020, the Company issued $16.1 billion and repaid or redeemed $12.6 billion of Notes. The Company has entered, and in the future may enter, into interest rate swaps to manage interest rate risk on the Notes. In addition, the Company has entered, and in the future may enter, into foreign currency swaps to manage foreign currency risk on the Notes.Further information regarding the Company’s debt issuances and related hedging activity can be found in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Note 3, “Financial Instruments” and Note 6, “Debt.”Capital Return ProgramAs of September 26, 2020, the Company was authorized to purchase up to $225 billion of the Company’s common stock under a share repurchase program, of which $168.6 billion had been utilized. During 2020, the Company repurchased 917 million shares of its common stock for $72.5 billion, including 141 million shares delivered under a $10.0 billion November 2019 ASR and 64 million shares delivered under a $6.0 billion May 2020 ASR. The Company’s share repurchase program does not obligate it to acquire any specific number of shares. Under this program, shares may be repurchased in privately negotiated and/or open market transactions, including under plans complying with Rule 10b5-1 under the Exchange Act.As of September 26, 2020, the Company’s quarterly cash dividend was $0.205 per share. The Company intends to increase its dividend on an annual basis, subject to declaration by the Board of Directors.Contractual ObligationsThe following table presents certain payments due by the Company as of September 26, 2020, and includes amounts already recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, except for manufacturing purchase obligations, other purchase obligations and certain lease obligations (in millions):(1)Represents amount expected to be paid under manufacturing-related supplier arrangements, which are primarily noncancelable.LeasesThe Company has lease arrangements for certain equipment and facilities, including retail, corporate, manufacturing and data center space. The Company’s retail store and other facility leases typically have original terms not exceeding 10 years and generally contain multi-year renewal options. The above contractual obligations table includes future payments under leases that had commenced as of September 26, 2020, and were therefore recorded on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheet, as well as leases that had been signed but not yet commenced as of September 26, 2020. Further information regarding the Company’s leases can be found in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Note 12, “Leases.”Manufacturing Purchase ObligationsThe Company utilizes several outsourcing partners to manufacture sub-assemblies for the Company’s products and to perform final assembly and testing of finished products. These outsourcing partners acquire components and build product based on demand information supplied by the Company, which typically covers periods up to 150 days. The Company also obtains individual components for its products from a wide variety of individual suppliers.Other Purchase ObligationsThe Company’s other purchase obligations consist of noncancelable obligations to acquire capital assets, including product tooling and manufacturing process equipment, and noncancelable obligations related to advertising, licensing, R&D, Internet and telecommunications services, content creation and other activities.Apple Inc. | 2020 Form 10-K | 26



Deemed Repatriation Tax PayableAs of September 26, 2020, a significant portion of the other non-current liabilities in the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheet consisted of the deemed repatriation tax payable imposed by the Act. The Company plans to pay the deemed repatriation tax payable in installments in accordance with the Act.Other Non-Current LiabilitiesThe Company’s remaining other non-current liabilities primarily consist of items for which the Company is unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing or amount of payments; therefore, such amounts are not included in the above contractual obligations table.Critical Accounting Policies and EstimatesThe preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) and the Company’s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and operating results require the Company’s management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported. Note 1, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Company’s consolidated financial statements. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. Actual results may differ from these estimates, and such differences may be material.Management believes the Company’s critical accounting policies and estimates are those related to revenue recognition, valuation of manufacturing-related assets and estimation of inventory purchase commitment cancellation fees, warranty costs, income taxes, and legal and other contingencies. Management considers these policies critical because they are both important to the portrayal of the Company’s financial condition and operating results, and they require management to make judgments and estimates about inherently uncertain matters. The Company’s senior management has reviewed these critical accounting policies and related disclosures with the Audit and Finance Committee of the Company’s Board of Directors.Revenue RecognitionThe Company has identified up to three performance obligations regularly included in arrangements involving the sale of iPhone, Mac, iPad and certain other products. The first performance obligation, which represents the substantial portion of the allocated sales price, is the hardware and bundled software delivered at the time of sale. The second performance obligation is the right to receive certain product-related bundled services, which include iCloud, Siri and Maps. The third performance obligation is the right to receive, on a when-and-if-available basis, future unspecified software upgrades relating to the software bundled with each device. The Company allocates revenue and any related discounts to these performance obligations based on their relative stand-alone selling prices (“SSPs”). Because the Company lacks observable prices for the undelivered performance obligations, the allocation of revenue is based on the Company’s estimated SSPs. Revenue allocated to the product-related bundled services and unspecified software upgrade rights is deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis over the estimated period they are expected to be provided.The Company’s process for determining estimated SSPs involves management’s judgment and considers multiple factors that may vary over time depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each deliverable. Should future facts and circumstances change, the Company’s SSPs and the future rate of related amortization for product-related bundled services and unspecified software upgrade rights related to future sales of these devices could change. Factors subject to change include the nature of the product-related bundled services and unspecified software upgrade rights offered, their estimated value and the estimated period they are expected to be provided.Valuation of Manufacturing-Related Assets and Estimation of Inventory Purchase Commitment Cancellation FeesThe Company invests in manufacturing-related assets, including capital assets held at its suppliers’ facilities and prepayments provided to certain of its suppliers associated with long-term agreements to secure the supply of inventory. The Company also accrues estimated purchase commitment cancellation fees related to inventory orders that have been canceled or are expected to be canceled. The Company’s estimates of future product development plans and demand for its products are key inputs in determining the recoverability of manufacturing-related assets and assessing the adequacy of any purchase commitment cancellation fee accruals. If there is an abrupt and substantial decline in estimated demand for one or more of the Company’s products, a change in the Company’s product development plans, or an unanticipated change in technological requirements for any of the Company’s products, the Company may be required to record write-downs or impairments of manufacturing-related assets or accrue purchase commitment cancellation fees.Apple Inc. | 2020 Form 10-K | 27


## Item 7A


As of September 26, 2020 and September 28, 2019, the Company had outstanding floating- and fixed-rate notes with varying maturities for an aggregate carrying amount of $107.4 billion and $102.1 billion, respectively. The Company has entered, and in the future may enter, into interest rate swaps to manage interest rate risk on its outstanding term debt. Interest rate swaps allow the Company to effectively convert fixed-rate payments into floating-rate payments or floating-rate payments into fixed-rate payments. Gains and losses on term debt are generally offset by the corresponding losses and gains on the related hedging instrument. A 100 basis point increase in market interest rates would cause interest expense on the Company’s debt as of September 26, 2020 and September 28, 2019 to increase by $218 million and $325 million on an annualized basis, respectively.Foreign Currency RiskIn general, the Company is a net receiver of currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Accordingly, changes in exchange rates, and in particular a strengthening of the U.S. dollar, will negatively affect the Company’s net sales and gross margins as expressed in U.S. dollars. There is a risk that the Company will have to adjust local currency pricing due to competitive pressures when there has been significant volatility in foreign currency exchange rates.The Company may enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts with financial institutions to protect against foreign exchange risks associated with certain existing assets and liabilities, certain firmly committed transactions, forecasted future cash flows and net investments in foreign subsidiaries. In addition, the Company has entered, and in the future may enter, into foreign currency contracts to partially offset the foreign currency exchange gains and losses on its foreign currency–denominated debt issuances. The Company generally hedges portions of its forecasted foreign currency exposure associated with revenue and inventory purchases, typically for up to 12 months. However, the Company may choose not to hedge certain foreign exchange exposures for a variety of reasons including, but not limited to, accounting considerations or the prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures.To provide an assessment of the foreign currency risk associated with certain of the Company’s foreign currency derivative positions, the Company performed a sensitivity analysis using a value-at-risk (“VAR”) model to assess the potential impact of fluctuations in exchange rates. The VAR model consisted of using a Monte Carlo simulation to generate thousands of random market price paths assuming normal market conditions. The VAR is the maximum expected loss in fair value, for a given confidence interval, to the Company’s foreign currency derivative positions due to adverse movements in rates. The VAR model is not intended to represent actual losses but is used as a risk estimation and management tool. Forecasted transactions, firm commitments and assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies were excluded from the model. Based on the results of the model, the Company estimates with 95% confidence, a maximum one-day loss in fair value of $551 million as of September 26, 2020, compared to a maximum one-day loss in fair value of $452 million as of September 28, 2019. Because the Company uses foreign currency instruments for hedging purposes, the losses in fair value incurred on those instruments are generally offset by increases in the fair value of the underlying exposures.Actual future gains and losses associated with the Company’s investment portfolio, debt and derivative positions may differ materially from the sensitivity analyses performed as of September 26, 2020 due to the inherent limitations associated with predicting the timing and amount of changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and the Company’s actual exposures and positions.Apple Inc. | 2020 Form 10-K | 29

Apple Inc.Notes to Consolidated Financial StatementsNote 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting PoliciesBasis of Presentation and PreparationThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Apple Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries (collectively “Apple” or the “Company”). Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. In the opinion of the Company’s management, the consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments, which are normal and recurring in nature, necessary for fair financial statement presentation. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates. Certain prior period amounts in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been reclassified to conform to the current period’s presentation.The Company’s fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week period that ends on the last Saturday of September. The Company’s fiscal years 2020, 2019 and 2018 spanned 52 weeks each. An additional week is included in the first fiscal quarter every five or six years to realign the Company’s fiscal quarters with calendar quarters. Unless otherwise stated, references to particular years, quarters, months and periods refer to the Company’s fiscal years ended in September and the associated quarters, months and periods of those fiscal years.Common Stock SplitOn August 28, 2020, the Company effected a four-for-one stock split to shareholders of record as of August 24, 2020. All share, restricted stock unit (“RSU”) and per share or per RSU information has been retroactively adjusted to reflect the stock split.Recently Adopted Accounting PronouncementsLeasesAt the beginning of the first quarter of 2020, the Company adopted the Financial Accounting Standards Board’s (the “FASB”) Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) (“ASU 2016-02”), and additional ASUs issued to clarify and update the guidance in ASU 2016-02 (collectively, the “new leases standard”), which modifies lease accounting for lessees to increase transparency and comparability by recording lease assets and liabilities for operating leases and disclosing key information about leasing arrangements. The Company adopted the new leases standard utilizing the modified retrospective transition method, under which amounts in prior periods presented were not restated. For contracts existing at the time of adoption, the Company elected to not reassess (i) whether any are or contain leases, (ii) lease classification, and (iii) initial direct costs. Upon adoption, the Company recorded $7.5 billion of right-of-use (“ROU”) assets and $8.1 billion of lease liabilities on its Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet.HedgingAt the beginning of the first quarter of 2020, the Company adopted FASB ASU No. 2017-12, Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities (“ASU 2017-12”). ASU 2017-12 expands component and fair value hedging, specifies the presentation of the effects of hedging instruments, eliminates the separate measurement and presentation of hedge ineffectiveness, and updates disclosure requirements related to hedging. The Company adopted ASU 2017-12 utilizing the modified retrospective transition method. Upon adoption, the Company recorded a $136 million increase in accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss) (“AOCI”) and a corresponding decrease in retained earnings in the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Shareholders’ Equity.Advertising CostsAdvertising costs are expensed as incurred and included in selling, general and administrative expenses.Share-Based CompensationThe Company generally measures share-based compensation based on the closing price of the Company’s common stock on the date of grant, and recognizes expense on a straight-line basis for its estimate of equity awards that will ultimately vest. Further information regarding share-based compensation can be found in Note 9, “Benefit Plans.”Apple Inc. | 2020 Form 10-K | 36

Earnings Per ShareThe following table shows the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share for 2020, 2019 and 2018 (net income in millions and shares in thousands):The Company applies the treasury stock method to determine the dilutive effect of potentially dilutive securities. Potentially dilutive securities representing 62 million shares of common stock were excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share for 2019 because their effect would have been antidilutive.Cash Equivalents and Marketable SecuritiesAll highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase are classified as cash equivalents.The Company’s investments in marketable debt securities have been classified and accounted for as available-for-sale. The Company classifies its marketable debt securities as either short-term or long-term based on each instrument’s underlying contractual maturity date. Unrealized gains and losses on marketable debt securities classified as available-for-sale are recognized in other comprehensive income/(loss) (“OCI”). The Company’s investments in marketable equity securities are classified based on the nature of the securities and their availability for use in current operations. The Company’s marketable equity securities are measured at fair value with gains and losses recognized in other income/(expense), net (“OI&E”).The cost of securities sold is determined using the specific identification method.InventoriesInventories are measured using the first-in, first-out method.Property, Plant and EquipmentDepreciation on property, plant and equipment is recognized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which for buildings is the lesser of 40 years or the remaining life of the building; between one and five years for machinery and equipment, including product tooling and manufacturing process equipment; and the shorter of lease term or useful life for leasehold improvements. Capitalized costs related to internal-use software are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which range from three to seven years. Depreciation and amortization expense on property and equipment was $9.7 billion, $11.3 billion and $9.3 billion during 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.Non-cash investing activities involving property, plant and equipment resulted in a net increase/(decrease) to accounts payable and other current liabilities of $(2.9) billion and $3.4 billion during 2019 and 2018, respectively.Apple Inc. | 2020 Form 10-K | 37



Non-Marketable SecuritiesThe Company has elected to apply the measurement alternative to equity securities without readily determinable fair values. As such, the Company’s non-marketable equity securities are measured at cost, less any impairment, and are adjusted for changes in fair value resulting from observable transactions for identical or similar investments of the same issuer. Gains and losses on non-marketable equity securities are recognized in OI&E.Restricted Cash and Restricted Marketable SecuritiesThe Company considers cash and marketable securities to be restricted when withdrawal or general use is legally restricted. The Company reports restricted cash as other assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, and determines current or non-current classification based on the expected duration of the restriction. The Company reports restricted marketable securities as current or non-current marketable securities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets based on the classification of the underlying securities.Fair Value MeasurementsThe fair values of the Company’s money market funds and certain marketable equity securities are based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets. The valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of the Company’s debt instruments and all other financial instruments, which generally have counterparties with high credit ratings, are based on quoted market prices or model-driven valuations using significant inputs derived from or corroborated by observable market data.Note 2 – Revenue RecognitionNet sales consist of revenue from the sale of iPhone, Mac, iPad, Services and other products. The Company recognizes revenue at the amount to which it expects to be entitled when control of the products or services is transferred to its customers. Control is generally transferred when the Company has a present right to payment and title and the significant risks and rewards of ownership of products or services are transferred to its customers. For most of the Company’s Products net sales, control transfers when products are shipped. For the Company’s Services net sales, control transfers over time as services are delivered. Payment for Products and Services net sales is collected within a short period following transfer of control or commencement of delivery of services, as applicable.The Company records reductions to Products net sales related to future product returns, price protection and other customer incentive programs based on the Company’s expectations and historical experience.For arrangements with multiple performance obligations, which represent promises within an arrangement that are distinct, the Company allocates revenue to all distinct performance obligations based on their relative stand-alone selling prices (“SSPs”). When available, the Company uses observable prices to determine SSPs. When observable prices are not available, SSPs are established that reflect the Company’s best estimates of what the selling prices of the performance obligations would be if they were sold regularly on a stand-alone basis. The Company’s process for estimating SSPs without observable prices considers multiple factors that may vary depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each performance obligation including, where applicable, prices charged by the Company for similar offerings, market trends in the pricing for similar offerings, product-specific business objectives and the estimated cost to provide the performance obligation.The Company has identified up to three performance obligations regularly included in arrangements involving the sale of iPhone, Mac, iPad and certain other products. The first performance obligation, which represents the substantial portion of the allocated sales price, is the hardware and bundled software delivered at the time of sale. The second performance obligation is the right to receive certain product-related bundled services, which include iCloud, Siri and Maps. The third performance obligation is the right to receive, on a when-and-if-available basis, future unspecified software upgrades relating to the software bundled with each device. The Company allocates revenue and any related discounts to these performance obligations based on their relative SSPs. Because the Company lacks observable prices for the undelivered performance obligations, the allocation of revenue is based on the Company’s estimated SSPs. Revenue allocated to the delivered hardware and bundled software is recognized when control has transferred to the customer, which generally occurs when the product is shipped. Revenue allocated to the product-related bundled services and unspecified software upgrade rights is deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis over the estimated period they are expected to be provided. Cost of sales related to delivered hardware and bundled software, including estimated warranty costs, are recognized at the time of sale. Costs incurred to provide product-related bundled services and unspecified software upgrade rights are recognized as cost of sales as incurred.For certain long-term service arrangements, the Company has performance obligations for services it has not yet delivered. For these arrangements, the Company does not have a right to bill for the undelivered services. The Company has determined that any unbilled consideration relates entirely to the value of the undelivered services. Accordingly, the Company has not recognized revenue, and has elected not to disclose amounts, related to these undelivered services.Apple Inc. | 2020 Form 10-K | 38

For the sale of third-party products where the Company obtains control of the product before transferring it to the customer, the Company recognizes revenue based on the gross amount billed to customers. The Company considers multiple factors when determining whether it obtains control of third-party products including, but not limited to, evaluating if it can establish the price of the product, retains inventory risk for tangible products or has the responsibility for ensuring acceptability of the product. For third-party applications sold through the App Store and certain digital content sold through the Company’s other digital content stores, the Company does not obtain control of the product before transferring it to the customer. Therefore, the Company accounts for such sales on a net basis by recognizing in Services net sales only the commission it retains.The Company has elected to record revenue net of taxes collected from customers that are remitted to governmental authorities, with the collected taxes recorded within other current liabilities until remitted to the relevant government authority.Deferred RevenueAs of September 26, 2020 and September 28, 2019, the Company had total deferred revenue of $10.2 billion and $8.1 billion, respectively. As of September 26, 2020, the Company expects 65% of total deferred revenue to be realized in less than a year, 25% within one-to-two years, 8% within two-to-three years and 2% in greater than three years.Disaggregated RevenueNet sales disaggregated by significant products and services for 2020, 2019 and 2018 were as follows (in millions):(1)Products net sales include amortization of the deferred value of unspecified software upgrade rights, which are bundled in the sales price of the respective product.(2)Wearables, Home and Accessories net sales include sales of AirPods, Apple TV, Apple Watch, Beats products, HomePod, iPod touch and Apple-branded and third-party accessories.(3)Services net sales include sales from the Company’s advertising, AppleCare, digital content and other services.

The Company may sell certain of its marketable debt securities prior to their stated maturities for reasons including, but not limited to, managing liquidity, credit risk, duration and asset allocation. The maturities of the Company’s non-current marketable debt securities generally range from one to five years.The Company typically invests in highly rated securities, with the primary objective of minimizing the potential risk of principal loss. The Company’s investment policy generally requires securities to be investment grade and limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. Fair values were determined for each individual security in the investment portfolio. When evaluating a marketable debt security for other-than-temporary impairment, the Company reviews factors such as the duration and extent to which the fair value of the security is less than its cost, the financial condition of the issuer and any changes thereto, and the Company’s intent to sell, or whether it will more likely than not be required to sell, the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis. As of September 26, 2020, the Company does not consider any of its marketable debt securities to be other-than-temporarily impaired.Non-Marketable SecuritiesThe Company holds non-marketable equity securities of certain privately held companies without readily determinable fair values. As of September 26, 2020 and September 28, 2019, the Company’s non-marketable equity securities had a carrying value of $2.8 billion and $2.9 billion, respectively.Restricted CashA reconciliation of the Company’s cash and cash equivalents in the Consolidated Balance Sheets to cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows as of September 26, 2020 and September 28, 2019 is as follows (in millions):The Company’s restricted cash primarily consisted of cash to support the Company’s iPhone Upgrade Program.Derivative Financial InstrumentsThe Company may use derivatives to partially offset its business exposure to foreign currency and interest rate risk on expected future cash flows, net investments in certain foreign subsidiaries, and certain existing assets and liabilities. However, the Company may choose not to hedge certain exposures for a variety of reasons including, but not limited to, accounting considerations or the prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures. There can be no assurance the hedges will offset more than a portion of the financial impact resulting from movements in foreign currency exchange or interest rates.To protect gross margins from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, certain of the Company’s subsidiaries whose functional currency is the U.S. dollar may hedge a portion of forecasted foreign currency revenue, and subsidiaries whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar may hedge a portion of forecasted inventory purchases not denominated in the subsidiaries’ functional currencies. The Company may enter into forward contracts, option contracts or other instruments to manage this risk and may designate these instruments as cash flow hedges. The Company generally hedges portions of its forecasted foreign currency exposure associated with revenue and inventory purchases, typically for up to 12 months.To protect the net investment in a foreign operation from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, the Company may enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts to offset a portion of the changes in the carrying amounts of these investments due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. In addition, the Company may use non-derivative financial instruments, such as its foreign currency–denominated debt, as hedges of its net investments in certain foreign subsidiaries. In both of these cases, the Company designates these instruments as net investment hedges.To protect the Company’s foreign currency–denominated term debt or marketable securities from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, the Company may enter into forward contracts, cross-currency swaps or other instruments. These instruments may offset a portion of the foreign currency remeasurement gains or losses, or changes in fair value. The Company may designate these instruments as either cash flow or fair value hedges. As of September 26, 2020, the Company’s hedged term debt– and marketable securities–related foreign currency transactions are expected to be recognized within 22 years.The Company may also enter into non-designated foreign currency contracts to offset a portion of the foreign currency exchange gains and losses generated by the remeasurement of certain assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies.Apple Inc. | 2020 Form 10-K | 41

To protect the Company’s foreign currency–denominated term debt or marketable securities from fluctuations in interest rates, the Company may enter into interest rate swaps, options or other instruments. These instruments may offset a portion of the changes in interest income or expense, or changes in fair value. The Company designates these instruments as either cash flow or fair value hedges. As of September 26, 2020, the Company’s hedged interest rate transactions are expected to be recognized within seven years.Cash Flow HedgesCash flow hedge amounts that are included in the assessment of hedge effectiveness are deferred in AOCI until the hedged item is recognized in earnings. Deferred gains and losses associated with cash flow hedges of foreign currency revenue are recognized as a component of net sales in the same period as the related revenue is recognized, and deferred gains and losses related to cash flow hedges of inventory purchases are recognized as a component of cost of sales in the same period as the related costs are recognized. Deferred gains and losses associated with cash flow hedges of interest income or expense are recognized in OI&E in the same period as the related income or expense is recognized. For options designated as cash flow hedges, the time value is excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and recognized in the financial statement line item to which the hedge relates on a straight-line basis over the life of the hedge. Changes in the fair value of amounts excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness are recognized in OCI.Derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges must be de-designated as hedges when it is probable the forecasted hedged transaction will not occur in the initially identified time period or within a subsequent two-month time period. Deferred gains and losses in AOCI associated with such derivative instruments are reclassified into OI&E in the period of de-designation. Any subsequent changes in fair value of such derivative instruments are reflected in OI&E unless they are re-designated as hedges of other transactions.Net Investment HedgesNet investment hedge amounts that are included in the assessment of hedge effectiveness are recorded in OCI as a part of the cumulative translation adjustment. For foreign exchange forward contracts designated as net investment hedges, the forward carry component is excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and recognized in OCI on a straight-line basis over the life of the hedge. Changes in the fair value of amounts excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness are recognized in OCI.Fair Value HedgesFair value hedge gains and losses related to amounts that are included in the assessment of hedge effectiveness are recognized in earnings along with a corresponding loss or gain related to the change in value of the hedged item in the same line in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. For foreign exchange forward contracts designated as fair value hedges, the forward carry component is excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and recognized in OI&E on a straight-line basis over the life of the hedge. Amounts excluded from the effectiveness assessment of fair value hedges and recognized in OI&E were gains of $465 million and $777 million for 2020 and 2019, respectively. Changes in the fair value of amounts excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness are recognized in OCI.Non-Designated DerivativesDerivatives that are not designated as hedging instruments are adjusted to fair value through earnings in the financial statement line item to which the derivative relates.The Company records all derivatives in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value. The Company’s accounting treatment for these derivative instruments is based on its hedge designation.

The following tables show information about the Company’s derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges and the related hedged items for 2020, 2019 and 2018 and as of September 26, 2020 (in millions):(1)Gains and losses related to fair value hedges are included in OI&E in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.(2)The carrying amounts of marketable securities that are designated as hedged items in fair value hedges are included in current marketable securities and non-current marketable securities in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.(3)The carrying amounts of fixed-rate debt instruments that are designated as hedged items in fair value hedges are included in current term debt and non-current term debt in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.The following table shows the notional amounts of the Company’s outstanding derivative instruments and credit risk amounts associated with outstanding or unsettled derivative instruments as of September 26, 2020 and September 28, 2019 (in millions):The notional amounts for outstanding derivative instruments provide one measure of the transaction volume outstanding and do not represent the amount of the Company’s exposure to credit or market loss. The credit risk amounts represent the Company’s gross exposure to potential accounting loss on derivative instruments that are outstanding or unsettled if all counterparties failed to perform according to the terms of the contract, based on then-current currency or interest rates at each respective date. The Company’s exposure to credit loss and market risk will vary over time as currency and interest rates change. Although the table above reflects the notional and credit risk amounts of the Company’s derivative instruments, it does not reflect the gains or losses associated with the exposures and transactions that the instruments are intended to hedge. The amounts ultimately realized upon settlement of these financial instruments, together with the gains and losses on the underlying exposures, will depend on actual market conditions during the remaining life of the instruments.Apple Inc. | 2020 Form 10-K | 44

The Company generally enters into master netting arrangements, which are designed to reduce credit risk by permitting net settlement of transactions with the same counterparty. To further limit credit risk, the Company generally enters into collateral security arrangements that provide for collateral to be received or posted when the net fair value of certain financial instruments fluctuates from contractually established thresholds. The Company presents its derivative assets and derivative liabilities at their gross fair values in its Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of September 26, 2020 and September 28, 2019, the net cash collateral received by the Company related to derivative instruments under its collateral security arrangements was $875 million and $1.6 billion, respectively. The Company includes gross collateral posted and received in other current assets and other current liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, respectively.Under master netting arrangements with the respective counterparties to the Company’s derivative contracts, the Company is allowed to net settle transactions with a single net amount payable by one party to the other. As of September 26, 2020 and September 28, 2019, the potential effects of these rights of set-off associated with the Company’s derivative contracts, including the effects of collateral, would be a reduction to both derivative assets and derivative liabilities of $2.8 billion and $2.7 billion, respectively, resulting in net derivative liabilities of $312 million and $407 million, respectively.Accounts ReceivableTrade ReceivablesThe Company has considerable trade receivables outstanding with its third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers, resellers, small and mid-sized businesses and education, enterprise and government customers. The Company generally does not require collateral from its customers; however, the Company will require collateral or third-party credit support in certain instances to limit credit risk. In addition, when possible, the Company attempts to limit credit risk on trade receivables with credit insurance for certain customers or by requiring third-party financing, loans or leases to support credit exposure. These credit-financing arrangements are directly between the third-party financing company and the end customer. As such, the Company generally does not assume any recourse or credit risk sharing related to any of these arrangements.As of both September 26, 2020 and September 28, 2019, the Company had no customers that individually represented 10% or more of total trade receivables. The Company’s cellular network carriers accounted for 51% of total trade receivables as of September 28, 2019.Vendor Non-Trade ReceivablesThe Company has non-trade receivables from certain of its manufacturing vendors resulting from the sale of components to these vendors who manufacture sub-assemblies or assemble final products for the Company. The Company purchases these components directly from suppliers. As of September 26, 2020, the Company had two vendors that individually represented 10% or more of total vendor non-trade receivables, which accounted for 57% and 11%. As of September 28, 2019, the Company had two vendors that individually represented 10% or more of total vendor non-trade receivables, which accounted for 59% and 14%.Note 4 – Consolidated Financial Statement DetailsThe following tables show the Company’s consolidated financial statement details as of September 26, 2020 and September 28, 2019 (in millions):Property, Plant and Equipment, NetOther Non-Current LiabilitiesApple Inc. | 2020 Form 10-K | 45

The Act lowered the Company’s U.S. statutory federal income tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018, while also imposing a deemed repatriation tax on previously deferred foreign income. The Act also created a new minimum tax on certain foreign earnings, for which the Company has elected to record certain deferred tax assets and liabilities.Provision for Income Taxes and Effective Tax RateThe provision for income taxes for 2020, 2019 and 2018, consisted of the following (in millions):The foreign provision for income taxes is based on foreign pre-tax earnings of $38.1 billion, $44.3 billion and $48.0 billion in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.A reconciliation of the provision for income taxes, with the amount computed by applying the statutory federal income tax rate (21% in 2020 and 2019; 24.5% in 2018) to income before provision for income taxes for 2020, 2019 and 2018, is as follows (dollars in millions):Apple Inc. | 2020 Form 10-K | 46

Deferred Tax Assets and LiabilitiesAs of September 26, 2020 and September 28, 2019, the significant components of the Company’s deferred tax assets and liabilities were (in millions):Deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect the effects of tax credits and the future income tax effects of temporary differences between the consolidated financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, and are measured using enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.Uncertain Tax PositionsAs of September 26, 2020, the total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits was $16.5 billion, of which $8.8 billion, if recognized, would impact the Company’s effective tax rate. As of September 28, 2019, the total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits was $15.6 billion, of which $8.6 billion, if recognized, would have impacted the Company’s effective tax rate.The aggregate change in the balance of gross unrecognized tax benefits, which excludes interest and penalties, for 2020, 2019 and 2018, is as follows (in millions):The Company is subject to taxation and files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and many state and foreign jurisdictions. The U.S. Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”) concluded its review of the years 2013 through 2015 in 2018, and all years before 2016 are closed. Tax years after 2014 remain open in certain major foreign jurisdictions and are subject to examination by the taxing authorities. The Company believes that an adequate provision has been made for any adjustments that may result from tax examinations. However, the outcome of tax audits cannot be predicted with certainty. If any issues addressed in the Company’s tax audits are resolved in a manner inconsistent with its expectations, the Company could be required to adjust its provision for income taxes in the period such resolution occurs. Although the timing of resolution and/or closure of audits is not certain, the Company believes it is reasonably possible that its gross unrecognized tax benefits could decrease in the next 12 months by as much as $3.9 billion.Apple Inc. | 2020 Form 10-K | 47

Interest and PenaltiesThe Company includes interest and penalties related to income tax matters within the provision for income taxes. As of September 26, 2020 and September 28, 2019, the total amount of gross interest and penalties accrued was $1.4 billion and $1.3 billion, respectively. The Company recognized interest and penalty expense in 2020, 2019 and 2018 of $85 million, $73 million and $489 million, respectively.European Commission State Aid DecisionOn August 30, 2016, the European Commission announced its decision that Ireland granted state aid to the Company by providing tax opinions in 1991 and 2007 concerning the tax allocation of profits of the Irish branches of two subsidiaries of the Company (the “State Aid Decision”). The State Aid Decision ordered Ireland to calculate and recover additional taxes from the Company for the period June 2003 through December 2014. Irish legislative changes, effective as of January 2015, eliminated the application of the tax opinions from that date forward. The recovery amount was calculated to be €13.1 billion, plus interest of €1.2 billion. The Company and Ireland appealed the State Aid Decision to the General Court of the Court of Justice of the European Union (the “General Court”). On July 15, 2020, the General Court annulled the State Aid Decision. On September 25, 2020, the European Commission appealed the General Court’s decision to the European Court of Justice. The Company believes that any incremental Irish corporate income taxes potentially due related to the State Aid Decision would be creditable against U.S. taxes, subject to any foreign tax credit limitations in the Act.On an annual basis, the Company may request approval from the Irish Minister for Finance to reduce the recovery amount for certain taxes paid to other countries. As of September 26, 2020, the adjusted recovery amount was €12.9 billion, excluding interest. The adjusted recovery amount plus interest is funded into escrow, where it will remain restricted from general use pending the conclusion of all legal proceedings. Refer to the Cash, Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities section of Note 3, “Financial Instruments” for more information.Note 6 – DebtCommercial Paper and Repurchase AgreementsThe Company issues unsecured short-term promissory notes (“Commercial Paper”) pursuant to a commercial paper program. The Company uses net proceeds from the commercial paper program for general corporate purposes, including dividends and share repurchases. As of September 26, 2020 and September 28, 2019, the Company had $5.0 billion and $6.0 billion of Commercial Paper outstanding, respectively, with maturities generally less than nine months. The weighted-average interest rate of the Company’s Commercial Paper was 0.62% and 2.24% as of September 26, 2020 and September 28, 2019, respectively. The following table provides a summary of cash flows associated with the issuance and maturities of Commercial Paper for 2020, 2019 and 2018 (in millions):In 2020, the Company entered into agreements to sell certain of its marketable securities with a promise to repurchase the securities at a specified time and amount (“Repos”). Due to the Company’s continuing involvement with the marketable securities, the Company accounted for its Repos as collateralized borrowings. The Company entered into $5.2 billion of Repos during 2020, all of which had been settled as of September 26, 2020.Apple Inc. | 2020 Form 10-K | 48

Term DebtAs of September 26, 2020, the Company had outstanding floating- and fixed-rate notes with varying maturities for an aggregate principal amount of $106.1 billion (collectively the “Notes”). The Notes are senior unsecured obligations and interest is payable in arrears. The following table provides a summary of the Company’s term debt as of September 26, 2020 and September 28, 2019:To manage interest rate risk on certain of its U.S. dollar–denominated fixed- or floating-rate notes, the Company has entered into interest rate swaps to effectively convert the fixed interest rates to floating interest rates or the floating interest rates to fixed interest rates on a portion of these notes. Additionally, to manage foreign currency risk on certain of its foreign currency–denominated notes, the Company has entered into foreign currency swaps to effectively convert these notes to U.S. dollar–denominated notes.As of September 28, 2019, a portion of the Company’s Japanese yen–denominated notes with a carrying value of $1.0 billion was designated as a hedge of the foreign currency exposure of the Company’s net investment in a foreign operation. The Company’s Japanese yen–denominated notes matured during 2020 and the associated net investment hedges were terminated. For further discussion regarding the Company’s use of derivative instruments, refer to the Derivative Financial Instruments section of Note 3, “Financial Instruments.”The effective interest rates for the Notes include the interest on the Notes, amortization of the discount or premium and, if applicable, adjustments related to hedging. The Company recognized $2.8 billion, $3.2 billion and $3.0 billion of interest cost on its term debt for 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.The future principal payments for the Company’s Notes as of September 26, 2020, are as follows (in millions):As of September 26, 2020 and September 28, 2019, the fair value of the Company’s Notes, based on Level 2 inputs, was $117.1 billion and $107.5 billion, respectively.Apple Inc. | 2020 Form 10-K | 49

Note 7 – Shareholders’ EquityShare Repurchase ProgramAs of September 26, 2020, the Company was authorized to purchase up to $225 billion of the Company’s common stock under a share repurchase program, of which $168.6 billion had been utilized. During 2020, the Company repurchased 917 million shares of its common stock for $72.5 billion, including 141 million shares delivered under a $10.0 billion November 2019 accelerated share repurchase arrangement (“ASR”) and 64 million shares delivered under a $6.0 billion May 2020 ASR. The Company’s share repurchase program does not obligate it to acquire any specific number of shares. Under this program, shares may be repurchased in privately negotiated and/or open market transactions, including under plans complying with Rule 10b5-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”).Shares of Common StockThe following table shows the changes in shares of common stock for 2020, 2019 and 2018 (in thousands):Note 8 – Comprehensive IncomeThe Company’s OCI consists of foreign currency translation adjustments from those subsidiaries not using the U.S. dollar as their functional currency, net deferred gains and losses on certain derivative instruments accounted for as cash flow hedges and unrealized gains and losses on marketable debt securities classified as available-for-sale.The following table shows the pre-tax amounts reclassified from AOCI into the Consolidated Statements of Operations, and the associated financial statement line items, for 2020 and 2019 (in millions):Apple Inc. | 2020 Form 10-K | 50

The 2014 Plan provides for broad-based equity grants to employees, including executive officers, and permits the granting of RSUs, stock grants, performance-based awards, stock options and stock appreciation rights, as well as cash bonus awards. RSUs granted under the 2014 Plan generally vest over four years, based on continued employment, and are settled upon vesting in shares of the Company’s common stock on a one-for-one basis. RSUs granted under the 2014 Plan reduce the number of shares available for grant under the plan by a factor of two times the number of RSUs granted. RSUs canceled and shares withheld to satisfy tax withholding obligations increase the number of shares available for grant under the 2014 Plan utilizing a factor of two times the number of RSUs canceled or shares withheld. Currently, all RSUs granted under the 2014 Plan have dividend equivalent rights (“DERs”), which entitle holders of RSUs to the same dividend value per share as holders of common stock. DERs are subject to the same vesting and other terms and conditions as the corresponding unvested RSUs. DERs are accumulated and paid when the underlying shares vest. Upon approval of the 2014 Plan, the Company reserved 1.54 billion shares plus the number of shares remaining that were reserved but not issued under the 2003 Plan. Shares subject to outstanding awards under the 2003 Plan that expire, are canceled or otherwise terminate, or are withheld to satisfy tax withholding obligations for RSUs, will also be available for awards under the 2014 Plan. As of September 26, 2020, approximately 808 million shares were reserved for future issuance under the 2014 Plan.Apple Inc. Non-Employee Director Stock PlanThe Apple Inc. Non-Employee Director Stock Plan (the “Director Plan”) is a shareholder-approved plan that (i) permits the Company to grant awards of RSUs or stock options to the Company’s non-employee directors, (ii) provides for automatic initial grants of RSUs upon a non-employee director joining the Board of Directors and automatic annual grants of RSUs at each annual meeting of shareholders, and (iii) permits the Board of Directors to prospectively change the value and relative mixture of stock options and RSUs for the initial and annual award grants and the methodology for determining the number of shares of the Company’s common stock subject to these grants, in each case within the limits set forth in the Director Plan and without further shareholder approval. RSUs granted under the Director Plan reduce the number of shares available for grant under the plan by a factor of two times the number of RSUs granted. The Director Plan expires on November 12, 2027. All RSUs granted under the Director Plan are entitled to DERs. DERs are subject to the same vesting and other terms and conditions as the corresponding unvested RSUs. DERs are accumulated and paid when the underlying shares vest. As of September 26, 2020, approximately 4 million shares were reserved for future issuance under the Director Plan.Apple Inc. | 2020 Form 10-K | 51

Rule 10b5-1 Trading PlansDuring the three months ended September 26, 2020, Section 16 officers Katherine L. Adams, Timothy D. Cook, Chris Kondo, Luca Maestri, Deirdre O’Brien and Jeffrey Williams had equity trading plans in place in accordance with Rule 10b5-1(c)(1) under the Exchange Act. An equity trading plan is a written document that pre-establishes the amounts, prices and dates (or formula for determining the amounts, prices and dates) of future purchases or sales of the Company’s stock, including shares acquired under the Company’s employee and director equity plans.Employee Stock Purchase PlanThe Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the “Purchase Plan”) is a shareholder-approved plan under which substantially all employees may purchase the Company’s common stock through payroll deductions at a price equal to 85% of the lower of the fair market values of the stock as of the beginning or the end of six-month offering periods. An employee’s payroll deductions under the Purchase Plan are limited to 10% of the employee’s compensation and employees may not purchase more than $25,000 of stock during any calendar year. As of September 26, 2020, approximately 107 million shares were reserved for future issuance under the Purchase Plan.401(k) PlanThe Company’s 401(k) Plan is a deferred salary arrangement under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code. Under the 401(k) Plan, participating U.S. employees may defer a portion of their pre-tax earnings, up to the IRS annual contribution limit ($19,500 for calendar year 2020). The Company matches 50% to 100% of each employee’s contributions, depending on length of service, up to a maximum of 6% of the employee’s eligible earnings.Restricted Stock UnitsA summary of the Company’s RSU activity and related information for 2020, 2019 and 2018, is as follows:The fair value as of the respective vesting dates of RSUs was $10.8 billion, $8.6 billion and $7.6 billion for 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The majority of RSUs that vested in 2020, 2019 and 2018 were net share settled such that the Company withheld shares with a value equivalent to the employees’ obligation for the applicable income and other employment taxes, and remitted the cash to the appropriate taxing authorities. The total shares withheld were approximately 56 million, 59 million and 64 million for 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively, and were based on the value of the RSUs on their respective vesting dates as determined by the Company’s closing stock price. Total payments for the employees’ tax obligations to taxing authorities were $3.9 billion, $3.0 billion and $2.7 billion in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.Apple Inc. | 2020 Form 10-K | 52

Share-Based CompensationThe following table shows share-based compensation expense and the related income tax benefit included in the Consolidated Statements of Operations for 2020, 2019 and 2018 (in millions):As of September 26, 2020, the total unrecognized compensation cost related to outstanding RSUs and stock options was $12.2 billion, which the Company expects to recognize over a weighted-average period of 2.6 years.Note 10 – Commitments and ContingenciesAccrued Warranty and GuaranteesThe following table shows changes in the Company’s accrued warranties and related costs for 2020, 2019 and 2018 (in millions):The Company offers an iPhone Upgrade Program, which is available to customers who purchase a qualifying iPhone in the U.S., the U.K. and China mainland. The iPhone Upgrade Program provides customers the right to trade in that iPhone for a specified amount when purchasing a new iPhone, provided certain conditions are met. The Company accounts for the trade-in right as a guarantee liability and recognizes arrangement revenue net of the fair value of such right, with subsequent changes to the guarantee liability recognized within net sales.Concentrations in the Available Sources of Supply of Materials and ProductAlthough most components essential to the Company’s business are generally available from multiple sources, certain components are currently obtained from single or limited sources. The Company also competes for various components with other participants in the markets for smartphones, personal computers, tablets and other electronic devices. Therefore, many components used by the Company, including those that are available from multiple sources, are at times subject to industry-wide shortage and significant commodity pricing fluctuations.The Company uses some custom components that are not commonly used by its competitors, and new products introduced by the Company often utilize custom components available from only one source. When a component or product uses new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers’ yields have matured or their manufacturing capacities have increased. The continued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at all, may be affected if suppliers decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the Company’s requirements.The Company has entered into agreements for the supply of many components; however, there can be no guarantee that the Company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms, or at all.Substantially all of the Company’s hardware products are manufactured by outsourcing partners that are located primarily in Asia, with some Mac computers manufactured in the U.S. and Ireland.Apple Inc. | 2020 Form 10-K | 53

Unconditional Purchase ObligationsThe Company has entered into certain off–balance sheet commitments that require the future purchase of goods or services (“unconditional purchase obligations”). The Company’s unconditional purchase obligations primarily consist of payments for supplier arrangements, Internet and telecommunication services, intellectual property licenses and content creation. Future payments under noncancelable unconditional purchase obligations having a remaining term in excess of one year as of September 26, 2020, are as follows (in millions):ContingenciesThe Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that have arisen in the ordinary course of business and that have not been fully resolved. The outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain. If one or more legal matters were resolved against the Company in a reporting period for amounts above management’s expectations, the Company’s financial condition and operating results for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected. In the opinion of management, there was not at least a reasonable possibility the Company may have incurred a material loss, or a material loss greater than a recorded accrual, concerning loss contingencies for asserted legal and other claims, except for the following matters:VirnetXVirnetX, Inc. (“VirnetX”) filed a lawsuit against the Company alleging that certain of the Company’s products infringe on patents owned by VirnetX. On April 11, 2018, a jury returned a verdict against the Company and awarded damages of $503 million. The Company appealed the verdict to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, which remanded the case back to the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas, where it is scheduled for a re-trial in October 2020. The Company has challenged the validity of the patents at issue in the re-trial at the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (the “PTO”), and the PTO has declared the patents invalid, subject to further appeal by VirnetX.iOS Performance Management CasesVarious civil litigation matters have been filed in state and federal courts in the U.S. and in various international jurisdictions alleging violation of consumer protection laws, fraud, computer intrusion and other causes of action related to the Company’s performance management feature used in its iPhone operating systems, introduced to certain iPhones in iOS updates 10.2.1 and 11.2. The claims seek monetary damages and other non-monetary relief. On April 5, 2018, several U.S. federal actions were consolidated through a Multidistrict Litigation process into a single action in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California (the “Northern California District Court”). On February 28, 2020, the parties in the Multidistrict Litigation reached a settlement to resolve the U.S. federal and California state class actions. Under the terms of the settlement, which the Northern California District Court preliminarily approved in May 2020, the Company has agreed to pay up to $500 million in the aggregate to certain U.S. owners of iPhones if certain conditions are met. The final amount of the settlement will be determined based on the number of consumers who file valid claims and the attorneys’ fee award. However, the Company has agreed to pay at least $310 million to settle the claims. In addition to civil litigation, the Company is also responding to governmental investigations and requests for information relating to the performance management feature. The Company continues to believe that its iPhones were not defective, that the performance management feature introduced with iOS updates 10.2.1 and 11.2 was intended to, and did, improve customers’ user experience, and that the Company did not make any misleading statements or fail to disclose any material information. The Company has accrued its best estimate for the ultimate resolution of these matters.French Competition AuthorityOn March 16, 2020, the French Competition Authority (“FCA”) announced its decision that aspects of the Company’s sales and distribution practices in France violate French competition law, and issued a fine of €1.1 billion. The Company strongly disagrees with the FCA’s decision, and has appealed.Apple Inc. | 2020 Form 10-K | 54

On August 11, 2020, a jury returned a verdict against the Company and awarded damages of $506 million. The Company has asked the court to set aside the verdict, where the case remains pending.Note 11 – Segment Information and Geographic DataThe Company reports segment information based on the “management” approach. The management approach designates the internal reporting used by management for making decisions and assessing performance as the source of the Company’s reportable segments.The Company manages its business primarily on a geographic basis. The Company’s reportable segments consist of the Americas, Europe, Greater China, Japan and Rest of Asia Pacific. Americas includes both North and South America. Europe includes European countries, as well as India, the Middle East and Africa. Greater China includes China mainland, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Rest of Asia Pacific includes Australia and those Asian countries not included in the Company’s other reportable segments. Although the reportable segments provide similar hardware and software products and similar services, each one is managed separately to better align with the location of the Company’s customers and distribution partners and the unique market dynamics of each geographic region. The accounting policies of the various segments are the same as those described in Note 1, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.”The Company evaluates the performance of its reportable segments based on net sales and operating income. Net sales for geographic segments are generally based on the location of customers and sales through the Company’s retail stores located in those geographic locations. Operating income for each segment includes net sales to third parties, related cost of sales and operating expenses directly attributable to the segment. Advertising expenses are generally included in the geographic segment in which the expenditures are incurred. Operating income for each segment excludes other income and expense and certain expenses managed outside the reportable segments. Costs excluded from segment operating income include various corporate expenses such as research and development, corporate marketing expenses, certain share-based compensation expenses, income taxes, various nonrecurring charges and other separately managed general and administrative costs. The Company does not include intercompany transfers between segments for management reporting purposes.The following table shows information by reportable segment for 2020, 2019 and 2018 (in millions):Apple Inc. | 2020 Form 10-K | 55

A reconciliation of the Company’s segment operating income to the Consolidated Statements of Operations for 2020, 2019 and 2018 is as follows (in millions):The U.S. and China were the only countries that accounted for more than 10% of the Company’s net sales in 2020, 2019 and 2018. There was no single customer that accounted for more than 10% of net sales in 2020, 2019 and 2018. Net sales for 2020, 2019 and 2018 and long-lived assets as of September 26, 2020 and September 28, 2019 were as follows (in millions):(1)China includes Hong Kong and Taiwan. Long-lived assets located in China consist primarily of product tooling and manufacturing process equipment and assets related to retail stores and related infrastructure.Note 12 – LeasesThe Company has lease arrangements for certain equipment and facilities, including retail, corporate, manufacturing and data center space. These leases typically have original terms not exceeding 10 years and generally contain multi-year renewal options, some of which are reasonably certain of exercise. The Company’s lease arrangements may contain both lease and non-lease components. The Company has elected to combine and account for lease and non-lease components as a single lease component for leases of retail, corporate, and data center facilities.Payments under the Company’s lease arrangements may be fixed or variable, and variable lease payments are primarily based on purchases of output of the underlying leased assets. Lease costs associated with fixed payments on the Company’s operating leases were $1.5 billion for 2020. Lease costs associated with variable payments on the Company’s leases were $9.3 billion for 2020. Rent expense for operating leases, as previously reported under former lease accounting standards, was $1.3 billion and $1.2 billion in 2019 and 2018, respectively.For 2020, the Company made $1.5 billion of fixed cash payments related to operating leases. Non-cash activities involving ROU assets obtained in exchange for lease liabilities were $10.5 billion for 2020, including the impact of adopting the new leases standard in the first quarter of 2020.Apple Inc. | 2020 Form 10-K | 56

The following table shows ROU assets and lease liabilities, and the associated financial statement line items, as of September 26, 2020 (in millions):Lease liability maturities as of September 26, 2020, are as follows (in millions):The weighted-average remaining lease term and discount rate related to the Company’s lease liabilities as of September 26, 2020 were 10.3 years and 2.0%, respectively. The discount rates are generally based on estimates of the Company’s incremental borrowing rate, as the discount rates implicit in the Company’s leases cannot be readily determined.As of September 26, 2020, the Company had $1.7 billion of future payments under additional leases, primarily for corporate facilities and retail space, that had not yet commenced. These leases will commence between 2021 and 2022, with lease terms ranging from 1 year to 20 years.Note 13 – Selected Quarterly Financial Information (Unaudited)The following tables show a summary of the Company’s quarterly financial information for each of the four quarters of 2020 and 2019 (in millions, except per share amounts):Apple Inc. | 2020 Form 10-K | 57

A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate./s/ Ernst & Young LLPSan Jose, CaliforniaOctober 29, 2020Apple Inc. | 2020 Form 10-K | 61

## Item 1A


development and/or manufacture products resulting in product delays; inability of customers, including channel partners, to obtain credit to finance purchases of the companys
products; and failure of derivative counterparties and other financial institutions. other income and expense also could vary materially from expectations depending on gains or losses realized on the sale or exchange of financial
instruments; impairment charges resulting from revaluations of debt and equity securities and other investments; interest rates; cash balances; and changes in fair value of derivative instruments. increased volatility in the financial
markets and overall economic uncertainty would increase the risk of the actual amounts realized in the future on the companys financial instruments differing significantly from the fair values currently assigned to them.global markets for the companys products and services are highly competitive and subject to rapid technological
change, and the company may be unable to compete effectively in these markets.the companys products and services
compete in highly competitive global markets characterized by aggressive price cutting and resulting downward pressure on gross margins, frequent introduction of new products, short product life cycles, evolving industry standards, continual
improvement in product price/performance characteristics, rapid adoption of technological and product advancements by competitors, and price sensitivity on the part of consumers.the companys ability to compete successfully depends heavily on its ability to ensure a continuing and timely introduction of
innovative new products and technologies to the marketplace. the company believes it is unique in that it designs and develops nearly the entire solution for its products, including the hardware, operating system, numerous software applications, and
related services. as a result, the company must make significant investments in research and development and currently holds a significant number of patents and copyrights and has registered and/or has applied to register numerous patents,
trademarks and service marks. in contrast, many of the companys competitors seek to compete primarily through aggressive pricing and very low cost structures, and emulating the companys products and
infringing its intellectual property. if the company is unable to continue to develop and sell innovative new products with attractive margins or if competitors infringe on the companys intellectual property, the companys
ability to maintain a competitive advantage could be adversely affected.the company markets certain mobile communication and
media devices based on the ios mobile operating system and also markets related third-party digital content and applications. the company faces substantial competition in these markets from companies that have significant technical, marketing,
distribution and other resources, as well as established hardware, software and digital content supplier relationships. additionally, the company faces significant price competition as competitors reduce their selling prices and attempt to imitate
the companys product features and applications within their own products or, alternatively, collaborate with each other to offer solutions that are more competitive than those they currently offer. the company also competes with illegitimate
ways to obtain third-party digital content and applications. the company has entered the mobile communications and media device markets, and some of its competitors in these markets have greater experience, product breadth and distribution channels
than the company. because some current and potential competitors have substantial resources and/or experience and a lower cost structure, they may be able to provide such products and services at little or no profit or even at a loss. the company
also expects competition to intensify as competitors attempt to imitate the companys approach to providing these components seamlessly within their individual offerings or work collaboratively to offer integrated solutions. the companys
financial condition and operating results depend substantially on the companys ability to continually improve ios and ios devices in order to maintain their functional and design advantages.the company is the only authorized maker of hardware using os x, which has a minority market share in the personal computer market. this
market is dominated by computer makers using competing operating systems, most notably windows. in the market for personal computers and peripherals, the company faces a significant number of competitors, many of which have broader product lines,
lower priced products, and a larger installed customer base. historically, consolidation in this market has resulted in larger competitors. price competition has10



been particularly intense as competitors selling windows-based personal computers have aggressively cut prices and lowered product margins. an increasing number of internet-enabled devices that
include software applications and are smaller and simpler than traditional personal computers compete for market share with the companys existing products. the companys financial condition and operating results depend substantially on
its ability to continually improve the mac platform to maintain its functional and design advantages.there can be no
assurance the company will be able to continue to provide products and services that compete effectively.to remain
competitive and stimulate customer demand, the company must successfully manage frequent product introductions and transitions.due to the highly volatile and competitive nature of the industries in which the company competes, the company must continually introduce new products, services and technologies, enhance existing products
and services, and effectively stimulate customer demand for new and upgraded products. the success of new product introductions depends on a number of factors including, but not limited to, timely and successful product development, market
acceptance, the companys ability to manage the risks associated with new product production ramp-up issues, the availability of application software for new products, the effective management of purchase commitments and inventory levels in
line with anticipated product demand, the availability of products in appropriate quantities and costs to meet anticipated demand, and the risk that new products may have quality or other defects in the early stages of introduction. accordingly, the
company cannot determine in advance the ultimate effect of new product introductions and transitions.the company faces
substantial inventory and other asset risk in addition to purchase commitment cancellation risk.the company records a
write-down for product and component inventories that have become obsolete or exceed anticipated demand or net realizable value and accrues necessary cancellation fee reserves for orders of excess products and components. the company also reviews
its long-lived assets, including capital assets held at its suppliers facilities, for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. if the company determines that impairment has
occurred, it records a write-down equal to the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds its fair market value. although the company believes its provisions related to inventory, capital assets, other assets and purchase commitments
are currently adequate, no assurance can be given that the company will not incur additional related charges given the rapid and unpredictable pace of product obsolescence in the industries in which the company competes.the company must order components for its products and build inventory in advance of product announcements and shipments. consistent with
industry practice, components are normally acquired through a combination of purchase orders, supplier contracts, open orders and, where appropriate, inventory component prepayments, in each case based on projected demand. such purchase commitments
typically cover forecasted component and manufacturing requirements for periods up to 150 days. because the companys markets are volatile, competitive and subject to rapid technology and price changes, there is a risk the company will forecast
incorrectly and order or produce excess or insufficient amounts of components or products, or not fully utilize firm purchase commitments.future operating results depend upon the companys ability to obtain components in sufficient quantities.because the company currently obtains components from single or limited sources, the company is subject to significant supply and pricing
risks. many components, including those that are available from multiple sources, are at times subject to industry-wide shortages and significant commodity pricing fluctuations. while the company has entered into various agreements for the supply of
components, there can be no assurance that the company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms, or at all. the follow-on effects from11



global economic conditions on the companys suppliers, described in global economic conditions could materially adversely affect the company above, also could affect
the companys ability to obtain components. therefore, the company remains subject to significant risks of supply shortages and price increases. the company expects to experience decreases in its gross margin percentage in future
periods, as compared to levels achieved during 2012, largely due to a higher mix of new and innovative products with flat or reduced pricing that have higher cost structures and deliver greater value to customers and anticipated component cost and
other cost increases. future strengthening of the u.s. dollar could also negatively impact gross margin.the company and
other participants in the markets for mobile communication and media devices and personal computers also compete for various components with other industries that have experienced increased demand for their products. the company uses some custom
components that are not common to the rest of these industries. the companys new products often utilize custom components available from only one source. when a component or product uses new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist
until the suppliers yields have matured or manufacturing capacity has increased. continued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at all, may be affected if those suppliers decided to concentrate on the production of common
components instead of components customized to meet the companys requirements. the supply of components for a new or existing product could be delayed or constrained, or a key manufacturing vendor could delay shipments of completed products to
the company.the company depends on component and product manufacturing and logistical services provided by outsourcing partners, many of
whom are located outside of the u.s.substantially all of the companys manufacturing is performed in whole or in
part by a few outsourcing partners located primarily in asia. the company has also outsourced much of its transportation and logistics management. while these arrangements may lower operating costs, they also reduce the companys direct control
over production and distribution. it is uncertain what effect such diminished control will have on the quality or quantity of products or services, or the companys flexibility to respond to changing conditions. although arrangements with these
partners may contain provisions for warranty expense reimbursement, the company may remain responsible to the consumer for warranty service in the event of product defects and could experience an unanticipated product defect or warranty liability.
while the company relies on its partners to adhere to its supplier code of conduct, material violations of the supplier code of conduct could occur.the supply and manufacture of many critical components is performed by sole-sourced outsourcing partners in the u.s., asia and europe. outsourcing partners in asia perform final assembly of substantially
all of the companys hardware products. manufacturing or logistics in these locations or transit to final destinations may be disrupted for a variety of reasons including, but not limited to, natural and man-made disasters, information
technology system failures, military actions or economic, business, labor, environmental, public health, or political issues.the company relies on third-party intellectual property and digital content, which may not be available to the company on commercially
reasonable terms or at all.many of the companys products include third-party intellectual property, which requires
licenses from those third parties. based on past experience and industry practice, the company believes such licenses generally can be obtained on reasonable terms. there is, however, no assurance that the necessary licenses can be obtained on
acceptable terms or at all.the company also contracts with third parties to offer their digital content through the itunes
store. the licensing arrangements with these third parties are short-term and do not guarantee the continuation or renewal of these arrangements on reasonable terms, if at all. some third-party content providers and distributors currently or in the
future may offer competing products and services, and could take action to make it more difficult or impossible for the company to license their content in the future. other content owners, providers or distributors12



may seek to limit the companys access to, or increase the cost of, such content. the company may be unable to continue to offer a wide variety of content at reasonable prices with
acceptable usage rules, or continue to expand its geographic reach.many third-party content providers require the company to
provide digital rights management and other security solutions. if requirements change, the company may have to develop or license new technology to provide these solutions. there is no assurance the company will be able to develop or license such
solutions at a reasonable cost and in a timely manner. in addition, certain countries have passed or may propose and adopt legislation that would force the company to license its digital rights management, which could lessen the protection of
content and subject it to piracy and also could negatively affect arrangements with the companys content providers.the company is frequently involved in intellectual property litigation, and could be found to have infringed on intellectual property
rights.technology companies, including many of the companys competitors, frequently enter into litigation based on
allegations of patent infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. in addition, patent holding companies seek to monetize patents they have purchased or otherwise obtained. as the company has grown, the intellectual property
rights claims against it have increased and may continue to increase. in particular, the companys cellular enabled products compete with mobile communication and media device companies that hold significant patent portfolios, and the number of
patent claims against the company has significantly increased. the company is vigorously defending infringement actions in courts in a number of u.s. jurisdictions and before the u.s. international trade commission, as well as internationally
in europe and asia. the plaintiffs in these actions frequently seek injunctions and substantial damages.regardless of the
scope or validity of such patents or other intellectual property rights, or the merits of any claims by potential or actual litigants, the company may have to engage in protracted litigation. such litigation is often expensive, time-consuming,
disruptive to the companys operations, and distracting to management. if the company is found to infringe one or more patents or other intellectual property rights, regardless of whether it can develop non-infringing technology, it may be
required to pay substantial damages or royalties to a third-party, or it may be subject to a temporary or permanent injunction prohibiting the company from marketing or selling certain products.in certain cases, the company may consider the desirability of entering into licensing agreements, although no assurance can be given
that such licenses can be obtained on acceptable terms or that litigation will not occur. these licenses may also significantly increase the companys operating expenses.in managements opinion, there is not at least a reasonable possibility the company may have incurred a material loss, or a material loss in excess of a recorded accrual, with respect to loss
contingencies, including matters related to infringement of intellectual property rights. however, the outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain. therefore, although management considers the likelihood of such an outcome to be remote, if one or
more of these legal matters were resolved against the company in a reporting period for amounts in excess of managements expectations, the companys consolidated financial statements for that reporting period could be materially adversely
affected.the companys future performance depends in part on support from third-party software developers.the company believes decisions by customers to purchase its hardware products depend in part on the availability of third-party software
applications and services. there is no assurance that third-party developers will continue to develop and maintain software applications and services for the companys products. if third-party software applications and services cease to be
developed and maintained for the companys products, customers may choose not to buy the companys products.13



with respect to its mac products, the company believes the availability of third-party
software applications and services depends in part on the developers perception and analysis of the relative benefits of developing, maintaining, and upgrading such software for the companys products compared to windows-based products.
this analysis may be based on factors such as the market position of the company and its products, the anticipated revenue that may be generated, continued growth of mac sales, and the costs of developing such applications and services. if the
companys minority share of the global personal computer market causes developers to question the companys prospects, developers could be less inclined to develop or upgrade software for the companys products and more inclined to
devote their resources to developing and upgrading software for the larger windows market.with respect to ios devices, the
company relies on the continued availability and development of compelling and innovative software applications, which are distributed through a single distribution channel, the app store. the absence of multiple distribution channels, which are
available for competing platforms, may limit the availability and acceptance of third-party applications by the companys customers, thereby causing developers to reduce or curtail development for the ios platform. in addition, ios devices are
subject to rapid technological change, and, if third-party developers are unable to or choose not to keep up with this pace of change, third-party applications might not successfully operate and may result in dissatisfied customers. as with
applications for the companys mac products, the availability and development of these applications also depend on developers perceptions and analysis of the relative benefits of developing software for the companys products rather
than its competitors platforms, such as android. if developers focus their efforts on these competing platforms, the availability and quality of applications for the companys ios devices may suffer.the company depends on the performance of distributors, carriers and other resellers.the company distributes its products through cellular network carriers, wholesalers, national and regional retailers, and value-added
resellers, many of whom distribute products from competing manufacturers. the company also sells its products and third-party products in most of its major markets directly to education, enterprise and government customers, and consumers and small
and mid-sized businesses through its online and retail stores.carriers providing cellular network service for iphone
typically subsidize users purchase of the device. there is no assurance that such subsidies will be continued at all or in the same amounts upon renewal of the companys agreements with these carriers or in agreements the company enters
into with new carriers.many resellers have narrow operating margins and have been adversely affected in the past by weak
economic conditions. some resellers have perceived the expansion of the companys direct sales as conflicting with their business interests as distributors and resellers of the companys products. such a perception could discourage
resellers from investing resources in the distribution and sale of the companys products or lead them to limit or cease distribution of those products. the company has invested and will continue to invest in programs to enhance reseller sales,
including staffing selected resellers stores with company employees and contractors and improving product placement displays. these programs could require a substantial investment while providing no assurance of return or incremental revenue.
the financial condition of these resellers could weaken, these resellers could stop distributing the companys products, or uncertainty regarding demand for the companys products could cause resellers to reduce their ordering and
marketing of the companys products.the companys retail segment has required and will continue to require a
substantial investment and commitment of resources and is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties.the companys
retail stores have required substantial fixed investment in equipment and leasehold improvements, information systems, inventory and personnel. the company also has entered into substantial operating lease commitments for retail space. certain
stores have been designed and built to serve as high-profile venues to promote brand awareness and serve as vehicles for corporate sales and marketing activities. because of their unique design elements, locations and size, these stores require
substantially more investment than the14



companys more typical retail stores. due to the high fixed cost structure associated with the retail segment, a decline in sales or the closure or poor performance of individual or multiple
stores could result in significant lease termination costs, write-offs of equipment and leasehold improvements, and severance costs.many factors unique to retail operations, some of which are beyond the companys control, pose risks and uncertainties. these risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, macro-economic
factors that could have an adverse effect on general retail activity, as well as the companys inability to manage costs associated with store construction and operation, failure to manage relationships with its existing retail channel
partners, more challenging environments in managing retail operations outside the u.s., costs associated with unanticipated fluctuations in the value of retail inventory, and inability to obtain and renew leases in quality retail locations at a
reasonable cost.investment in new business strategies and acquisitions could disrupt the companys ongoing business
and present risks not originally contemplated.the company has invested, and in the future may invest, in new business
strategies or acquisitions. such endeavors may involve significant risks and uncertainties, including distraction of management from current operations, greater than expected liabilities and expenses, inadequate return of capital, and unidentified
issues not discovered in the companys due diligence. these new ventures are inherently risky and may not be successful.the companys products and services may experience quality problems from time to time that can result in decreased sales and
operating margin.the company sells complex hardware and software products and services that can contain design and
manufacturing defects. sophisticated operating system software and applications, such as those sold by the company, often contain bugs that can unexpectedly interfere with the softwares intended operation. the companys online
services may from time to time experience outages, service slowdowns, or errors. defects may also occur in components and products the company purchases from third parties. there can be no assurance the company will be able to detect and fix all
defects in the hardware, software and services it sells. failure to do so could result in lost revenue, significant warranty and other expenses, and harm to the companys reputation.the company is subject to laws and regulations worldwide, changes to which could increase the companys costs and individually or
in the aggregate adversely affect the companys business.the company is subject to laws and regulations affecting
its domestic and international operations in a number of areas. these u.s. and foreign laws and regulations affect the companys activities including, but not limited to, areas of labor, advertising, digital content, consumer protection,
real estate, billing, e-commerce, promotions, quality of services, telecommunications, mobile communications and media, television, intellectual property ownership and infringement, tax, import and export requirements, anti-corruption, foreign
exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions, data privacy requirements, anti-competition, environmental, health, and safety.by way of example, laws and regulations related to mobile communications and media devices in the many jurisdictions in which the company operates are extensive and subject to change. such changes could
include, among others, restrictions on the production, manufacture, distribution, and use of the device, locking the device to a carriers network, or mandating the use of the device on more than one carriers network. these devices are
also subject to certification and regulation by governmental and standardization bodies, as well as by cellular network carriers for use on their networks. these certification processes are extensive and time consuming, and could result in
additional testing requirements, product modifications, delays in product shipment dates, or preclude the company from selling certain products.compliance with these laws, regulations and similar requirements may be onerous and expensive, and they may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, further increasing the cost of
compliance. this increases the costs of doing business, and any such costs, which may rise in the future as a result of changes in these laws and15



regulations or in their interpretation could individually or in the aggregate make the companys products and services less attractive to the companys customers, delay the introduction
of new products in one or more regions, or cause the company to change or limit its business practices. the company has implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these laws and regulations, but there can be no assurance
that the companys employees, contractors, or agents will not violate such laws and regulations or the companys policies.the
companys success depends largely on the continued service and availability of key personnel.much of the
companys future success depends on the continued availability and service of key personnel, including its chief executive officer, executive team and other highly skilled employees. experienced personnel in the technology industry are in high
demand and competition for their talents is intense, especially in the silicon valley, where most of the companys key personnel are located.the companys business may be impacted by political events, war, terrorism, public health issues, natural disasters and other circumstances.war, terrorism, geopolitical uncertainties, public health issues, and other business interruptions have caused and could cause damage or
disruption to international commerce and the global economy, and thus could have a material adverse effect on the company, its suppliers, logistics providers, manufacturing vendors and customers, including channel partners. the companys
business operations are subject to interruption by natural disasters, fire, power shortages, nuclear power plant accidents, terrorist attacks, and other hostile acts, labor disputes, public health issues, and other events beyond its control. such
events could decrease demand for the companys products, make it difficult or impossible for the company to make and deliver products to its customers, including channel partners, or to receive components from its suppliers, and create delays
and inefficiencies in the companys supply chain. should major public health issues, including pandemics, arise, the company could be adversely affected by more stringent employee travel restrictions, additional limitations in freight services,
governmental actions limiting the movement of products between regions, delays in production ramps of new products, and disruptions in the operations of the companys manufacturing vendors and component suppliers. the majority of the
companys research and development activities, its corporate headquarters, information technology systems, and other critical business operations, including certain component suppliers and manufacturing vendors, are in locations that could be
affected by natural disasters. in the event of a natural disaster, the company could incur significant losses, require substantial recovery time and experience significant expenditures in order to resume operations.the companys business and reputation may be impacted by information technology system failures or network disruptions.the company may be subject to information technology system failures and network disruptions. these may be caused by
natural disasters, accidents, power disruptions, telecommunications failures, acts of terrorism or war, computer viruses, physical or electronic break-ins, or similar events or disruptions. system redundancy may be ineffective or inadequate, and the
companys disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities. such failures or disruptions could prevent access to the companys online stores and services, preclude retail store transactions, compromise company or
customer data, and result in delayed or cancelled orders. system failures and disruptions could also impede the manufacturing and shipping of products, delivery of online services, transactions processing and financial reporting.the company may be subject to breaches of its information technology systems, which could damage business partner and customer
relationships, curtail or otherwise adversely impact access to online stores and services, and could subject the company to significant reputational, financial, legal, and operational consequences.the companys business requires it to use and store customer, employee, and business partner personally identifiable information
(pii). this may include names, addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, contact16



preferences, tax identification numbers, and payment account information. although malicious attacks to gain access to pii affect many companies across various industries, the company may be at a
relatively greater risk of being targeted because of its high profile and the amount of pii managed.the company requires
user names and passwords in order to access its information technology systems. the company also uses encryption and authentication technologies to secure the transmission and storage of data. these security measures may be compromised as a result
of third-party security breaches, employee error, malfeasance, faulty password management, or other irregularity, and result in persons obtaining unauthorized access to company data or accounts. third parties may attempt to fraudulently induce
employees or customers into disclosing user names, passwords or other sensitive information, which may in turn be used to access the companys information technology systems. to help protect customers and the company, the company monitors
accounts and systems for unusual activity and may freeze accounts under suspicious circumstances, which may result in the delay or loss of customer orders.the company devotes significant resources to network security, data encryption, and other security measures to protect its systems and data, but these security measures cannot provide absolute security.
the company may experience a breach of its systems and may be unable to protect sensitive data. moreover, if a computer security breach affects the companys systems or results in the unauthorized release of pii, the companys reputation
and brand could be materially damaged and use of the companys products and services could decrease. the company would also be exposed to a risk of loss or litigation and possible liability.the companys business is subject to a variety of u.s. and international laws, rules, policies and other obligations regarding
data protection.the company is subject to federal, state and international laws relating to the collection, use,
retention, security and transfer of pii. in many cases, these laws apply not only to third-party transactions, but also to transfers of information between the company and its subsidiaries, and among the company, its subsidiaries and other parties
with which the company has commercial relations. several jurisdictions have passed new laws in this area, and other jurisdictions are considering imposing additional restrictions. these laws continue to develop and may be inconsistent from
jurisdiction to jurisdiction. complying with emerging and changing international requirements may cause the company to incur substantial costs or require the company to change its business practices. noncompliance could result in penalties or
significant legal liability.the companys privacy policy and related practices concerning the use and disclosure of
data are posted on its website. any failure by the company, its suppliers or other parties with whom the company does business to comply with its posted privacy policy or with other federal, state or international privacy-related or data protection
laws and regulations could result in proceedings against the company by governmental entities or others.the company is also
subject to payment card association rules and obligations under its contracts with payment card processors. under these rules and obligations, if information is compromised, the company could be liable to payment card issuers for the cost of
associated expenses and penalties. in addition, if the company fails to follow payment card industry security standards, even if no customer information is compromised, the company could incur significant fines or experience a significant increase
in payment card transaction costs.the company expects its quarterly revenue and operating results to fluctuate.the companys profit margins vary among its products and its distribution channels. the companys software,
accessories, and service and support contracts generally have higher gross margins than certain of the companys other products. gross margins on the companys hardware products vary across product lines and can change over time as a
result of product transitions, pricing and configuration changes, and component, warranty, and other cost fluctuations. the companys direct sales generally have higher associated gross margins than its17



indirect sales through its channel partners. in addition, the companys gross margin and operating margin percentages, as well as overall profitability, may be materially adversely impacted
as a result of a shift in product, geographic or channel mix, new products, component cost increases, strengthening u.s. dollar, or price competition. the company has typically experienced higher net sales in the first fiscal quarter compared to
other fiscal quarters due in part to holiday seasonal demand. actual and anticipated timing of new product introductions by the company can also significantly impact the level of net sales experienced by the company in any particular quarter. the
company could be subject to unexpected developments late in a quarter, such as lower-than-anticipated demand for the companys products, issues with new product introductions, an internal systems failure, or failure of one of the companys
logistics, components supply, or manufacturing partners.the companys stock price is subject to volatility.the companys stock continues to experience substantial price volatility. additionally, the company, the technology
industry, and the stock market as a whole have experienced extreme stock price and volume fluctuations that have affected stock prices in ways that may have been unrelated to these companies operating performance. the company believes its
stock price reflects high future growth and profitability expectations. if the company fails to meet these expectations its stock price may significantly decline, which could have a material adverse impact on investor confidence and employee
retention.the companys business is subject to the risks of international operations.the company derives a significant portion of its revenue and earnings from its international operations. compliance with applicable u.s.
and foreign laws and regulations, such as import and export requirements, anti-corruption laws, tax laws, foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions, data privacy requirements, environmental laws, labor laws, and anti-competition
regulations, increases the costs of doing business in foreign jurisdictions. although the company has implemented policies and procedures to comply with these laws and regulations, a violation by the companys employees, contractors, or agents
could nevertheless occur.the company also could be significantly affected by other risks associated with international
activities including, but not limited to, economic and labor conditions, increased duties, taxes and other costs, political instability, and changes in the value of the u.s. dollar versus local currencies. margins on sales of the companys
products in foreign countries, and on sales of products that include components obtained from foreign suppliers, could be materially adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and by international trade regulations, including
duties, tariffs and antidumping penalties. the company is also exposed to credit and collectability risk on its trade receivables with customers in certain international markets. there can be no assurance the company can effectively limit its credit
risk and avoid losses.the companys primary exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates relates to
non-u.s. dollar denominated sales and operating expenses worldwide. for example, the uncertainty regarding the ability of certain european countries to continue to service their sovereign debt obligations and the related financial restructuring
efforts by european governments may cause the value of several european currencies, including the euro, to fluctuate, which could adversely affect the companys non-u.s. dollar sales and operating expenses in the impacted jurisdictions.
weakening of foreign currencies relative to the u.s. dollar adversely affects the u.s. dollar value of the companys foreign currency-denominated sales and earnings, and generally leads the company to raise international pricing, potentially
reducing demand for the companys products. in some circumstances, for competitive or other reasons, the company may decide not to raise local prices to fully offset the dollars strengthening, or at all, which would adversely affect the
u.s. dollar value of the companys foreign currency denominated sales and earnings. conversely, a strengthening of foreign currencies relative to the u.s. dollar, while generally beneficial to the companys foreign currency-denominated
sales and earnings, could cause the company to reduce international pricing and incur losses on its foreign currency derivative instruments, thereby limiting the benefit. additionally, strengthening of foreign currencies may also increase the
companys cost of product components denominated in those currencies, thus adversely affecting gross margins.18



the company uses derivative instruments, such as foreign currency forward and option
contracts, to hedge certain exposures to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. the use of such hedging activities may not offset any or more than a portion of the adverse financial effects of unfavorable movements in foreign exchange
rates over the limited time the hedges are in place.the company is exposed to credit risk and fluctuations in the market
values of its investment portfolio.the company has not recognized any significant losses on its cash, cash equivalents
and marketable securities, but could experience significant declines in the market value of its investment portfolio. given the global nature of its business, the company has both domestic and international investments. credit ratings and pricing of
these investments can be negatively affected by liquidity, credit deterioration, financial results, economic risk, political risk, sovereign risk or other factors. as a result, the value and liquidity of the companys cash, cash equivalents and
marketable securities could decline and result in a significant impairment.the company is exposed to credit risk on its
trade accounts receivable, vendor non-trade receivables and prepayments related to long-term supply agreements, and this risk is heightened during periods when economic conditions worsen.the company distributes its products through third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers and value-added resellers. a
substantial majority of the companys outstanding trade receivables are not covered by collateral or credit insurance. the companys exposure to credit and collectability risk on its trade receivables is higher in certain international
markets and its ability to mitigate such risks may be limited. the company also has unsecured vendor non-trade receivables resulting from purchases of components by outsourcing partners and other vendors that manufacture sub-assemblies or assemble
final products for the company. in addition, the company has made prepayments associated with long-term supply agreements to secure supply of inventory components. as of september 29, 2012, a significant portion of the companys trade
receivables were concentrated within cellular network carriers, and its non-trade receivables and long-term supply agreements were concentrated among a few individual vendors located primarily in asia. while the company has procedures to monitor and
limit exposure to credit risk on its trade and vendor non-trade receivables as well as long-term prepayments, there can be no assurance such procedures will effectively limit its credit risk and avoid losses.the company could be impacted by unfavorable results of legal proceedings.the company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that have not yet been fully resolved and that have arisen in the ordinary
course of business, and additional claims may arise in the future. results of legal proceedings are subject to significant uncertainty and, regardless of the merit of the claims, litigation may be expensive, time-consuming, disruptive to the
companys operations, and distracting to management. in recognition of these considerations, the company may enter into arrangements to settle litigation.although management considers the likelihood of such an outcome to be remote, if one or more of these legal matters were resolved against the company in a reporting period for amounts in excess of
managements expectations, the companys consolidated financial statements for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected. further, such an outcome could result in significant compensatory, punitive or trebled monetary
damages, disgorgement of revenue or profits, remedial corporate measures or injunctive relief against the company that could materially adversely affect its financial condition and operating results.the company could be subject to changes in its tax rates, the adoption of new u.s. or international tax legislation or exposure to
additional tax liabilities.the company is subject to taxes in the u.s. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. current
economic and political conditions make tax rates in any jurisdiction, including the u.s., subject to significant change. the companys future effective tax rates could be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing

the markets where it competes, these markets are highly competitive and subject to aggressive pricing. to remain competitive, the company believes that continual investment in research and
development and marketing and advertising is critical to the development and sale of innovative products and technologies. the companys research and development spending is focused on investing in new hardware and software products, and in
further developing its existing products, including iphone, ipad, mac, and ipod hardware; ios and os x operating systems; and a variety of application software and online services.the company uses a variety of direct and indirect distribution channels, such as its retail stores, online stores, and direct sales
force, and third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers, and value-added resellers. the company believes that sales of its innovative and differentiated products are enhanced by knowledgeable salespersons who can convey the value of
the hardware and software integration, and demonstrate the unique solutions that are available on its products. the company further believes providing direct contact with its targeted customers is an effective way to demonstrate the advantages of
its products over those of its competitors and providing a high-quality sales and after-sales support experience is critical to attracting new and retaining existing customers. to ensure a high-quality buying experience for its products in which
service and education are emphasized, the company continues to expand and improve its distribution capabilities by expanding the number of its own retail stores worldwide. additionally, the company has invested in programs to enhance reseller sales
by placing high quality apple fixtures, merchandising materials and other resources within selected third-party reseller locations. through the apple premium reseller program, certain third-party resellers focus on the apple platform by providing a
high level of integration and support services, and product expertise.critical accounting policies and estimatesthe preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles
(gaap) and the companys discussion and analysis of its financial condition and operating results require the companys management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported in its
consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. note 1, summary of significant accounting policies of the notes to consolidated financial statements in part ii, item 8 of this form 10-k describes the significant accounting
policies and methods used in the preparation of the companys consolidated financial statements. management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the
results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. actual results may differ from these estimates and such differences may be material.management believes the companys critical accounting policies and estimates are those related to revenue recognition, valuation and
impairment of marketable securities, inventory valuation and inventory purchase commitments, warranty costs, income taxes, and legal and other contingencies. management considers these policies critical because they are both important to the
portrayal of the companys financial condition and operating results, and they require management to make judgments and estimates about inherently uncertain matters. the companys senior management has reviewed these critical accounting
policies and related disclosures with the audit and finance committee of the companys board of directors.revenue recognitionnet sales consist primarily of revenue from the sale of hardware, software, digital content and applications, peripherals,
and service and support contracts. the company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the sales price is fixed or determinable, and collection is probable. product is considered delivered to the
customer once it has been shipped and title and risk of loss have been transferred. for most of the companys product sales, these criteria are met at the time the product is shipped. for online sales to individuals, for some sales to education
customers in the u.s., and for certain other sales, the company defers revenue until the customer receives the product because the company retains a portion of the risk of loss on these sales during transit. the company recognizes revenue from the
sale of hardware products,26



software bundled with hardware that is essential to the functionality of the hardware, and third-party digital content sold on the itunes store in accordance with general revenue recognition
accounting guidance. the company recognizes revenue in accordance with industry specific software accounting guidance for the following types of sales transactions: (i) standalone sales of software products, (ii) sales of software upgrades
and (iii) sales of software bundled with hardware not essential to the functionality of the hardware.for multi-element
arrangements that include hardware products containing software essential to the hardware products functionality, undelivered software elements that relate to the hardware products essential software, and/or undelivered non-software
services, the company allocates revenue to all deliverables based on their relative selling prices. in such circumstances, the company uses a hierarchy to determine the selling price to be used for allocating revenue to deliverables:
(i) vendor-specific objective evidence of fair value (vsoe), (ii) third-party evidence of selling price (tpe) and (iii) best estimate of selling price (esp). vsoe generally exists only when the
company sells the deliverable separately and is the price actually charged by the company for that deliverable. esps reflect the companys best estimates of what the selling prices of elements would be if they were sold regularly on a
stand-alone basis.for sales of qualifying versions of ios devices, mac and apple tv, the company has indicated it may from
time to time provide future unspecified software upgrades and features free of charge to customers. the company also provides various non-software services to owners of qualifying versions of ios devices and mac. because the company has neither vsoe
nor tpe for the unspecified software upgrade rights or the non-software services, revenue is allocated to these rights and services based on the companys esps. revenue allocated to the unspecified software upgrade rights and non-software
services based on the companys esps is deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis over the estimated period the software upgrades and non-software services are expected to be provided for each of these devices, which ranges from two to
four years.the companys process for determining esps involves managements judgment and considers multiple
factors that may vary over time depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each deliverable. if the facts and circumstances underlying the factors considered change, including the estimated or actual costs incurred to provide
non-software services or the estimated period the software upgrades and non-software services are expected to be provided, or should future facts and circumstances lead the company to consider additional factors, the companys esps and the
future rate of related amortization for software upgrades and non-software services related to future sales of these devices could change.the company records reductions to revenue for estimated commitments related to price protection and other customer incentive programs. for transactions involving price protection, the company recognizes
revenue net of the estimated amount to be refunded, provided the refund amount can be reasonably and reliably estimated and the other conditions for revenue recognition have been met. the companys policy requires that, if refunds cannot be
reliably estimated, revenue is not recognized until reliable estimates can be made or the price protection lapses. for the companys other customer incentive programs, the estimated cost is recognized at the later of the date at which the
company has sold the product or the date at which the program is offered. the company also records reductions to revenue for expected future product returns based on the companys historical experience. future market conditions and product
transitions may require the company to increase customer incentive programs that could result in reductions to future revenue. additionally, certain customer incentive programs require management to estimate the number of customers who will actually
redeem the incentive. managements estimates are based on historical experience and the specific terms and conditions of particular incentive programs. if a greater than estimated proportion of customers redeems such incentives, the company
would be required to record additional reductions to revenue, which would have an adverse impact on the companys results of operations.valuation and impairment of marketable securitiesthe companys investments in available-for-sale securities are reported at fair value. unrealized gains and losses related to changes in the fair value of securities are recognized in accumulated
other comprehensive income, net27



of tax, in the companys consolidated balance sheets. changes in the fair value of available-for-sale securities impact the companys net income only when such securities are sold or an
other-than-temporary impairment is recognized. realized gains and losses on the sale of securities are determined by specific identification of each securitys cost basis. the company regularly reviews its investment portfolio to determine if
any security is other-than-temporarily impaired, which would require the company to record an impairment charge in the period any such determination is made. in making this judgment, the company evaluates, among other things, the duration and extent
to which the fair value of a security is less than its cost; the financial condition of the issuer and any changes thereto; and the companys intent to sell, or whether it will more likely than not be required to sell, the security before
recovery of the its amortized cost basis. the companys assessment on whether a security is other-than-temporarily impaired could change in the future due to new developments or changes in assumptions related to any particular security.inventory valuation and inventory purchase commitmentsthe company must order components for its products and build inventory in advance of product shipments. the company records a write-down for inventories of components and products, including third-party
products held for resale, which have become obsolete or are in excess of anticipated demand or net realizable value. the company performs a detailed review of inventory each fiscal quarter that considers multiple factors including demand forecasts,
product life cycle status, product development plans, current sales levels, and component cost trends. the industries in which the company competes are subject to a rapid and unpredictable pace of product and component obsolescence and demand
changes. if future demand or market conditions for the companys products are less favorable than forecasted or if unforeseen technological changes negatively impact the utility of component inventory, the company may be required to record
additional write-downs, which would adversely affect its results of operations in the period when the write-downs were recorded.the company records accruals for estimated cancellation fees related to component orders that have been cancelled or are expected to be cancelled. consistent with industry practice, the company acquires
components through a combination of purchase orders, supplier contracts, and open orders based on projected demand information. these commitments typically cover the companys requirements for periods up to 150 days. if there is an abrupt and
substantial decline in demand for one or more of the companys products or an unanticipated change in technological requirements for any of the companys products, the company may be required to record additional accruals for cancellation
fees that would adversely affect its results of operations in the period when the cancellation fees are identified and recorded.warranty
coststhe company provides for the estimated cost of hardware and software warranties at the time the related revenue is
recognized based on historical and projected warranty claim rates, historical and projected cost-per-claim, and knowledge of specific product failures that are outside of the companys typical experience. each quarter, the company reevaluates
its estimates to assess the adequacy of its recorded warranty liabilities considering the size of the installed base of products subject to warranty protection and adjusts the amounts as necessary. if actual product failure rates or repair costs
differ from estimates, revisions to the estimated warranty liabilities would be required and could materially affect the companys results of operations.income taxesthe company records a tax provision for the anticipated tax
consequences of the reported results of operations. the provision for income taxes is computed using the asset and liability method, under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary
differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to taxable
income in effect for the years in which those tax assets are expected to be realized or settled. the company records a28



valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is believed more likely than not to be realized.the company recognizes tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical
merits of the position. the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement.management believes it is more likely than not that forecasted income, including income that may be generated as a result of certain tax
planning strategies, together with future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, will be sufficient to fully recover the deferred tax assets. in the event that the company determines all or part of the net deferred tax assets are not
realizable in the future, the company will make an adjustment to the valuation allowance that would be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made. in addition, the calculation of tax liabilities involves significant judgment in
estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of gaap and complex tax laws. resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with managements expectations could have a material impact on the companys financial
condition and operating results.legal and other contingenciesas discussed in part i, item 3 of this form 10-k under the heading legal proceedings and in part ii, item 8 of this
form 10-k in the notes to consolidated financial statements in note 7, commitments and contingencies, the company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims, including those that arise in the ordinary course of business. the
company records a liability when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable. there is significant judgment required in both the probability determination and as to whether an exposure can be reasonably
estimated. in the opinion of management, there was not at least a reasonable possibility the company may have incurred a material loss, or a material loss in excess of a recorded accrual, with respect to loss contingencies for legal and other
contingencies. however, the outcome of legal proceedings and claims brought against the company is subject to significant uncertainty. therefore, although management considers the likelihood of such an outcome to be remote, if one or more of these
legal matters were resolved against the company in a reporting period for amounts in excess of managements expectations, the companys consolidated financial statements for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected.fiscal periodthe companys fiscal year is the 52 or 53-week period that ends on the last saturday of september. the companys fiscal years 2012, 2011 and 2010 ended on september 29,
2012, september 24, 2011, and september 25, 2010, respectively. fiscal year 2012 spanned 53 weeks, with a 14th week included in the first quarter of 2012, as is done approximately every six years to realign the companys
fiscal quarters more closely to calendar quarters. inclusion of the additional week in 2012 increased the companys overall net sales and operating expenses for the year. fiscal years 2011 and 2010 spanned 52
weeks each. unless otherwise stated, references to particular years or quarters refer to the companys fiscal years ended in september and the associated quarters of those fiscal years.29

fiscal year 2012 versus 2011net sales during 2012 increased $48.3 billion or 45% compared to 2011. several factors contributed positively to this
increase, including the addition of a 14th week in the
first quarter of 2012, as well as the following:net sales of iphone and related products and services were $80.5 billion in 2012, representing an increase of $33.4 billion or 71% compared to 2011.
iphone unit sales totaled 125.0 million during 2012, representing an increase of 52.8 million units or 73% compared to 2011. the year-over-year growth in iphone net sales and unit sales during 2012 reflects strong demand for iphone in all
of the companys operating segments, which is primarily a result of the launches of iphone 4s in the first quarter of 2012 and iphone 5 in the fourth quarter of 2012, ongoing demand for iphone 4 and iphone 3gs, and expanded distribution with
new carriers and resellers. net sales of iphone and related products and services were 51% and 43% of the companys total net sales for 2012 and 2011, respectively.net sales of ipad and related products and services were $32.4 billion in 2012, representing an increase of $12.1 billion or 59% compared to 2011.
unit sales of ipad were 58.3 million during 2012, an increase of 80% from 2011. the year-over-year increase in ipad net sales and unit sales during 2012 was driven by strong demand for ipad in all of the companys operating segments as a
result of the launch of the new ipad in march 2012, continued demand for ipad 2, and expanded distribution with new resellers. the year-over-year growth rate of ipad unit sales was higher than the growth rate of ipad net sales during 2012 due to a
reduction of average selling prices as a result of a shift in product mix toward lower-priced ipad models, the price reduction for ipad 2 and an increase in indirect sales due to expanded distribution through third-party resellers. net sales of ipad
and related products and services were 21% and 19% of the companys total net sales for 2012 and 2011, respectively.mac net sales were $23.2 billion in 2012, representing an increase of $1.4 billion or 7% compared to 2011. mac unit sales totaled 18.2 million
during 2012, representing an increase of 1.4 million or 9% compared to 2011. the year-over-year growth in mac net sales and unit sales during 2012 reflects increased demand for mac portables in all of the companys operating segments
driven by 2012 releases of updated models of macbook air and macbook pro, including the new macbook pro with retina display in june 2012. partially offsetting the increase in net sales of mac portables was a decline in net sales of mac desktops that
reflected the overall decline in the market for desktop personal computers during 2012. additionally, the company did not introduce updated versions of its mac desktop products in 2012. mac net sales were 15% and 20% of the companys total net
sales for 2012 and 2011, respectively.net sales of other music related products and services were $8.5 billion in 2012, representing an increase of $2.2 billion or 35% compared to 2011.
the increase was due primarily to growth of the itunes store, which generated total net sales of $7.5 billion for 2012 compared to net sales of $5.4 billion during 2011. the strong results of the itunes store reflect growth of the app store;
growth of the companys customer base; and the continued expansion of third-party audio, video and book content available for sale or rent via the itunes store. the company continues to expand its itunes content and applications offerings
around the world. net sales of other music related products and services were 5% and 6% of the companys total net sales for 2012 and 2011, respectively.partially offsetting the positive factors contributing to the overall increase in net sales was a decrease in ipod net sales experienced
across all operating segments. ipod net sales were $5.6 billion in 2012, a decrease of $1.8 billion or 25% compared to 2011. similarly, ipod unit sales decreased by 17% in 2012 compared to 2011. declines in net sales and unit sales of ipod
reflect the continuing contraction of the overall market for mp3 players. net sales of ipod were 4% and 7% of the companys total net sales for 2012 and 2011, respectively.the company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first fiscal quarter compared to other quarters in its fiscal year due
in part to holiday seasonal demand. actual and anticipated timing of new product introductions31



by the company can also significantly impact the level of net sales experienced by the company in any particular quarter. however, neither historical seasonal patterns nor historical patterns of
product introductions should be considered reliable indicators of the companys future net sales or financial performance.growth in total net sales was particularly strong during the first six months of 2012, rising $34.1 billion or 66% compared to the same period in 2011. the net sales growth during the first six months of
2012 reflects the launch of iphone 4s in the first quarter of 2012 and the companys ability to meet demand more quickly for iphone 4s when compared to the iphone 4 launch. growth during the first half of 2012 was also favorably impacted by the
addition of a 14th week in the first quarter of 2012 and
strong unit sales of ipad during the holiday season, resulting in a 111% increase in ipad unit sales during the first quarter of 2012 compared to the same quarter in 2011.fiscal year 2011 versus 2010net sales during 2011 increased $43.0
billion or 66% compared to 2010. several factors contributed positively to this increase, including the following:net sales of iphone and related products and services were $47.1 billion in 2011, representing an increase of $21.9 billion or 87% compared to 2010.
iphone unit sales totaled 72.3 million during 2011, representing an increase of 32.3 million units or 81% compared to 2010. iphone year-over-year net sales growth reflected strong demand for iphone 4 in all of the companys operating
segments. the expanded u.s. distribution of iphone to the verizon wireless network beginning in february 2011, continued expansion into new countries, and increased distribution with other new carriers and resellers also contributed to the
year-over-year growth of iphone. net sales of iphone and related products and services accounted for 43% and 39% of the companys total net sales for 2011 and 2010, respectively.net sales of ipad and related products and services, which the company introduced in the third quarter of 2010, were $20.4 billion in 2011,
representing an increase of $15.4 billion or 311% compared to 2010. unit sales of ipad were 32.4 million during 2011, an increase of 334% from 2010. the year-over-year unit growth and net sales growth were driven by strong ipad demand in all of
the companys operating segments. net sales of ipad and related products and services accounted for 19% and 8% of the companys total net sales for 2011 and 2010, respectively.mac net sales were $21.8 billion in 2011, representing an increase of $4.3 billion or 25% compared to 2010. mac unit sales increased by
3.1 million or 22% in 2011 compared to 2010. the year-over-year growth in mac net sales and unit sales was due primarily to higher demand in all of the companys operating segments for macbook air and macbook pro, which were updated in
july 2011 and february 2011, respectively. the year-over-year revenue growth for portables and desktops was 36% and 4%, respectively. mac net sales accounted for 20% and 27% of the companys total net sales for 2011 and 2010, respectively.net sales of other music related products and services were $6.3 billion in 2011, representing an increase of $1.4 billion or 28% compared to 2010.
the increase was due primarily to increased net sales from the itunes store, which was largely driven by app store expansion into new countries that contributed to strong growth in all of the companys geographic segments. during 2011, net
sales for the itunes store, app store and ibookstore was $5.4 billion, representing an increase of 33% compared to 2010. the company believes this continued growth was the result of heightened consumer interest in downloading third-party digital
content, continued growth in its customer base of ios devices, expansion of third-party audio and video content available via the itunes store, and continued interest in and growth of the app store. net sales of other music related products and
services accounted for 6% and 8% of the companys total net sales for 2011 and 2010, respectively.partially offsetting the positive factors contributing to the overall increase in net sales was a decrease in ipod net sales of $821
million or 10% during 2011 compared to 2010. similarly, ipod unit sales decreased by 15% in 2011 compared to 2010. however, net sales per ipod unit sold increased during 2011 compared to 2010 due primarily32



to a shift in ipod product mix toward ipod touch. net sales of ipod accounted for 7% and 13% of the companys total net sales for 2011 and 2010, respectively.segment operating performancethe company manages its business primarily on a geographic basis. the companys reportable operating segments consist of the americas, europe, japan, asia-pacific and retail operations. the results
of the americas, europe, japan and asia-pacific segments do not include results of the retail segment. the americas segment includes both north and south america. the europe segment includes european countries, as well as the middle east and africa.
the asia-pacific segment includes australia and asian countries, other than japan. the retail segment operates apple retail stores in 13 countries, including the u.s. each operating segment provides similar hardware and software products and similar
services. further information regarding the companys operating segments may be found in part ii, item 8 of this form 10-k in the notes to consolidated financial statements in note 8, segment information and geographic data.americasnet sales in the americas segment increased $19.2 billion or 50% during 2012 compared to 2011. the growth in net sales during 2012 was
primarily driven by increased demand for iphone following the launches of iphone 4s and iphone 5, strong demand for the new ipad and ipad 2, and higher sales from the itunes store. the americas segment represented approximately 37% and 35% of the
companys total net sales for 2012 and 2011, respectively.net sales in the americas segment increased $13.8 billion or
56% during 2011 compared to 2010. the primary contributors to the growth in net sales was a significant year-over-year increase in iphone sales from carrier expansion and strong demand for iphone 4 and increased sales of ipad and mac, partially
offset by a decrease in ipod sales. higher sales of third-party digital content and applications from the itunes store also drove an increase in net sales during 2011. the americas segment represented approximately 35% and 37% of the companys
total net sales for 2011 and 2010, respectively.europenet sales in the europe segment increased $8.5 billion or 31% during 2012 compared to 2011. the growth in net sales during 2012 was primarily driven by strong demand for the new ipad and ipad 2, higher
sales from the itunes store and increased demand for iphone from the launch of iphone 4s. iphone 5 was launched in a limited number of countries in the europe segment at the end of the fourth quarter of 2012 and did not contribute to the growth in
net sales in the europe segment to the extent it did in other segments. lower year-over-year growth in net sales in the europe segment during 2012 compared to the companys other geographic segments reflects growth in iphone unit sales that was
well below the growth rates experienced by the companys other operating segments, partially offset by strong growth in ipad unit sales. net sales in the europe segment were also negatively impacted by the regions uncertain economic
conditions and the strength in the u.s. dollar relative to several european currencies, including the euro. the europe segment represented approximately 23% and 26% of the companys total net sales for 2012 and 2011, respectively.net sales in the europe segment increased $9.1 billion or 49% during 2011 compared to 2010. the increase in net sales during 2011 was
attributable primarily to the continued year-over-year increase in iphone sales from carrier expansion and strong demand for iphone 4, and increased sales of ipad and mac, partially offset by a decrease in ipod sales. the europe segment represented
26% and 29% of the companys total net sales for 2011 and 2010, respectively.33



japannet sales in the japan segment increased $5.1 billion or 94% during 2012 compared to 2011. the growth in net sales during 2012 was primarily driven by increased demand for iphone following the launches of
iphone 4s and iphone 5, expanded distribution with a new iphone carrier, strong demand for the new ipad and ipad 2, higher sales from the itunes store, and strength in the japanese yen relative to the u.s. dollar. the japan segment represented
approximately 7% and 5% of the companys total net sales for 2012 and 2011, respectively.net sales in the japan segment
increased $1.5 billion or 37% during 2011 compared to 2010. the key contributors to japans net sales growth were increased iphone sales, strong sales of ipad, increased sales of mac, and strength in the japanese yen relative to the u.s.
dollar. the japan segment represented 5% and 6% of the companys total net sales for 2011 and 2010, respectively.asia-pacificnet sales in the asia-pacific segment increased $10.7 billion or 47% during 2012 compared to 2011. the growth in net sales
during 2012 was mainly due to increased demand for iphone from the launch of iphone 4s, strong demand for the new ipad and ipad 2, and higher mac sales. growth in the asia pacific segment was affected by the timing of iphone and ipad product
launches. iphone 5 was launched in a limited number of countries in the asia pacific segment during the fourth quarter of 2012 and was not launched in china during 2012, and the new ipad that was introduced by the company in march 2012 was not
launched in china until the fourth quarter of 2012. the asia-pacific segment represented approximately 21% of the companys total net sales in both 2012 and 2011.net sales in the asia pacific segment increased $14.3 billion or 174% during 2011 compared to 2010. the company experienced particularly strong year-over-year net sales growth in its asia pacific segment
during 2011, especially in greater china, which includes hong kong and taiwan. korea and australia also experienced strong year-over-year revenue growth. higher net sales in the asia pacific segment were due mainly to the increase in iphone sales
primarily attributable to the strong demand for iphone 4 and carrier expansion, strong sales of ipad, and increased mac sales. the asia pacific segment represented 21% and 13% of the companys total net sales in 2011 and 2010, respectively.retailnet
sales in the retail segment increased $4.7 billion or 33% during 2012 compared to 2011. the growth in net sales during 2012 was driven primarily by increased demand for iphone following the launches of iphone 4s and iphone 5, strong demand for the
new ipad and ipad 2, and higher mac net sales. lower year-over-year growth in net sales in the retail segment during 2012 compared to the companys other segments reflects the significant growth in ipad indirect distribution channel
expansion. the retail segment accounted for 12% and 13% of the companys total net sales for 2012 and 2011, respectively.the company opened 33 new retail stores during 2012, 28 of which were outside the u.s., ending the year with 390 stores open compared to 357 stores at the end of 2011. as of september 29, 2012, the
company had a total of 250 u.s. retail stores and 140 international retail stores. with an average of 365 stores and 326 stores during 2012 and 2011, respectively, average revenue per store increased 19% to $51.5 million in 2012 compared to $43.3
million in 2011.net sales in the retail segment increased $4.3 billion or 44% during 2011 compared to 2010. the increase in
net sales was driven primarily by strong demand for ipad, higher mac sales, and an increase in iphone sales. the company opened 40 new retail stores during 2011, 28 of which were outside the u.s., ending the year with 357 stores open compared
to 317 stores at the end of 2010. as of september 24, 2011, the company had a total of 245 u.s. retail stores and 112 international retail stores. during 2011, the company had an average of 326 stores compared to an average of 288 stores
during 2010. the average revenue per store increased 27% to34

$43.3 million in 2011 compared to $34.1 million in 2010. the retail segment represented 13% and 15% of the companys total net sales in 2011 and 2010, respectively.the retail segments operating income was $4.7 billion, $3.2 billion, and $2.3 billion during 2012, 2011, and 2010 respectively.
these year-over-year increases in retail operating income were primarily attributable to higher overall net sales that resulted in significantly higher average revenue per store during the respective years.gross margingross
margin for 2012, 2011 and 2010 are as follows (in millions, except gross margin percentages):net salescost of salesgross margingross margin percentagethe gross margin percentage in 2012 was 43.9%, compared to 40.5% in 2011. this year-over-year increase in
gross margin was largely driven by lower commodity and other product costs, a higher mix of iphone sales, and improved leverage on fixed costs from higher net sales. the increase in gross margin was partially offset by the impact of a stronger u.s.
dollar. the gross margin percentage during the first half of 2012 was 45.9% compared to 41.4% during the second half of 2012. the primary drivers of higher gross margin in the first half of 2012 compared to the second half are a higher mix of iphone
sales and improved leverage on fixed costs from higher net sales. additionally, gross margin in the second half of 2012 was also affected by the introduction of new products with flat pricing that have higher cost structures and deliver
greater value to customers, price reductions on certain existing products, higher transition costs associated with product launches, and continued strengthening of the u.s. dollar; partially offset by lower commodity costs.the gross margin percentage in 2011 was 40.5%, compared to 39.4% in 2010. this year-over-year increase in gross margin was largely driven
by lower commodity and other product costs.the company expects to experience decreases in its gross margin percentage in
future periods, as compared to levels achieved during 2012, and the company anticipates gross margin of about 36% during the first quarter of 2013. expected future declines in gross margin are largely due to a higher mix of new and innovative
products with flat or reduced pricing that have higher cost structures and deliver greater value to customers and anticipated component cost and other cost increases. future strengthening of the u.s. dollar could further negatively impact gross
margin.the foregoing statements regarding the companys expected gross margin percentage in future periods, including
the first quarter of 2013, are forward-looking and could differ from actual results because of several factors including, but not limited to those set forth above in part i, item 1a of this form 10-k under the heading risk factors
and those described in this paragraph. in general, gross margins and margins on individual products will remain under downward pressure due to a variety of factors, including continued industry wide global product pricing pressures, increased
competition, compressed product life cycles, product transitions and potential increases in the cost of components, as well as potential increases in the costs of outside manufacturing services and a potential shift in the companys sales mix
towards products with lower gross margins. in response to competitive pressures, the company expects it will continue to take product pricing actions, which would adversely affect gross margins. gross margins could also be affected by the
companys ability to manage product quality and warranty costs effectively and to stimulate demand for certain of its products. due to the companys significant international operations, financial results can be significantly affected in
the short-term by fluctuations in exchange rates.35

r&d expense was driven by an increase in headcount and related expenses to support expanded r&d activities. although total r&d expense increased 39% and 36% in 2012 and 2011, respectively, it remained fairly consistent as a percentage of
net sales.the company continues to believe that focused investments in r&d are critical to its future growth and
competitive position in the marketplace and are directly related to timely development of new and enhanced products that are central to the companys core business strategy. as such, the company expects to make further investments in r&d to
remain competitive.selling, general and administrative (sg&a) expensesg&a expense increased $2.4 billion or 32% during 2012 compared to 2011 and $2.1 billion or 38% during 2011 compared to 2010. these
increases were primarily due to the companys continued expansion of its retail segment, increased headcount and related expenses, higher spending on professional services, marketing and advertising programs, and increased variable costs
associated with the overall growth of the companys net sales.other income and expenseother income and expense for 2012, 2011, and 2010 are as follows (in millions):interest and dividend incomeother expense, nettotal other income/(expense), nettotal other income and expense increased $107 million or 26% to $522 million during 2012 compared to
$415 million and $155 million in 2011 and 2010, respectively. the year-over-year increase in other income and expense during 2012 was due primarily to higher interest and dividend income on the companys higher cash, cash equivalents and
marketable securities balances, partially offset by higher premium expenses on foreign exchange contracts. the overall increase in other income and expense in 2011 compared to 2010 was attributable to higher interest income and net realized gains on
sales of marketable securities. the weighted average interest rate earned by the company on its cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities was 1.03%, 0.77%, and 0.75% during 2012, 2011, and 2010, respectively. during 2012, 2011, and 2010, the
company had no debt outstanding and accordingly did not incur any related interest expense.provision for income taxesthe companys effective tax rates were approximately 25.2%, 24.2%, and 24.4% for 2012, 2011, and 2010, respectively. the

35% due primarily to certain undistributed foreign earnings for which no u.s. taxes are provided because such earnings are intended to be indefinitely reinvested outside the u.s.as of september 29, 2012, the company had deferred tax assets arising from deductible temporary differences, tax losses, and tax
credits of $4.0 billion, and deferred tax liabilities of $14.9 billion. management believes it is more likely than not that forecasted income, including income that may be generated as a result of certain tax planning strategies, together with
future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, will be sufficient to fully recover the deferred tax assets. the company will continue to evaluate the realizability of deferred tax assets quarterly by assessing the need for and amount of
a valuation allowance.the internal revenue service (the irs) has completed its field audit of the companys
federal income tax returns for the years 2004 through 2006 and proposed certain adjustments. the company has contested certain of these adjustments through the irs appeals office. the irs is currently examining the years 2007 through 2009. all irs
audit issues for years prior to 2004 have been resolved. in addition, the company is subject to audits by state, local, and foreign tax authorities. management believes that adequate provisions have been made for any adjustments that may result
from tax examinations. however, the outcome of tax audits cannot be predicted with certainty. if any issues addressed in the companys tax audits are resolved in a manner not consistent with managements expectations, the company could be
required to adjust its provision for income taxes in the period such resolution occurs.liquidity and capital resourcesthe following table presents selected financial information and statistics as of and for the years ended september 29,

securities, an increase of $39.7 billion or 49% from september 24, 2011. the principal components of this net increase was the cash generated by operating activities of $50.9 billion, which was partially offset by payments for acquisition of
property, plant and equipment of $8.3 billion, payments for acquisition of intangible assets of $1.1 billion and payments of dividends and dividend equivalent rights of $2.5 billion.the companys marketable securities investment portfolio is invested primarily in highly-rated securities and its investment policy
generally limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. the policy requires investments generally to be investment grade with the objective of minimizing the potential risk of principal loss. as of september 29, 2012 and
september 24, 2011, $82.6 billion and $54.3 billion, respectively, of the companys cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities were held by foreign subsidiaries and are generally based in u.s. dollar-denominated holdings. amounts
held by foreign subsidiaries are generally subject to u.s. income taxation on repatriation to the u.s. the company believes its existing balances of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities will be sufficient to satisfy its working capital
needs, capital asset purchases, outstanding commitments, common stock repurchases, dividends on its common stock, and other liquidity requirements associated with its existing operations over the next 12 months.capital assetsthe
companys capital expenditures were $10.3 billion during 2012, consisting of $865 million for retail store facilities and $9.5 billion for other capital expenditures, including product tooling and manufacturing process37

equipment, and other corporate facilities and infrastructure. the companys actual cash payments for capital expenditures during 2012 were $8.3 billion.the company anticipates utilizing approximately $10 billion for capital expenditures during 2013, including approximately $850 million
for retail store facilities and approximately $9.15 billion for other capital expenditures, including product tooling and manufacturing process equipment, and corporate facilities and infrastructure, including information systems hardware, software
and enhancements.during 2013, the company expects to open about 30 to 35 new retail stores, with approximately
three-quarters located outside of the u.s.dividend and stock repurchase programin march 2012, the board of directors of the company approved a dividend policy pursuant to which it plans to pay, subject to subsequent
declaration, quarterly dividends of $2.65 per share. the company expects to pay approximately $2.5 billion each quarter in conjunction with the quarterly declared dividends.in march 2012, the companys board of directors authorized a program to repurchase up to $10 billion of the companys common stock beginning in 2013. the repurchase program is expected to be
executed over a three-year period with the primary objective of neutralizing the impact of dilution from future employee equity grants and employee stock purchase programs. the repurchase program does not obligate the company to acquire any specific
number of shares. the company anticipates that it will utilize approximately $45 billion of domestic cash to pay dividends, repurchase shares, and to remit withheld taxes related to net share settlement of restricted stock units in the first three
years of the dividend and stock repurchase programs. the company anticipates the cash used for future dividends and the repurchase program will come primarily from current domestic cash and from on-going u.s. operating activities and the cash
generated from such activities.off-balance sheet arrangements and contractual obligationsthe company has not entered into any transactions with unconsolidated entities whereby the company has financial guarantees, subordinated
retained interests, derivative instruments, or other contingent arrangements that expose the company to material continuing risks, contingent liabilities, or any other obligation under a variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides
financing, liquidity, market risk, or credit risk support to the company.the following table presents certain payments due
by the company under contractual obligations with minimum firm commitments as of september 29, 2012 and excludes amounts already recorded on the consolidated balance sheet (in millions):operating leasespurchase obligationsother obligationstotallease commitmentsthe companys major facility leases are typically for terms not exceeding 10 years and generally provide renewal options for terms not exceeding five additional years. leases for retail space are for
terms ranging from38



five to 20 years, the majority of which are for 10 years, and often contain multi-year renewal options. as of september 29, 2012, the companys total future minimum lease payments under
noncancelable operating leases were $4.4 billion, of which $3.1 billion related to leases for retail space.purchase commitments with
outsourcing partners and component suppliersthe company utilizes several outsourcing partners to manufacture
sub-assemblies for the companys products and to perform final assembly and testing of finished products. these outsourcing partners acquire components and build product based on demand information supplied by the company, which typically
covers periods up to 150 days. the company also obtains individual components for its products from a wide variety of individual suppliers. consistent with industry practice, the company acquires components through a combination of purchase orders,
supplier contracts, and open orders based on projected demand information. as of september 29, 2012, the company had outstanding off-balance sheet third-party manufacturing commitments and component purchase commitments of $21.1 billion.other obligationsin addition to the off-balance sheet commitments mentioned above, the company had outstanding obligations of $988 million as of september 29, 2012, that were comprised mainly of commitments to
acquire capital assets, including product tooling and manufacturing process equipment, and commitments related to advertising, research and development, internet and telecommunications services and other obligations.the companys other non-current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets consist primarily of deferred tax liabilities, gross
unrecognized tax benefits and the related gross interest and penalties. as of september 29, 2012, the company had non-current deferred tax liabilities of $13.8 billion. additionally, as of september 29, 2012, the company had gross
unrecognized tax benefits of $2.1 billion and an additional $401 million for gross interest and penalties classified as non-current liabilities. at this time, the company is unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments in
individual years in connection with these tax liabilities; therefore, such amounts are not included in the above contractual obligation table.indemnificationthe
company generally does not indemnify end-users of its operating system and application software against legal claims that the software infringes third-party intellectual property rights. other agreements entered into by the company sometimes include
indemnification provisions under which the company could be subject to costs and/or damages in the event of an infringement claim against the company or an indemnified third-party. however, the company has not been required to make any significant
payments resulting from such an infringement claim asserted against it or an indemnified third-party. in the opinion of management, there was not at least a reasonable possibility the company may have incurred a material loss with respect to
indemnification of end-users of its operating system or application software for infringement of third-party intellectual property rights. the company did not record a liability for infringement costs related to indemnification as of
september 29, 2012 or september 24, 2011.the company has entered into indemnification agreements with its
directors and executive officers. under these agreements, the company has agreed to indemnify such individuals to the fullest extent permitted by law against liabilities that arise by reason of their status as directors or officers and to advance
expenses incurred by such individuals in connection with related legal proceedings. it is not possible to determine the maximum potential amount of payments the company could be required to make under these agreements due to the limited history of
prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each claim. however, the company maintains directors and officers liability insurance coverage to reduce its exposure to such obligations, and payments made under these
agreements historically have not been material.39


## Item 7A


to provide a meaningful assessment of the foreign currency risk associated with certain of
the companys foreign currency derivative positions, the company performed a sensitivity analysis using a value-at-risk (var) model to assess the potential impact of fluctuations in exchange rates. the var model consisted of using a
monte carlo simulation to generate thousands of random market price paths assuming normal market conditions. the var is the maximum expected loss in fair value, for a given confidence interval, to the companys foreign currency derivative
positions due to adverse movements in rates. the var model is not intended to represent actual losses but is used as a risk estimation and management tool. the model assumes normal market conditions. forecasted transactions, firm commitments, and
assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies were excluded from the model. based on the results of the model, the company estimates with 95% confidence a maximum one-day loss in fair value of $200 million as of september 29, 2012
compared to a maximum one-day loss in fair value of $161 million as of september 24, 2011. because the company uses foreign currency instruments for hedging purposes, the loss in fair value incurred on those instruments are generally offset by
increases in the fair value of the underlying exposures.actual future gains and losses associated with the companys
investment portfolio and derivative positions may differ materially from the sensitivity analyses performed as of september 29, 2012 due to the inherent limitations associated with predicting the timing and amount of changes in interest rates,
foreign currency exchanges rates and the companys actual exposures and positions.41

notes to consolidated financial statementsnote 1  summary of significant accounting policiesapple inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries (collectively apple or the company) designs,
manufactures, and markets mobile communication and media devices, personal computers, and portable digital music players, and sells a variety of related software, services, peripherals, networking solutions, and third-party digital content and
applications. the company sells its products worldwide through its retail stores, online stores, and direct sales force, as well as through third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers and value-added resellers. in addition, the
company sells a variety of third-party iphone, ipad, mac, and ipod compatible products including application software, and various accessories through its online and retail stores. the company sells to consumers, small and mid-sized businesses, and
education, enterprise and government customers.basis of presentation and preparationthe accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the company. intercompany accounts and transactions have been
eliminated. the preparation of these consolidated financial statements in conformity with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles (gaap) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in
these consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. actual results could differ materially from those estimates. certain prior year amounts in the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto have been reclassified to conform to
the current years presentation. prior period costs associated with the companys high-profile retail stores have been reclassified to conform to the current periods presentation. refer to note 8, segment information and
geographic data of this form 10-k.the companys fiscal year is the 52 or 53-week period that ends on the last
saturday of september. the companys fiscal years 2012, 2011 and 2010 ended on september 29, 2012, september 24, 2011, and september 25, 2010, respectively. an additional week is included in the first fiscal quarter
approximately every six years to realign fiscal quarters with calendar quarters. fiscal year 2012 spanned 53 weeks, with a 14th week included in the first quarter of 2012. fiscal years 2011 and 2010 spanned 52 weeks each. unless otherwise stated,
references to particular years or quarters refer to the companys fiscal years ended in september and the associated quarters of those fiscal years.revenue recognitionnet sales consist primarily of revenue from the sale
of hardware, software, digital content and applications, peripherals, and service and support contracts. the company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the sales price is fixed or
determinable, and collection is probable. product is considered delivered to the customer once it has been shipped and title and risk of loss have been transferred. for most of the companys product sales, these criteria are met at the time the
product is shipped. for online sales to individuals, for some sales to education customers in the u.s., and for certain other sales, the company defers revenue until the customer receives the product because the company retains a portion of the risk
of loss on these sales during transit. the company recognizes revenue from the sale of hardware products, software bundled with hardware that is essential to the functionality of the hardware, and third-party digital content sold on the itunes store
in accordance with general revenue recognition accounting guidance. the company recognizes revenue in accordance with industry specific software accounting guidance for the following types of sales transactions: (i) standalone sales of software
products, (ii) sales of software upgrades and (iii) sales of software bundled with hardware not essential to the functionality of the hardware.for the sale of most third-party products, the company recognizes revenue based on the gross amount billed to customers because the company establishes its own pricing for such products, retains related
inventory risk for physical products, is the primary obligor to the customer and assumes the credit risk for amounts billed to its47



customers. for third-party applications sold through the app store and mac app store and certain digital content sold through the itunes store, the company does not determine the selling price of
the products and is not the primary obligor to the customer. therefore, the company accounts for such sales on a net basis by recognizing in net sales only the commission it retains from each sale. the portion of the gross amount billed to customers
that is remitted by the company to third-party app developers and certain digital content owners is not reflected in the companys consolidated statements of operations.the company records deferred revenue when it receives payments in advance of the delivery of products or the performance of services. this includes amounts that have been deferred for unspecified and
specified software upgrade rights and non-software services that are attached to hardware and software products. the company sells gift cards redeemable at its retail and online stores, and also sells gift cards redeemable on the itunes store for
the purchase of digital content and software. the company records deferred revenue upon the sale of the card, which is relieved upon redemption of the card by the customer. revenue from applecare service and support contracts is deferred and
recognized over the service coverage periods. applecare service and support contracts typically include extended phone support, repair services, web-based support resources and diagnostic tools offered under the companys standard limited
warranty.the company records reductions to revenue for estimated commitments related to price protection and other customer
incentive programs. for transactions involving price protection, the company recognizes revenue net of the estimated amount to be refunded. for the companys other customer incentive programs, the estimated cost of these programs is recognized
at the later of the date at which the company has sold the product or the date at which the program is offered. the company also records reductions to revenue for expected future product returns based on the companys historical experience.
revenue is recorded net of taxes collected from customers that are remitted to governmental authorities, with the collected taxes recorded as current liabilities until remitted to the relevant government authority.revenue recognition for arrangements with multiple deliverablesfor multi-element arrangements that include hardware products containing software essential to the hardware products functionality, undelivered software elements that relate to the hardware
products essential software, and undelivered non-software services, the company allocates revenue to all deliverables based on their relative selling prices. in such circumstances, the company uses a hierarchy to determine the selling price to
be used for allocating revenue to deliverables: (i) vendor-specific objective evidence of fair value (vsoe), (ii) third-party evidence of selling price (tpe), and (iii) best estimate of selling price
(esp). vsoe generally exists only when the company sells the deliverable separately and is the price actually charged by the company for that deliverable. esps reflect the companys best estimates of what the selling prices of
elements would be if they were sold regularly on a stand-alone basis. for multi-element arrangements accounted for in accordance with industry specific software accounting guidance, the company allocates revenue to all deliverables based on the vsoe
of each element, and if vsoe does not exist revenue is recognized when elements lacking vsoe are delivered.for sales of
qualifying versions of iphone, ipad and ipod touch (ios devices), mac and apple tv, the company has indicated it may from time to time provide future unspecified software upgrades and features to the essential software bundled with each
of these hardware products free of charge to customers. essential software for ios devices includes ios and related applications and for mac includes os x, related applications and ilife. the company also provides various non-software services to
owners of qualifying versions of ios devices and mac. the company has identified up to three deliverables regularly included in arrangements involving the sale of these devices. the first deliverable is the hardware and software essential to the
functionality of the hardware device delivered at the time of sale. the second deliverable is the embedded right included with the purchase of ios devices, mac and apple tv to receive on a when-and-if-available basis, future unspecified software
upgrades and features relating to the products essential software. the third deliverable is the non-software services to be provided to qualifying versions of ios devices and mac. the company allocates revenue between48



these deliverables using the relative selling price method. because the company has neither vsoe nor tpe for these deliverables, the allocation of revenue is based on the companys esps.
revenue allocated to the delivered hardware and the related essential software is recognized at the time of sale provided the other conditions for revenue recognition have been met. revenue allocated to the embedded unspecified software upgrade
rights and the non-software services is deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis over the estimated period the software upgrades and non-software services are expected to be provided for each of these devices, which ranges from two to four
years. cost of sales related to delivered hardware and related essential software, including estimated warranty costs, are recognized at the time of sale. costs incurred to provide non-software services are recognized as cost of sales as incurred,
and engineering and sales and marketing costs are recognized as operating expenses as incurred.the companys process
for determining its esp for deliverables without vsoe or tpe considers multiple factors that may vary depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each deliverable. the company believes its customers would be reluctant to buy
unspecified software upgrade rights for the essential software included with its qualifying hardware products. this view is primarily based on the fact that unspecified software upgrade rights do not obligate the company to provide upgrades at a
particular time or at all, and do not specify to customers which upgrades or features will be delivered. the company also believes its customers would be unwilling to pay a significant amount for access to the non-software services because other
companies offer similar services at little or no cost to users. therefore, the company has concluded that if it were to sell upgrade rights or access to the non-software services on a standalone basis, including those rights and services attached to
ios devices, mac and apple tv, the selling prices would be relatively low. key factors considered by the company in developing the esps for software upgrade rights include prices charged by the company for similar offerings, market trends in the
pricing of apple-branded and third-party mac and ios compatible software, the nature of the upgrade rights (e.g., unspecified versus specified), and the relative esp of the upgrade rights as compared to the total selling price of the product. the
company may also consider additional factors as appropriate, including the impact of other products and services provided to customers, the pricing of competitive alternatives if they exist, product-specific business objectives, and the length of
time a particular version of a device has been available. when relevant, the same factors are considered by the company in developing esps for offerings such as the non-software services; however, the primary consideration in developing esps for the
non-software services is the estimated cost to provide such services, including consideration for a reasonable profit margin.for the three years ended september 29, 2012, the companys combined esps for the unspecified software upgrade rights and the
rights to receive the non-software services included with its qualifying hardware devices have ranged from $5 to $25. revenue allocated to such rights included with ios devices and apple tv is recognized on a straight-line basis over two years, and
revenue allocated to such rights included with mac is recognized on a straight-line basis over four years.shipping costsfor all periods presented, amounts billed to customers related to shipping and handling are classified as revenue, and the companys
shipping and handling costs are included in cost of sales.warranty expensethe company generally provides for the estimated cost of hardware and software warranties at the time the related revenue is recognized.
the company assesses the adequacy of its pre-existing warranty liabilities and adjusts the amounts as necessary based on actual experience and changes in future estimates.software development costsresearch and development costs are expensed as
incurred. development costs of computer software to be sold, leased, or otherwise marketed are subject to capitalization beginning when a products technological feasibility49



has been established and ending when a product is available for general release to customers. in most instances, the companys products are released soon after technological feasibility has
been established. costs incurred subsequent to achievement of technological feasibility were not significant, and generally software development costs were expensed as incurred during 2012, 2011 and 2010.advertising costsadvertising costs are expensed as incurred. advertising expense was $1.0 billion, $933 million and $691 million for 2012, 2011 and 2010,
respectively.share-based compensationthe company recognizes expense related to share-based payment transactions in which it receives employee services in exchange for (a) equity instruments of the company or (b) liabilities that
are based on the fair value of the enterprises equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of such equity instruments. share-based compensation cost for restricted stock units (rsus) is measured based on the closing
fair market value of the companys common stock on the date of grant. share-based compensation cost for stock options is estimated at the grant date based on each options fair-value as calculated by the black-scholes-merton
(bsm) option-pricing model. the company recognizes share-based compensation cost as expense ratably on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. the company recognizes a benefit from share-based compensation in the
consolidated statements of shareholders equity if an incremental tax benefit is realized. in addition, the company recognizes the indirect effects of share-based compensation on research and development tax credits, foreign tax credits and
domestic manufacturing deductions in the consolidated statements of operations. further information regarding share-based compensation can be found in note 6, shareholders equity and share-based compensation of this form 10-k.income taxesthe provision for income taxes is computed using the asset and liability method, under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are
recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. deferred tax assets and liabilities are
measured using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in effect for the years in which those tax assets are expected to be realized or settled. the company records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the
amount that is believed more likely than not to be realized.the company recognizes the tax benefit from an uncertain tax
position only if it is more likely than not the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are
then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon settlement. see note 5, income taxes of this form 10-k for additional information.earnings per sharebasic earnings per share is computed by dividing income available to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of shares of
common stock outstanding during the period. diluted earnings per share is computed by dividing income available to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period increased to include the
number of additional shares of common stock that would have been outstanding if the potentially dilutive securities had been issued. potentially dilutive securities include outstanding stock options, shares to be purchased under the companys
employee stock purchase plan and unvested rsus. the dilutive effect of potentially dilutive securities is reflected in diluted earnings per share by application of the treasury stock method. under the treasury stock method, an increase in50

equivalents and marketable securitiesall highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less at the date of
purchase are classified as cash equivalents. the companys marketable debt and equity securities have been classified and accounted for as available-for-sale. management determines the appropriate classification of its investments at the time
of purchase and reevaluates the designations at each balance sheet date. the company classifies its marketable debt securities as either short-term or long-term based on each instruments underlying contractual maturity date. marketable debt
securities with maturities of 12 months or less are classified as short-term and marketable debt securities with maturities greater than 12 months are classified as long-term. the company classifies its marketable equity securities, including mutual
funds, as either short-term or long-term based on the nature of each security and its availability for use in current operations. the companys marketable debt and equity securities are carried at fair value, with the unrealized gains and
losses, net of taxes, reported as a component of shareholders equity. the cost of securities sold is based upon the specific identification method.derivative financial instrumentsthe company accounts for its derivative instruments as
either assets or liabilities and carries them at fair value.for derivative instruments that hedge the exposure to
variability in expected future cash flows that are designated as cash flow hedges, the effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative instrument is reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (aoci) in
shareholders equity and reclassified into income in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. the ineffective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative instrument, if any, is recognized in current
income. to receive hedge accounting treatment, cash flow hedges must be highly effective in offsetting changes to expected future cash flows on hedged transactions. for options designated as cash flow hedges, changes in the time value are excluded
from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and are recognized in income. for derivative instruments that hedge the exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset or a liability and that are designated as fair value hedges, both the net gain or
loss on the derivative instrument as well as the offsetting gain or loss on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are recognized in earnings in the current period. the company had no fair value51



hedges in 2012, 2011 and 2010. the net gain or loss on the effective portion of a derivative instrument that is designated as an economic hedge of the foreign currency translation exposure of the
net investment in a foreign operation is reported in the same manner as a foreign currency translation adjustment. for forward exchange contracts designated as net investment hedges, the company excludes changes in fair value relating to changes in
the forward carry component from its definition of effectiveness. accordingly, any gains or losses related to this component are recognized in current income. derivatives that do not qualify as hedges must be adjusted to fair value through current
income.allowance for doubtful accountsthe company records its allowance for doubtful accounts based upon its assessment of various factors. the company considers historical experience, the age of the accounts receivable balances, credit
quality of the companys customers, current economic conditions, and other factors that may affect customers ability to pay.inventoriesinventories
are stated at the lower of cost, computed using the first-in, first-out method, or market. if the cost of the inventories exceeds their market value, provisions are made currently for the difference between the cost and the market value. the
companys inventories consist primarily of components and finished goods for all periods presented.property, plant and equipmentproperty, plant and equipment are stated at cost. depreciation is computed by use of the straight-line method over the
estimated useful lives of the assets, which for buildings is the lesser of 30 years or the remaining life of the underlying building; between two to five years for machinery and equipment, including product tooling and manufacturing process
equipment; and the shorter of lease terms or ten years for leasehold improvements. the company capitalizes eligible costs to acquire or develop internal-use software that are incurred subsequent to the preliminary project stage. capitalized costs
related to internal-use software are amortized using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which range from three to five years. depreciation and amortization expense on property and equipment was $2.6 billion, $1.6
billion and $815 million during 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively.long-lived assets including goodwill and other acquired intangible
assetsthe company reviews property, plant and equipment, inventory component prepayments, and certain identifiable
intangibles, excluding goodwill, for impairment. long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. recoverability of these assets is measured by
comparison of their carrying amounts to future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate. if property, plant and equipment, inventory component prepayments, and certain identifiable intangibles are considered to be impaired, the
impairment to be recognized equals the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds its fair market value. the company did not record any significant impairments during 2012, 2011 and 2010.the company does not amortize goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives, rather such assets are required to be tested
for impairment at least annually or sooner whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the assets may be impaired. the company performs its goodwill and intangible asset impairment tests in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year. the
company did not recognize any impairment charges related to goodwill or indefinite lived intangible assets during 2012, 2011 and 2010. the company established reporting units based on its current reporting structure. for purposes of testing goodwill
for impairment, goodwill has been allocated to these reporting units to the extent it relates to each reporting unit. in 2012 and 2011, the companys goodwill was allocated to the americas and europe reportable operating segments.52



the company amortizes its intangible assets with definite lives over their estimated useful
lives and reviews these assets for impairment. the company is currently amortizing its acquired intangible assets with definite lives over periods typically from three to seven years.fair value measurementsthe company applies fair value accounting for all
financial assets and liabilities and non-financial assets and liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis. the company defines fair value as the price that would be received from
selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. when determining the fair value measurements for assets and liabilities, which are required to be recorded at fair value,
the company considers the principal or most advantageous market in which the company would transact and the market-based risk measurements or assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, such as risks inherent in
valuation techniques, transfer restrictions and credit risk. fair value is estimated by applying the following hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value into three levels and bases the categorization within the hierarchy
upon the lowest level of input that is available and significant to the fair value measurement:level 1  quoted prices in active
markets for identical assets or liabilities.level 2  observable inputs other than quoted prices in active
markets for identical assets and liabilities, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in inactive markets, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of
the assets or liabilities.level 3  inputs that are generally unobservable and typically reflect
managements estimate of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability.the
companys valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of money market funds and certain marketable equity securities were derived from quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. the valuation techniques used to
measure the fair value of all other financial instruments, all of which have counterparties with high credit ratings, were valued based on quoted market prices or model driven valuations using significant inputs derived from or corroborated by
observable market data.in accordance with the fair value accounting requirements, companies may choose to measure eligible
financial instruments and certain other items at fair value. the company has not elected the fair value option for any eligible financial instruments.foreign currency translation and remeasurementthe company translates the
assets and liabilities of its non-u.s. dollar functional currency subsidiaries into u.s. dollars using exchange rates in effect at the end of each period. revenue and expenses for these subsidiaries are translated using rates that approximate those
in effect during the period. gains and losses from these translations are recognized in foreign currency translation included in accumulated other comprehensive income in shareholders equity. the companys subsidiaries that use the u.s.
dollar as their functional currency remeasure monetary assets and liabilities at exchange rates in effect at the end of each period, and inventories, property, and nonmonetary assets and liabilities at historical rates. gains and losses from these
remeasurements were not significant and have been included in the companys results of operations.53

the net unrealized gains as of september 29, 2012 and september 24, 2011 are
related primarily to long-term marketable securities. the company may sell certain of its marketable securities prior to their stated maturities for strategic reasons including, but not limited to, anticipation of credit deterioration and duration
management. the net realized gains or losses recognized during 2012 and 2011 were $183 million and $110 million, respectively, and no significant net realized gains or losses during 2010 related to such sales. the maturities of the companys
long-term marketable securities generally range from one to five years.as of september 29, 2012 and september 24,
2011, gross unrealized losses related to individual securities that had been in a continuous loss position for 12 months or longer were not significant.as of september 29, 2012, the company considers the declines in market value of its marketable securities investment portfolio to be temporary in nature and does not consider any of its investments
other-than-temporarily impaired. the company typically invests in highly-rated securities, and its investment policy generally limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. the policy requires investments generally to be investment grade,
with the primary objective of minimizing the potential risk of principal loss. fair values were determined for each individual security in the investment portfolio. when evaluating an investment for other-than-temporary impairment, the company
reviews factors such as the length of time and extent to which fair value has been below its cost basis, the financial condition of the issuer and any changes thereto, and the companys intent to sell, or whether it is more likely than not it
will be required to sell, the investment before recovery of the investments cost basis. during 2012, 2011 and 2010, the company did not recognize any significant impairment charges.derivative financial instrumentsthe company uses derivatives to partially
offset its business exposure to foreign currency exchange risk. the company may enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts to offset some of the foreign exchange risk on expected future cash flows on certain forecasted revenue and cost
of sales, on net investments in certain foreign subsidiaries, and on certain existing assets and liabilities.to help protect
gross margins from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, certain of the companys subsidiaries whose functional currency is the u.s. dollar hedge a portion of forecasted foreign currency revenue. the companys subsidiaries whose
functional currency is not the u.s. dollar and who sell in local currencies may hedge a portion of forecasted inventory purchases not denominated in the subsidiaries functional currencies. the company typically hedges portions of its
forecasted foreign currency exposure associated with revenue and inventory purchases generally up to six months.to help
protect the net investment in a foreign operation from adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates, the company may enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts to offset the changes in the carrying amounts of these investments
due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.the company may also enter into foreign currency forward and option
contracts to partially offset the foreign currency exchange gains and losses generated by the re-measurement of certain assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies. however, the company may choose not to hedge certain foreign
currency exchange exposures for a variety of reasons including, but not limited to, accounting considerations and the prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures. there can be no assurance the hedges will offset more than a portion of
the financial impact resulting from movements in foreign currency exchange rates.the company records all derivatives in the
consolidated balance sheets at fair value. the companys accounting treatment of these instruments is based on whether the instruments are designated as hedge or non-hedge instruments. the effective portions of cash flow hedges are recorded in
aoci until the hedged item is recognized in earnings. the effective portions of net investment hedges are recorded in other comprehensive income as a part of the cumulative translation adjustment. the ineffective portions of cash flow hedges and net55

item to which the derivative relates.the company had a net deferred loss associated with cash flow hedges of approximately
$240 million and a net deferred gain of approximately $290 million, net of taxes, recorded in aoci as of september 29, 2012 and september 24, 2011, respectively. deferred gains and losses associated with cash flow hedges of foreign
currency revenue are recognized as a component of net sales in the same period as the related revenue is recognized, and deferred gains and losses related to cash flow hedges of inventory purchases are recognized as a component of cost of sales in
the same period as the related costs are recognized. the majority of the companys hedged transactions as of september 29, 2012 are expected to occur within six months.derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges must be de-designated as hedges when it is probable the forecasted hedged
transaction will not occur in the initially identified time period or within a subsequent two-month time period. deferred gains and losses in aoci associated with such derivative instruments are reclassified immediately into other income and
expense. any subsequent changes in fair value of such derivative instruments are reflected in other income and expense unless they are re-designated as hedges of other transactions. the company did not recognize any significant net gains or losses
related to the loss of hedge designation on discontinued cash flow hedges during 2012, 2011 and 2010.the companys
unrealized net gains and losses on net investment hedges, included in the cumulative translation adjustment account of aoci, were not significant as of september 29, 2012 and september 24, 2011, respectively. the ineffective portions of
and amounts excluded from the effectiveness test of net investment hedges are recorded in other income and expense.the
gain/loss recognized in other income and expense for foreign currency forward and option contracts not designated as hedging instruments was not significant during 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. these amounts represent the net gain or loss on
the derivative contracts and do not include changes in the related exposures, which generally offset a portion of the gain or loss on the derivative contracts.the following table shows the notional principal amounts of the companys outstanding derivative instruments and credit risk amounts associated with outstanding or unsettled derivative instruments as
of september 29, 2012 and september 24, 2011 (in millions):instruments designated as accounting hedges:foreign exchange contractsinstruments not designated as accounting hedges:foreign exchange contractsthe notional principal amounts for outstanding derivative instruments provide one measure of the
transaction volume outstanding and do not represent the amount of the companys exposure to credit or market loss. the credit risk amounts represent the companys gross exposure to potential accounting loss on derivative instruments that
are outstanding or unsettled if all counterparties failed to perform according to the terms of the contract, based on then-current currency exchange rates at each respective date. the companys gross exposure on these transactions may be
further mitigated by collateral received from certain counterparties. the companys exposure to credit loss and market risk will vary over time as a function of currency exchange rates. although the table above reflects the notional principal
and credit risk amounts of the companys foreign exchange56

instruments, it does not reflect the gains or losses associated with the exposures and transactions that the foreign exchange instruments are intended to hedge. the amounts ultimately realized
upon settlement of these financial instruments, together with the gains and losses on the underlying exposures, will depend on actual market conditions during the remaining life of the instruments.the company generally enters into master netting arrangements, which reduce credit risk by permitting net settlement of transactions with
the same counterparty. to further limit credit risk, the company generally enters into collateral security arrangements that provide for collateral to be received or posted when the net fair value of certain financial instruments fluctuates from
contractually established thresholds. the company presents its derivative assets and derivative liabilities at their gross fair values. as of september 29, 2012, the company posted cash collateral related to the derivative instruments under its
collateral security arrangements of $278 million, which it recorded as other current assets in the consolidated balance sheet. as of september 24, 2011, the company received cash collateral related to the derivative instruments under
its collateral security arrangements of $288 million, which it recorded as accrued expenses in the consolidated balance sheet. the company did not have any derivative instruments with credit-risk related contingent features that would require it to
post additional collateral as of september 29, 2012 or september 24, 2011.the following tables show the

customers; however, the company will require collateral in certain instances to limit credit risk. in addition, when possible, the company attempts to limit credit risk on trade receivables with credit insurance for certain customers or by requiring
third-party financing, loans or leases to support credit exposure. these credit-financing arrangements are directly between the third-party financing company and the end customer. as such, the company generally does not assume any recourse or credit
risk sharing related to any of these arrangements.as of september 29, 2012, the company had two customers that
represented 10% or more of total trade receivables, one of which accounted for 14% and the other 10%. as of september 24, 2011, there were no customers that accounted for 10% or more of the companys total trade receivables. the
companys cellular network carriers accounted for 66% and 52% of trade receivables as of september 29, 2012 and september 24, 2011, respectively. the additions and write-offs to the companys allowance for doubtful accounts
during 2012, 2011 and 2010 were not significant.58

between the fair market value of the stock issued at the time of the exercise and the exercise price. for rsus, the company receives an income tax benefit upon the awards vesting equal
to the tax effect of the underlying stocks fair market value. the company had net excess tax benefits from equity awards of $1.4 billion, $1.1 billion and $742 million in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively, which were reflected as increases to
common stock.as of september 29, 2012 and september 24, 2011, the significant components of the companys

effects of temporary differences between the consolidated financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and are measured using enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in the years in
which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.uncertain tax positionstax positions are evaluated in a two-step process. the company first determines whether it is more likely than not that a tax position
will be sustained upon examination. if a tax position meets the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold it is then measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements. the tax position is measured as the largest
amount of benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. the company classifies gross interest and penalties and unrecognized tax benefits that are not expected to result in payment or receipt of cash within one
year as non-current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets.as of september 29, 2012, the total amount of gross
unrecognized tax benefits was $2.1 billion, of which $889 million, if recognized, would affect the companys effective tax rate. as of september 24, 2011, the total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits was $1.4 billion, of which
$563 million, if recognized, would affect the companys effective tax rate.62

income taxes. as of september 29, 2012 and september 24, 2011, the total amount of gross interest and penalties accrued was $401 million and $261 million, respectively, which is classified as non-current liabilities in the consolidated
balance sheets. in connection with tax matters, the company recognized interest expense in 2012 and 2011 of $140 million and $14 million, respectively, and in 2010 the company recognized an interest benefit of $43 million.the company is subject to taxation and files income tax returns in the u.s. federal jurisdiction and in many state and foreign
jurisdictions. for u.s. federal income tax purposes, all years prior to 2004 are closed. the internal revenue service (the irs) has completed its field audit of the companys federal income tax returns for the years 2004 through
2006 and proposed certain adjustments. the company has contested certain of these adjustments through the irs appeals office. the irs is currently examining the years 2007 through 2009. in addition, the company is also subject to audits by state,
local and foreign tax authorities. in major states and major foreign jurisdictions, the years subsequent to 1989 and 2002, respectively, generally remain open and could be subject to examination by the taxing authorities.management believes that an adequate provision has been made for any adjustments that may result from tax examinations. however, the
outcome of tax audits cannot be predicted with certainty. if any issues addressed in the companys tax audits are resolved in a manner not consistent with managements expectations, the company could be required to adjust its provision for
income tax in the period such resolution occurs. although timing of the resolution and/or closure of audits is not certain, the company believes it is reasonably possible that tax audit resolutions could reduce its unrecognized tax benefits by
between $120 million and $170 million in the next 12 months.note 6  shareholders equity and share-based compensationpreferred stockthe company has five million shares of authorized preferred stock, none of which is issued or outstanding. under the terms of the companys restated articles of incorporation, the board of directors

in 2012, the companys board of directors authorized a program to repurchase up to $10
billion of the companys common stock beginning in 2013. the repurchase program is expected to be executed over a three-year period with the primary objective of neutralizing the impact of dilution from future employee equity grants and
employee stock purchase programs. the repurchase program does not obligate the company to acquire any specific number of shares. in august 2012, the company entered into a rule 10b5-1 compliant accelerated share repurchase (asr)
program with a financial institution to purchase up to $2 billion of the companys common stock during 2013. the total number of shares to be purchased under the asr program will be based on the volume-weighted average price of the
companys common stock during the purchase period and will be reflected as a reduction of shares outstanding on the date of purchase. the company may also purchase its common stock in open market transactions, in compliance with all
applicable securities laws.comprehensive incomecomprehensive income consists of two components, net income and other comprehensive income. other comprehensive income refers to revenue, expenses, and gains and losses that under gaap are recorded as an
element of shareholders equity but are excluded from net income. the companys other comprehensive income consists of foreign currency translation adjustments from those subsidiaries not using the u.s. dollar as their functional currency,
unrealized gains and losses on marketable securities classified as available-for-sale, and net deferred gains and losses on certain derivative instruments accounted for as cash flow hedges.the following table shows the components of aoci, net of taxes, as of september 29, 2012 and september 24, 2011 (in millions):net unrealized gains/losses on marketable securitiesnet unrecognized gains/losses on derivative instrumentscumulative foreign currency translationaccumulated other comprehensive incomethe change in fair value of available-for-sale securities included in other comprehensive income was

employee benefit plans2003 employee stock planthe 2003 employee stock plan (the 2003
plan) is a shareholder approved plan that provides for broad-based equity grants to employees, including executive officers. the 2003 plan permits the granting of incentive stock options, nonstatutory stock options, rsus, stock appreciation
rights, stock purchase rights and performance-based awards. options granted under the 2003 plan generally expire seven to ten years after the grant date and generally become exercisable over a period of four years, based on continued employment,
with either annual, semi-annual or quarterly vesting. in general, rsus granted under the 2003 plan vest over two to four years, based on continued employment and are settled upon vesting in shares of the companys common stock on a one-for-one
basis. each share issued with respect to an award granted under the 2003 plan (other than a stock option or stock appreciation right) reduces the number of shares available for grant under the plan by two shares, whereas shares issued in respect of
an option or stock appreciation right count against the number of shares available for grant on a one-for-one basis. all rsus, other than rsus held by the chief executive officer, granted under the 2003 plan have dividend equivalent rights
(der), which entitle holders of rsus to the same dividend value per share as holders of common stock. der are subject to the same vesting and other terms and conditions as the corresponding unvested rsus. der are accumulated and paid
when the underlying shares vest. as of september 29, 2012, approximately 37.1 million shares were reserved for future issuance under the 2003 plan.1997 director stock planthe 1997 director stock plan (the director
plan) is a shareholder approved plan that (i) permits the company to grant awards of rsus or stock options to the companys non-employee directors, (ii) provides for automatic initial grants of rsus upon a non-employee director
joining the board of directors and automatic annual grants of rsus at each annual meeting of shareholders, and (iii) permits the board of directors to prospectively change the relative mixture of stock options and rsus for the initial and
annual award grants and the methodology for determining the number of shares of the companys common stock subject to these grants without shareholder approval. each share issued with respect to rsus granted under the director plan reduces the
number of shares available for grant under the plan by two shares. the director plan expires november 9, 2019. all rsus granted under the director plan are entitled to der. as of september 29, 2012, approximately 184,000 shares were
reserved for future issuance under the director plan.rule 10b5-1 trading plansduring the fourth quarter of 2012, executive officers timothy d. cook, peter oppenheimer, d. bruce sewell, phillip w. schiller and jeffrey
e. williams, and directors william v. campbell and arthur d. levinson had equity trading plans adopted in accordance with rule 10b5-1(c)(1) under the securities exchange act of 1934, as amended (the exchange act). an equity trading plan
is a written document that pre-establishes the amounts, prices and dates (or a formula for determining the amounts, prices and dates) of future purchases or sales of the companys stock, including shares acquired pursuant to the companys
employee and director equity plans.employee stock purchase planthe employee stock purchase plan (the purchase plan) is a shareholder approved plan under which substantially all employees
may purchase the companys common stock through payroll deductions at a price equal to 85% of the lower of the fair market values of the stock as of the beginning or the end of six-month offering periods. an employees payroll deductions
under the purchase plan are limited to 10% of the employees compensation and employees may not purchase more than $25,000 of stock during any calendar year. as of september 29, 2012, approximately 2.5 million shares were reserved for
future issuance under the purchase plan.65

401(k) planthe companys 401(k) plan (the 401(k) plan) is a deferred salary arrangement under section 401(k) of the internal revenue code. under the 401(k) plan, participating u.s. employees
may defer a portion of their pre-tax earnings, up to the irs annual contribution limit ($17,000 for calendar year 2012). the company matches 50% to 100% of each employees contributions, depending on length of service, up to a maximum 6% of the
employees eligible earnings. the companys matching contributions to the 401(k) plan were $114 million, $90 million and $72 million in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively.restricted stock unitsa summary of the companys rsu activity and

for 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. the majority of rsus that vested in 2012, 2011 and 2010 were net-share settled such that the company withheld shares with value equivalent to the employees minimum statutory obligation for the applicable
income and other employment taxes, and remitted the cash to the appropriate taxing authorities. the total shares withheld were approximately 2.3 million, 1.6 million and 1.8 million for 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively, and were
based on the value of the rsus on their respective vesting dates as determined by the companys closing stock price. total payments for the employees tax obligations to taxing authorities were $1.2 billion, $520 million and $406 million
in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively, and are reflected as a financing activity within the consolidated statements of cash flows. these net-share settlements had the effect of share repurchases by the company as they reduced and retired the
number of shares that would have otherwise been issued as a result of the vesting and did not represent an expense to the company.66

for 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively.share-based compensationshare-based compensation cost for rsus is measured based on the closing fair market value of the companys common stock on the date
of grant. share-based compensation cost for stock options and employee stock purchase plan rights (stock purchase rights) is estimated at the grant date and offering date, respectively, based on the fair-value as calculated by the bsm
option-pricing model. the bsm option-pricing model incorporates various assumptions including expected volatility, estimated expected life and interest rates. the company recognizes share-based compensation cost as expense on a straight-line
basis over the requisite service period.the company did not grant any stock options during 2012. the company granted 1,370
and 34,000 stock options during 2011 and 2010, respectively. the weighted-average grant date fair value per share of stock options granted during 2011 and 2010 was $181.13 and $108.58, respectively.during 2012 and 2010, in conjunction with certain business combinations, the company assumed 41,000 and 98,000 stock options,
respectively, which had a weighted-average fair value per share of $405.39 and $216.82, respectively. the company did not assume any stock options during 2011.the weighted-average fair value of stock purchase rights per share was $108.44, $71.47 and $45.03 during 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively.67

weighted-average period of 3.3 years.note 7  commitments and contingenciesaccrued warranty and indemnificationthe company offers a basic limited parts and labor warranty on its hardware products. the basic warranty period for hardware products is typically one year from the date of purchase by the end-user. the
company also offers a 90-day basic warranty for its service parts used to repair the companys hardware products. the company provides currently for the estimated cost that may be incurred under its basic limited product warranties at the time
related revenue is recognized. factors considered in determining appropriate accruals for product warranty obligations include the size of the installed base of products subject to warranty protection, historical and projected warranty claim rates,
historical and projected cost-per-claim, and knowledge of specific product failures that are outside of the companys typical experience. the company assesses the adequacy of its pre-existing warranty liabilities and adjusts the amounts as
necessary based on actual experience and changes in future estimates.the following table shows changes in the companys
accrued warranties and related costs for 2012, 2011, and 2010 (in millions):beginning accrued warranty and related costscost of warranty claimsaccruals for product warrantyending accrued warranty and related coststhe company generally does not indemnify end-users of its operating system and application software
against legal claims that the software infringes third-party intellectual property rights. other agreements entered into by the company sometimes include indemnification provisions under which the company could be subject to costs and/or damages in
the event of an infringement claim against the company or an indemnified third-party. however, the company has not been required to make any significant payments resulting from such an infringement claim asserted against it or an indemnified
third-party and, in the opinion of management, does not have a potential liability related to unresolved infringement claims subject to indemnification that would materially adversely affect its financial condition or operating results. therefore,
the company did not record a liability for infringement costs related to indemnification as of either september 29, 2012 or september 24, 2011.the company has entered into indemnification agreements with its directors and executive officers. under these agreements, the company has agreed to indemnify such individuals to the fullest extent
permitted by law against liabilities that arise by reason of their status as directors or officers and to advance expenses incurred by such68



individuals in connection with related legal proceedings. it is not possible to determine the maximum potential amount of payments the company could be required to make under these agreements due
to the limited history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each claim. however, the company maintains directors and officers liability insurance coverage to reduce its exposure to such obligations, and
payments made under these agreements historically have not been material.concentrations in the available sources of supply of materials
and productalthough most components essential to the companys business are generally available from multiple
sources, a number of components are currently obtained from single or limited sources, which subjects the company to significant supply and pricing risks. many components, including those that are available from multiple sources, are at times
subject to industry-wide shortages and significant commodity pricing fluctuations. in addition, the company has entered into various agreements for the supply of components; however there can be no guarantee that the company will be able to extend
or renew these agreements on similar terms, or at all. therefore, the company remains subject to significant risks of supply shortages and price increases that can materially adversely affect its financial condition and operating results.the company and other participants in the markets for mobile communication and media devices and personal computers also
compete for various components with other industries that have experienced increased demand for their products. the company also uses some custom components that are not common to the rest of these industries, and new products introduced by the
company often utilize custom components available from only one source. when a component or product uses new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers yields have matured or manufacturing capacity has increased.
if the companys supply of components for a new or existing product were delayed or constrained, or if an outsourcing partner delayed shipments of completed products to the company, the companys financial condition and operating results
could be materially adversely affected. the companys business and financial performance could also be materially adversely affected depending on the time required to obtain sufficient quantities from the original source, or to identify and
obtain sufficient quantities from an alternative source. continued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at all, may be affected if those suppliers concentrated on the production of common components instead of components
customized to meet the companys requirements.substantially all of the companys hardware products are
manufactured by outsourcing partners that are located primarily in asia. a significant concentration of this manufacturing is currently performed by a small number of outsourcing partners, often in single locations. certain of these outsourcing
partners are the sole-sourced suppliers of components and manufacturers for many of the companys products. although the company works closely with its outsourcing partners on manufacturing schedules, the companys operating results could
be adversely affected if its outsourcing partners were unable to meet their production commitments. the companys purchase commitments typically cover its requirements for periods up to 150 days.long-term supply agreementsthe company has entered into long-term agreements to secure the supply of certain inventory components. under certain of these agreements, which expire between 2012 and 2022, the company has made
prepayments for the future purchase of inventory components and has acquired capital equipment to use in the manufacturing of such components.as of september 29, 2012, the company had a total of $4.2 billion of inventory component prepayments outstanding, of which $1.2 billion are classified as other current assets and $3.0 billion are
classified as other assets in the consolidated balance sheets. the company had a total of $2.3 billion of inventory component prepayments outstanding as of september 24, 2011. the companys outstanding prepayments will be applied to
certain inventory component purchases made during the term of each respective agreement. the company utilized $943 million and $173 million of inventory component prepayments during 2012 and 2011, respectively.69

other off-balance sheet commitmentslease commitmentsthe company leases various equipment and facilities,
including retail space, under noncancelable operating lease arrangements. the company does not currently utilize any other off-balance sheet financing arrangements. the major facility leases are typically for terms not exceeding 10 years and
generally provide renewal options for terms not exceeding five additional years. leases for retail space are for terms ranging from five to 20 years, the majority of which are for 10 years, and often contain multi-year renewal options. as of
september 29, 2012, the companys total future minimum lease payments under noncancelable operating leases were $4.4 billion, of which $3.1 billion related to leases for retail space.rent expense under all operating leases, including both cancelable and noncancelable leases, was $488 million, $338 million and $271
million in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. future minimum lease payments under noncancelable operating leases having remaining terms in excess of one year as of september 29, 2012, are as follows (in millions):20132014201520162017thereaftertotal minimum lease paymentsother commitmentsas of september 29, 2012, the company had outstanding off-balance sheet third-party manufacturing commitments and component purchase commitments of $21.1 billion.in addition to the off-balance sheet commitments mentioned above, the company had outstanding obligations of $988 million as of
september 29, 2012, which were comprised mainly of commitments to acquire capital assets, including product tooling and manufacturing process equipment, and commitments related to advertising, research and development, internet and
telecommunications services and other obligations.contingenciesthe company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that have arisen in the ordinary course of business and have not been fully
adjudicated, certain of which are discussed in part i, item 3 of this form 10-k under the heading legal proceedings and in part i, item 1a of this form 10-k under the heading risk factors. in the opinion of
management, there was not at least a reasonable possibility the company may have incurred a material loss, or a material loss in excess of a recorded accrual, with respect to loss contingencies. however, the outcome of litigation is inherently
uncertain. therefore, although management considers the likelihood of such an outcome to be remote, if one or more of these legal matters were resolved against the company in a reporting period for amounts in excess of managements
expectations, the companys consolidated financial statements for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected.apple
inc. vs samsung electronics co., ltd, et al.on august 24, 2012, a jury returned a verdict awarding the company $1.05
billion in its lawsuit against samsung electronics and affiliated parties in the united states district court, northern district of california, san jose division. because the award is subject to entry of final judgment and may be subject to
appeal, the company has not recognized the award in its consolidated financial statements for the year ended september 29, 2012.70



note 8  segment information and geographic datathe company reports segment information based on the management approach. the management approach
designates the internal reporting used by management for making decisions and assessing performance as the source of the companys reportable segments.the company manages its business primarily on a geographic basis. accordingly, the company determined its reportable operating segments, which are generally based on the nature and location of its
customers, to be the americas, europe, japan, asia-pacific and retail. the results of the americas, europe, japan and asia-pacific segments do not include results of the retail segment. the americas segment includes both north and south america. the
europe segment includes european countries, as well as the middle east and africa. the asia-pacific segment includes australia and asian countries, other than japan. the retail segment operates apple retail stores in 13 countries, including the u.s.
each operating segment provides similar hardware and software products and similar services. the accounting policies of the various segments are the same as those described in note 1, summary of significant accounting policies.the company evaluates the performance of its operating segments based on net sales and operating income. net sales for
geographic segments are generally based on the location of customers, while retail segment net sales are based on sales from the companys retail stores. operating income for each segment includes net sales to third parties, related cost of
sales and operating expenses directly attributable to the segment. advertising expenses are generally included in the geographic segment in which the expenditures are incurred. operating income for each segment excludes other income and expense and
certain expenses managed outside the operating segments. costs excluded from segment operating income include various corporate expenses, such as manufacturing costs and variances not included in standard costs, research and development, corporate
marketing expenses, share-based compensation expense, income taxes, various nonrecurring charges, and other separately managed general and administrative costs. prior to 2012, the company allocated to corporate expenses certain costs associated with
its high-profile retail stores that have been designed and built to promote brand awareness and serve as vehicles for corporate sales and marketing activities. beginning in 2012, the company no longer allocates these costs to corporate expenses and
reclassified $102 million and $75 million of such costs from corporate to retail segment expenses for 2011 and 2010, respectively. the company does not include intercompany transfers between segments for management reporting purposes.segment assets include receivables and inventories, and for the retail segment also includes capital assets. segment assets exclude
corporate assets, such as cash and cash equivalents, short-term and long-term marketable securities, vendor non-trade receivables, other long-term investments, manufacturing and corporate facilities, product tooling and manufacturing process
equipment, miscellaneous corporate infrastructure, goodwill and other acquired intangible assets. except for the retail segment, capital asset purchases for long-lived assets are not reported to management by segment and therefore are excluded from
the geographic segment assets and instead included in corporate assets. cash payments for capital asset purchases by the retail segment were $858 million, $612 million and $392 million for 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. the companys total
depreciation and amortization was $3.3 billion, $1.8 billion and $1.0 billion in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively, of which $319 million, $273 million and $198 million was related to the retail segment in the respective years. depreciation and
amortization on segment assets included in the geographic segments was not significant.71

our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.we conducted our audits in
accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board (united states). those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. an audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. an audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as

report of ernst & young llp, independent registered public accounting firmthe board of directors and shareholders of apple inc.we have audited apple inc.s internal control over financial reporting as of september 29, 2012, based on criteria established in internal control  integrated framework issued by
the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission (the coso criteria). apple inc.s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the
effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying managements annual report on internal control over financial reporting. our responsibility is to express an opinion on the companys internal control
over financial reporting based on our audit.we conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the public company
accounting oversight board (united states). those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. our
audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk,
and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. we believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.a companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. a companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that,
in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance
regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. also, projections
of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.in our opinion, apple inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of
september 29, 2012, based on the coso criteria.we also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the public
company accounting oversight board (united states), the 2012 consolidated financial statements of apple inc. and our report dated october 31, 2012 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon./s/ ernst & young llpsan jose, californiaoctober 31, 201276



none.evaluation of
disclosure controls and proceduresbased on an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of the
companys management, the companys principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that the companys disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the exchange act
were effective as of september 29, 2012 to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by the company in reports that it files or submits under the exchange act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported
within the time periods specified in the securities and exchange commission rules and forms and (ii) accumulated and communicated to the companys management, including its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as
appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.inherent limitations over internal controlsthe companys internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of
financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles (gaap). the companys internal control over financial reporting includes those
policies and procedures that:pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the
companys assets;provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with gaap, and
that the companys receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of the companys management and directors; andprovide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets
that could have a material effect on the financial statements.management, including the companys
chief executive officer and chief financial officer, does not expect that the companys internal controls will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. a control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable,
not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs.
because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of internal controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. also, any evaluation of the effectiveness of

## Item 1A


In addition to an adverse impact on demand for the Company’s products, uncertainty about, or a decline in, global or regional economic conditions can have a significant impact on the Company’s suppliers, contract manufacturers, logistics providers, distributors, cellular network carriers and other channel partners. Potential effects include financial instability; inability to obtain credit to finance operations and purchases of the Company’s products; and insolvency.A downturn in the economic environment can also lead to increased credit and collectibility risk on the Company’s trade receivables; the failure of derivative counterparties and other financial institutions; limitations on the Company’s ability to issue new debt; reduced liquidity; and declines in the fair value of the Company’s financial instruments. These and other economic factors can materially adversely affect the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition.The Company’s business can be impacted by political events, trade and other international disputes, war, terrorism, natural disasters, public health issues, industrial accidents and other business interruptions.Political events, trade and other international disputes, war, terrorism, natural disasters, public health issues, industrial accidents and other business interruptions can harm or disrupt international commerce and the global economy, and could have a material adverse effect on the Company and its customers, suppliers, contract manufacturers, logistics providers, distributors, cellular network carriers and other channel partners.The Company has a large, global business, and the Company believes that it generally benefits from growth in international trade. Trade and other international disputes can result in tariffs, sanctions, and other measures that restrict international trade and can adversely affect the Company’s business. For example, tensions between the U.S. and China have led to a series of tariffs being imposed by the U.S. on imports from China mainland, as well as other business restrictions. Tariffs increase the cost of the Company’s products and the components and raw materials that go into making them. These increased costs adversely impact the gross margin that the Company earns on its products. Tariffs can also make the Company’s products more expensive for customers, which could make the Company’s products less competitive and reduce consumer demand. Countries may also adopt other measures, such as controls on imports or exports of goods, technology or data, that could adversely impact the Company’s operations and supply chain and limit the Company’s ability to offer its products and services as designed. These measures can require the Company to take various actions, including changing suppliers, restructuring business relationships, and ceasing to offer third-party applications on its platforms. Changing the Company’s operations in accordance with new or changed trade restrictions can be expensive, time-consuming, disruptive to the Company’s operations and distracting to management. Such restrictions can be announced with little or no advance notice and the Company may not be able to effectively mitigate all adverse impacts from such measures. Political uncertainty surrounding trade and other international disputes could also have a negative effect on consumer confidence and spending, which could adversely affect the Company’s business.Many of the Company’s operations and facilities, as well as critical business operations of the Company’s suppliers and contract manufacturers, are in locations that are prone to earthquakes and other natural disasters. In addition, such operations and facilities are subject to the risk of interruption by fire, power shortages, nuclear power plant accidents and other industrial accidents, terrorist attacks and other hostile acts, ransomware and other cybersecurity attacks, labor disputes, public health issues, including pandemics such as the COVID-19 pandemic, and other events beyond the Company’s control. Global climate change is resulting in certain types of natural disasters occurring more frequently or with more intense effects. Such events can make it difficult or impossible for the Company to manufacture and deliver products to its customers, create delays and inefficiencies in the Company’s supply and manufacturing chain, and result in slowdowns and outages to the Company’s service offerings. Following an interruption to its business, the Company can require substantial recovery time, experience significant expenditures to resume operations, and lose significant sales. Because the Company relies on single or limited sources for the supply and manufacture of many critical components, a business interruption affecting such sources would exacerbate any negative consequences to the Company.The Company’s operations are also subject to the risks of industrial accidents at its suppliers and contract manufacturers. While the Company’s suppliers are required to maintain safe working environments and operations, an industrial accident could occur and could result in disruption to the Company’s business and harm to the Company’s reputation. Major public health issues, including pandemics such as the COVID-19 pandemic, have adversely affected, and could in the future adversely affect, the Company due to their impact on the global economy and demand for consumer products; the imposition of protective public safety measures, such as stringent employee travel restrictions and limitations on freight services and the movement of products between regions; and disruptions in the Company’s supply chain and sales and distribution channels, resulting in interruptions of the supply of current products and delays in production ramps of new products.While the Company maintains insurance coverage for certain types of losses, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses that may arise.Apple Inc. | 2021 Form 10-K | 7



Global markets for the Company’s products and services are highly competitive and subject to rapid technological change, and the Company may be unable to compete effectively in these markets.The Company’s products and services are offered in highly competitive global markets characterized by aggressive price competition and resulting downward pressure on gross margins, frequent introduction of new products and services, short product life cycles, evolving industry standards, continual improvement in product price and performance characteristics, rapid adoption of technological advancements by competitors, and price sensitivity on the part of consumers and businesses.The Company’s ability to compete successfully depends heavily on ensuring the continuing and timely introduction of innovative new products, services and technologies to the marketplace. The Company designs and develops nearly the entire solution for its products, including the hardware, operating system, numerous software applications and related services. As a result, the Company must make significant investments in R&D. There can be no assurance these investments will achieve expected returns, and the Company may not be able to develop and market new products and services successfully.The Company currently holds a significant number of patents, trademarks and copyrights and has registered, and applied to register, additional patents, trademarks and copyrights. In contrast, many of the Company’s competitors seek to compete primarily through aggressive pricing and very low cost structures, and by imitating the Company’s products and infringing on its intellectual property. Effective intellectual property protection is not consistently available in every country in which the Company operates. If the Company is unable to continue to develop and sell innovative new products with attractive margins or if competitors infringe on the Company’s intellectual property, the Company’s ability to maintain a competitive advantage could be adversely affected.The Company has a minority market share in the global smartphone, personal computer and tablet markets. The Company faces substantial competition in these markets from companies that have significant technical, marketing, distribution and other resources, as well as established hardware, software and digital content supplier relationships. In addition, some of the Company’s competitors have broader product lines, lower-priced products and a larger installed base of active devices. Competition has been particularly intense as competitors have aggressively cut prices and lowered product margins. Certain competitors have the resources, experience or cost structures to provide products at little or no profit or even at a loss. Some of the markets in which the Company competes have from time to time experienced little to no growth or contracted overall.Additionally, the Company faces significant competition as competitors imitate the Company’s product features and applications within their products or collaborate to offer solutions that are more competitive than those they currently offer. The Company also expects competition to intensify as competitors imitate the Company’s approach to providing components seamlessly within their offerings or work collaboratively to offer integrated solutions.The Company’s services also face substantial competition, including from companies that have significant resources and experience and have established service offerings with large customer bases. The Company competes with business models that provide content to users for free. The Company also competes with illegitimate means to obtain third-party digital content and applications.The Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition depend substantially on the Company’s ability to continually improve its products and services to maintain their functional and design advantages. There can be no assurance the Company will be able to continue to provide products and services that compete effectively.Business RisksTo remain competitive and stimulate customer demand, the Company must successfully manage frequent introductions and transitions of products and services.Due to the highly volatile and competitive nature of the industries in which the Company competes, the Company must continually introduce new products, services and technologies, enhance existing products and services, effectively stimulate customer demand for new and upgraded products and services, and successfully manage the transition to these new and upgraded products and services. The success of new product and service introductions depends on a number of factors, including timely and successful development, market acceptance, the Company’s ability to manage the risks associated with production ramp-up issues, the availability of application software for the Company’s products, the effective management of purchase commitments and inventory levels in line with anticipated product demand, the availability of products in appropriate quantities and at expected costs to meet anticipated demand, and the risk that new products and services may have quality or other defects or deficiencies. There can be no assurance the Company will successfully manage future introductions and transitions of products and services.Apple Inc. | 2021 Form 10-K | 8



The Company depends on component and product manufacturing and logistical services provided by outsourcing partners, many of which are located outside of the U.S.Substantially all of the Company’s manufacturing is performed in whole or in part by outsourcing partners located primarily in Asia. A significant concentration of this manufacturing is currently performed by a small number of outsourcing partners, often in single locations. The Company has also outsourced much of its transportation and logistics management. While these arrangements can lower operating costs, they also reduce the Company’s direct control over production and distribution. Such diminished control has from time to time and may in the future have an adverse effect on the quality or quantity of products manufactured or services provided, or adversely affect the Company’s flexibility to respond to changing conditions. Although arrangements with these partners may contain provisions for product defect expense reimbursement, the Company generally remains responsible to the consumer for warranty and out-of-warranty service in the event of product defects and experiences an unanticipated product defect liability from time to time. While the Company relies on its partners to adhere to its supplier code of conduct, violations of the supplier code of conduct occur from time to time and can materially adversely affect the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.The Company relies on single-source outsourcing partners in the U.S., Asia and Europe to supply and manufacture many components, and on outsourcing partners primarily located in Asia, for final assembly of substantially all of the Company’s hardware products. Any failure of these partners to perform can have a negative impact on the Company’s cost or supply of components or finished goods. In addition, manufacturing or logistics in these locations or transit to final destinations can be disrupted for a variety of reasons, including natural and man-made disasters, information technology system failures, commercial disputes, military actions, economic, business, labor, environmental, public health or political issues, or international trade disputes.The Company has invested in manufacturing process equipment, much of which is held at certain of its outsourcing partners, and has made prepayments to certain of its suppliers associated with long-term supply agreements. While these arrangements help ensure the supply of components and finished goods, if these outsourcing partners or suppliers experience severe financial problems or other disruptions in their business, such continued supply can be reduced or terminated, and the recoverability of manufacturing process equipment or prepayments can be negatively impacted.Future operating results depend upon the Company’s ability to obtain components in sufficient quantities on commercially reasonable terms.Because the Company currently obtains certain components from single or limited sources, the Company is subject to significant supply and pricing risks. Many components, including those that are available from multiple sources, are at times subject to industry-wide shortages and significant commodity pricing fluctuations that can materially adversely affect the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition. For example, the global semiconductor industry is experiencing high demand and shortages of supply, which has adversely affected, and could materially adversely affect, the Company’s ability to obtain sufficient quantities of components and products on commercially reasonable terms or at all. While the Company has entered into agreements for the supply of many components, there can be no assurance the Company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms, or at all. Component suppliers may suffer from poor financial conditions, which can lead to business failure for the supplier or consolidation within a particular industry, further limiting the Company’s ability to obtain sufficient quantities of components on commercially reasonable terms or at all. The effects of global or regional economic conditions on the Company’s suppliers, described in “The Company’s operations and performance depend significantly on global and regional economic conditions and adverse economic conditions can materially adversely affect the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition,” above, can also affect the Company’s ability to obtain components. Therefore, the Company remains subject to significant risks of supply shortages and price increases that can materially adversely affect its business, results of operations and financial condition.The Company’s new products often utilize custom components available from only one source. When a component or product uses new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers’ yields have matured or their manufacturing capacities have increased. The continued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at all, can be affected for any number of reasons, including if suppliers decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the Company’s requirements. When the Company’s supply of components for a new or existing product has been delayed or constrained, or when an outsourcing partner has delayed shipments of completed products to the Company, the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition have been adversely affected and future delays or constraints could materially adversely affect the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition. The Company’s business and financial performance could also be materially adversely affected depending on the time required to obtain sufficient quantities from the source, or to identify and obtain sufficient quantities from an alternative source.Apple Inc. | 2021 Form 10-K | 9



The Company’s products and services may be affected from time to time by design and manufacturing defects that could materially adversely affect the Company’s business and result in harm to the Company’s reputation.The Company offers complex hardware and software products and services that can be affected by design and manufacturing defects. Sophisticated operating system software and applications, such as those offered by the Company, often have issues that can unexpectedly interfere with the intended operation of hardware or software products. Defects can also exist in components and products the Company purchases from third parties. Component defects could make the Company’s products unsafe and create a risk of environmental or property damage and personal injury. These risks may increase as the Company’s products are introduced into specialized applications, including healthcare. In addition, the Company’s service offerings can have quality issues and from time to time experience outages, service slowdowns or errors. As a result, the Company’s services from time to time have not performed as anticipated and may not meet customer expectations. There can be no assurance the Company will be able to detect and fix all issues and defects in the hardware, software and services it offers. Failure to do so can result in widespread technical and performance issues affecting the Company’s products and services. In addition, the Company can be exposed to product liability claims, recalls, product replacements or modifications, write-offs of inventory, property, plant and equipment, and/or intangible assets, and significant warranty and other expenses, including litigation costs and regulatory fines. Quality problems can also adversely affect the experience for users of the Company’s products and services, and result in harm to the Company’s reputation, loss of competitive advantage, poor market acceptance, reduced demand for products and services, delay in new product and service introductions and lost sales.The Company is exposed to the risk of write-downs on the value of its inventory and other assets, in addition to purchase commitment cancellation risk.The Company records a write-down for product and component inventories that have become obsolete or exceed anticipated demand, or for which cost exceeds net realizable value. The Company also accrues necessary cancellation fee reserves for orders of excess products and components. The Company reviews long-lived assets, including capital assets held at its suppliers’ facilities and inventory prepayments, for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate the assets may not be recoverable. If the Company determines that an impairment has occurred, it records a write-down equal to the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value. Although the Company believes its inventory, capital assets, inventory prepayments and other assets and purchase commitments are currently recoverable, there can be no assurance the Company will not incur write-downs, fees, impairments and other charges given the rapid and unpredictable pace of product obsolescence in the industries in which the Company competes.The Company orders components for its products and builds inventory in advance of product announcements and shipments. Manufacturing purchase obligations cover the Company’s forecasted component and manufacturing requirements, typically for periods up to 150 days. Because the Company’s markets are volatile, competitive and subject to rapid technology and price changes, there is a risk the Company will forecast incorrectly and order or produce excess or insufficient amounts of components or products, or not fully utilize firm purchase commitments.The Company relies on access to third-party intellectual property, which may not be available to the Company on commercially reasonable terms or at all.The Company’s products and services are designed to include intellectual property owned by third parties, which requires licenses from those third parties. In addition, because of technological changes in the industries in which the Company currently competes or in the future may compete, current extensive patent coverage and the rapid rate of issuance of new patents, the Company’s products and services may unknowingly infringe existing patents or intellectual property rights of others. From time to time, the Company has been notified that it may be infringing certain patents or other intellectual property rights of third parties. Based on experience and industry practice, the Company believes licenses to such third-party intellectual property can generally be obtained on commercially reasonable terms. However, there can be no assurance the necessary licenses can be obtained on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Failure to obtain the right to use third-party intellectual property, or to use such intellectual property on commercially reasonable terms, can preclude the Company from selling certain products or services, or otherwise have a material adverse impact on the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition.The Company’s future performance depends in part on support from third-party software developers.The Company believes decisions by customers to purchase its hardware products depend in part on the availability of third-party software applications and services. There can be no assurance third-party developers will continue to develop and maintain software applications and services for the Company’s products. If third-party software applications and services cease to be developed and maintained for the Company’s products, customers may choose not to buy the Company’s products.The Company believes the availability of third-party software applications and services for its products depends in part on the developers’ perception and analysis of the relative benefits of developing, maintaining and upgrading such software and services for the Company’s products compared to competitors’ platforms, such as Android for smartphones and tablets, Windows for personal computers and tablets, and PlayStation, Nintendo and Xbox for gaming platforms. This analysis may be based on factors such as the market position of the Company and its products, the anticipated revenue that may be generated, expected future growth of product sales, and the costs of developing such applications and services.Apple Inc. | 2021 Form 10-K | 10



The Company’s minority market share in the global smartphone, personal computer and tablet markets can make developers less inclined to develop or upgrade software for the Company’s products and more inclined to devote their resources to developing and upgrading software for competitors’ products with larger market share. When developers focus their efforts on these competing platforms, the availability and quality of applications for the Company’s devices can suffer.The Company relies on the continued availability and development of compelling and innovative software applications for its products. The Company’s products and operating systems are subject to rapid technological change, and when third-party developers are unable to or choose not to keep up with this pace of change, their applications can fail to take advantage of these changes to deliver improved customer experiences and can operate incorrectly and can result in dissatisfied customers.The Company distributes third-party applications for its products through the App Store. For the vast majority of applications, developers keep all of the revenue they generate on the App Store. The Company only retains a commission from sales of applications and sales of digital services or goods within an application. From time to time, the Company has made changes to its App Store, including actions taken in response to competition, market and legal conditions. The Company may make further business changes in the future. New legislative initiatives, such as the proposed European Union (“EU”) Digital Markets Act, could, if enacted, require further changes. The Company is also subject to litigation and investigations relating to the App Store, which have resulted in changes to the Company’s business practices, and may in the future result in further changes. These changes could include how and to what extent the Company charges developers for access to its platforms and manages distribution of apps outside of the App Store. This could reduce the volume of sales, and the commission that the Company earns on those sales, would decrease. If the rate of the commission that the Company retains on such sales is reduced, or if it is otherwise narrowed in scope or eliminated, the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.Failure to obtain or create digital content that appeals to the Company’s customers, or to make such content available on commercially reasonable terms, could have a material adverse impact on the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition.The Company contracts with numerous third parties to offer their digital content to customers. This includes the right to sell, or offer subscriptions to, third-party content, as well as the right to incorporate specific content into the Company’s own services. The licensing or other distribution arrangements for this content can be for relatively short time periods and do not guarantee the continuation or renewal of these arrangements on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Some third-party content providers and distributors currently or in the future may offer competing products and services, and can take actions to make it difficult or impossible for the Company to license or otherwise distribute their content. Other content owners, providers or distributors may seek to limit the Company’s access to, or increase the cost of, such content. The Company may be unable to continue to offer a wide variety of content at commercially reasonable prices with acceptable usage rules.The Company also produces its own digital content, which can be costly to produce due to intense and increasing competition for talent, content and subscribers, and may fail to appeal to the Company’s customers. The COVID-19 pandemic has also caused additional restrictions on production and increased costs for digital content.Some third-party digital content providers require the Company to provide digital rights management and other security solutions. If requirements change, the Company may have to develop or license new technology to provide these solutions. There can be no assurance the Company will be able to develop or license such solutions at a reasonable cost and in a timely manner.The Company’s success depends largely on the continued service and availability of highly skilled employees, including key personnel.Much of the Company’s future success depends on the continued availability and service of key personnel, including its Chief Executive Officer, executive team and other highly skilled employees. Experienced personnel in the technology industry are in high demand and competition for their talents is intense, especially in Silicon Valley, where most of the Company’s key personnel are located. The Company believes that its distinctive and inclusive culture is a significant driver of its success. If the Company is unable to nurture and maintain its culture, it could adversely affect the Company’s ability to recruit and retain highly skilled employees and materially adversely affect the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition.The Company depends on the performance of carriers, wholesalers, retailers and other resellers.The Company distributes its products through cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers and resellers, many of whom distribute products from competing manufacturers. The Company also sells its products and resells third-party products in most of its major markets directly to consumers, small and mid-sized businesses, and education, enterprise and government customers through its retail and online stores and its direct sales force.Some carriers providing cellular network service for the Company’s products offer financing, installment payment plans or subsidies for users’ purchases of the device. There can be no assurance such offers will be continued at all or in the same amounts.Apple Inc. | 2021 Form 10-K | 11



The Company has invested and will continue to invest in programs to enhance reseller sales, including staffing selected resellers’ stores with Company employees and contractors, and improving product placement displays. These programs can require a substantial investment while not assuring return or incremental sales. The financial condition of these resellers could weaken, these resellers could stop distributing the Company’s products, or uncertainty regarding demand for some or all of the Company’s products could cause resellers to reduce their ordering and marketing of the Company’s products.The Company’s business and reputation are impacted by information technology system failures and network disruptions.The Company and its global supply chain are exposed to information technology system failures or network disruptions caused by natural disasters, accidents, power disruptions, telecommunications failures, acts of terrorism or war, computer viruses, physical or electronic break-ins, ransomware or other cybersecurity incidents, or other events or disruptions. System redundancy and other continuity measures may be ineffective or inadequate, and the Company’s or its vendors’ business continuity and disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities. Such failures or disruptions can adversely impact the Company’s business by, among other things, preventing access to the Company’s online services, interfering with customer transactions or impeding the manufacturing and shipping of the Company’s products. These events could materially adversely affect the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.Losses or unauthorized access to or releases of confidential information, including personal information, could subject the Company to significant reputational, financial, legal and operational consequences.The Company’s business requires it to use and store confidential information, including personal information, with respect to the Company’s customers and employees. The Company devotes significant resources to network and data security, including through the use of encryption and other security measures intended to protect its systems and data. But these measures cannot provide absolute security, and losses or unauthorized access to or releases of confidential information occur and could materially adversely affect the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.The Company’s business also requires it to share confidential information with suppliers and other third parties. The Company relies on global suppliers that are also exposed to ransomware and other malicious attacks that can disrupt business operations. Although the Company takes steps to secure confidential information that is provided to or accessible by third parties working on the Company’s behalf, such measures are not always effective and losses or unauthorized access to or releases of confidential information occur. Such incidents and other malicious attacks could materially adversely affect the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.The Company experiences malicious attacks and other attempts to gain unauthorized access to its systems on a regular basis. These attacks seek to compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of confidential information or disrupt normal business operations, and could, among other things, impair the Company’s ability to attract and retain customers for its products and services, impact the price of the Company’s stock, materially damage commercial relationships, and expose the Company to litigation or government investigations, which could result in penalties, fines or judgments against the Company. Globally, attacks are expected to continue accelerating in both frequency and sophistication with increasing use by actors of tools and techniques that are designed to circumvent controls, avoid detection, and remove or obfuscate forensic evidence, all of which hinders the Company’s ability to identify, investigate and recover from incidents.Although malicious attacks perpetrated to gain access to confidential information, including personal information, affect many companies across various industries, the Company is at a relatively greater risk of being targeted because of its high profile and the value of the confidential information it creates, owns, manages, stores and processes.The Company has implemented systems and processes intended to secure its information technology systems and prevent unauthorized access to or loss of sensitive data, and mitigate the impact of unauthorized access, including through the use of encryption and authentication technologies. As with all companies, these security measures may not be sufficient for all eventualities and may be vulnerable to hacking, ransomware attacks, employee error, malfeasance, system error, faulty password management or other irregularities. For example, third parties can fraudulently induce the Company’s or its vendors’ employees or customers into disclosing user names, passwords or other sensitive information, which can, in turn, be used for unauthorized access to the Company’s or its vendors’ systems and services. To help protect customers and the Company, the Company deploys and makes available technologies like multifactor authentication, monitors its services and systems for unusual activity and may freeze accounts under suspicious circumstances, which, among other things, can result in the delay or loss of customer orders or impede customer access to the Company’s products and services.While the Company maintains insurance coverage that is intended to address certain aspects of data security risks, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise.Apple Inc. | 2021 Form 10-K | 12



Investment in new business strategies and acquisitions could disrupt the Company’s ongoing business, present risks not originally contemplated and adversely affect the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.The Company has invested, and in the future may invest, in new business strategies or acquisitions. Such endeavors may involve significant risks and uncertainties, including distraction of management from current operations, greater-than-expected liabilities and expenses, economic, political, legal and regulatory challenges associated with operating in new businesses, regions or countries, inadequate return on capital, potential impairment of tangible and intangible assets, and significant write-offs. Investment and acquisition transactions are exposed to additional risks, including failing to obtain required regulatory approvals on a timely basis or at all, or the imposition of onerous conditions that could delay or prevent the Company from completing a transaction or otherwise limit the Company’s ability to fully realize the anticipated benefits of a transaction. These new ventures are inherently risky and may not be successful. The failure of any significant investment could adversely affect the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.The Company’s retail stores have required and will continue to require a substantial investment and commitment of resources and are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties.The Company’s retail stores have required substantial investment in equipment and leasehold improvements, information systems, inventory and personnel. The Company also has entered into substantial lease commitments for retail space. Certain stores have been designed and built to serve as high-profile venues to promote brand awareness. Because of their unique design elements, locations and size, these stores require substantially more investment than the Company’s more typical retail stores. Due to the high cost structure associated with the Company’s retail stores, a decline in sales or the closure or poor performance of an individual store or multiple stores, including as a result of protective public safety measures in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, could result in significant lease termination costs, write-offs of equipment and leasehold improvements and severance costs.The Company’s retail operations are subject to many factors that pose risks and uncertainties and could adversely impact the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition, including macro-economic factors that could have an adverse effect on general retail activity. Other factors include the Company’s ability to: manage costs associated with retail store construction and operation; manage relationships with existing retail partners; manage costs associated with fluctuations in the value of retail inventory; and obtain and renew leases in quality retail locations at a reasonable cost.Legal and Regulatory Compliance RisksThe Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely impacted by unfavorable results of legal proceedings or government investigations.The Company is subject to various claims, legal proceedings and government investigations that have arisen in the ordinary course of business and have not yet been fully resolved, and new matters may arise in the future. In addition, agreements entered into by the Company sometimes include indemnification provisions which can subject the Company to costs and damages in the event of a claim against an indemnified third party. The number of claims, legal proceedings and government investigations involving the Company, and the alleged magnitude of such claims, proceedings and government investigations, has generally increased over time and may continue to increase.The Company has faced and continues to face a significant number of patent claims relating to its cellular-enabled products, and new claims may arise in the future. For example, technology and other patent-holding companies frequently assert their patents and seek royalties and often enter into litigation based on allegations of patent infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. The Company is vigorously defending infringement actions in courts in several U.S. jurisdictions, as well as internationally in various countries. The plaintiffs in these actions frequently seek injunctions and substantial damages.Regardless of the merit of particular claims, defending against litigation or responding to government investigations can be expensive, time-consuming, disruptive to the Company’s operations and distracting to management. In recognition of these considerations, the Company may enter into agreements or other arrangements to settle litigation and resolve such challenges. There can be no assurance such agreements can be obtained on acceptable terms or that litigation will not occur. These agreements can also significantly increase the Company’s cost of sales and operating expenses and require the Company to change its business practices and limit the Company’s ability to offer certain products and services.Except as described in Part I, Item 3 of this Form 10-K under the heading “Legal Proceedings” and in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Note 10, “Commitments and Contingencies” under the heading “Contingencies,” in the opinion of management, there was not at least a reasonable possibility the Company may have incurred a material loss, or a material loss greater than a recorded accrual, concerning loss contingencies for asserted legal and other claims.Apple Inc. | 2021 Form 10-K | 13



The outcome of litigation or government investigations is inherently uncertain. If one or more legal matters were resolved against the Company or an indemnified third party in a reporting period for amounts above management’s expectations, the Company’s results of operations and financial condition for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected. Further, such an outcome can result in significant compensatory, punitive or trebled monetary damages, disgorgement of revenue or profits, remedial corporate measures or injunctive relief against the Company, and can require the Company to change its business practices and limit the Company’s ability to offer certain products and services, all of which could materially adversely affect the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition.While the Company maintains insurance coverage for certain types of claims, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise.The Company is subject to complex and changing laws and regulations worldwide, which exposes the Company to potential liabilities, increased costs and other adverse effects on the Company’s business.The Company’s global operations are subject to complex and changing laws and regulations on subjects, including antitrust; privacy, data security and data localization; consumer protection; advertising, sales, billing and e-commerce; product liability; intellectual property ownership and infringement; digital platforms; Internet, telecommunications, and mobile communications; media, television, film and digital content; availability of third-party software applications and services; labor and employment; anticorruption; import, export and trade; foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions; anti–money laundering; foreign ownership and investment; tax; and environmental, health and safety, including electronic waste, recycling, and climate change.Compliance with these laws and regulations is onerous and expensive, increasing the cost of conducting the Company’s global operations. Changes to laws and regulations can adversely affect the Company’s business by increasing the Company’s costs, limiting the Company’s ability to offer a product or service to customers, requiring changes to the Company’s supply chain and business practices or otherwise making the Company’s products and services less attractive to customers. The Company has implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations, but there can be no assurance the Company’s employees, contractors or agents will not violate such laws and regulations or the Company’s policies and procedures. If the Company is found to have violated laws and regulations, it could materially adversely affect the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition. Regulatory changes and other actions that materially adversely affect the Company’s business may be announced with little or no advance notice and the Company may not be able to effectively mitigate all adverse impacts from such measures.The technology industry, including, in some instances, the Company, is subject to intense media, political and regulatory scrutiny, which exposes the Company to increasing regulation, government investigations, legal actions and penalties. From time to time, the Company has made changes to its App Store, including actions taken in response to competition, market and legal conditions. The Company may make further business changes in the future. New legislative initiatives, such as the proposed EU Digital Markets Act, could, if enacted, require further changes. These changes could include how and to what extent the Company charges developers for access to its platforms and manages distribution of apps outside of the App Store.The Company is also currently subject to antitrust investigations in various jurisdictions around the world, which can result in legal proceedings and claims against the Company that could, individually or in the aggregate, have a materially adverse impact on the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition. For example, the Company is the subject of investigations in Europe and other jurisdictions relating to App Store terms and conditions. If such investigations result in adverse findings against the Company, the Company could be exposed to significant fines and may be required to make changes to its App Store business, all of which could materially adversely affect the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition. The Company is also subject to litigation relating to the App Store, which has resulted in changes to the Company’s business practices, and may in the future result in further changes.Further, the Company has commercial relationships with other companies in the technology industry that are or may become subject to investigations and litigation that, if resolved against those other companies, could adversely affect the Company’s commercial relationships with those business partners and materially adversely affect the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition. For example, the Company earns revenue from licensing arrangements with other companies to offer their search services on the Company’s platforms and apps, and certain of these arrangements are currently subject to government investigations and legal proceedings.There can be no assurance the Company’s business will not be materially adversely affected, individually or in the aggregate, by the outcomes of such investigations, litigation or changes to laws and regulations in the future. Changes to the Company’s business practices to comply with new laws and regulations or in connection with other legal proceedings could negatively impact the reputation of the Company’s products for privacy and security and otherwise adversely affect the experience for users of the Company’s products and services, and result in harm to the Company’s reputation, loss of competitive advantage, poor market acceptance, reduced demand for products and services, and lost sales.Apple Inc. | 2021 Form 10-K | 14



The Company’s business is subject to a variety of U.S. and international laws, rules, policies and other obligations regarding data protection.The Company is subject to federal, state and international laws relating to the collection, use, retention, security and transfer of various types of personal information. In many cases, these laws apply not only to third-party transactions, but also restrict transfers of personal information among the Company and its international subsidiaries. Several jurisdictions have passed laws in this area, and additional jurisdictions are considering imposing additional restrictions or have laws that are pending. These laws continue to develop and may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Complying with emerging and changing requirements causes the Company to incur substantial costs and has required and may in the future require the Company to change its business practices. Noncompliance could result in significant penalties or legal liability.The Company makes statements about its use and disclosure of personal information through its privacy policy, information provided on its website, press statements and other privacy notices provided to customers. Any failure by the Company to comply with these public statements or with other federal, state or international privacy or data protection laws and regulations could result in inquiries or proceedings against the Company by governmental entities or others. In addition to reputational impacts, penalties could include ongoing audit requirements and significant legal liability.In addition to the risks generally relating to the collection, use, retention, security and transfer of personal information, the Company is also subject to specific obligations relating to information considered sensitive under applicable laws, such as health data, financial data and biometric data. Health data is subject to additional privacy, security and breach notification requirements, and the Company is subject to audit by governmental authorities regarding the Company’s compliance with these obligations. If the Company fails to adequately comply with these rules and requirements, or if health data is handled in a manner not permitted by law or under the Company’s agreements with healthcare institutions, the Company can be subject to litigation or government investigations, and can be liable for associated investigatory expenses, and can also incur significant fees or fines.Financial data, such as payment card data, is also subject to additional requirements. Under payment card rules and obligations, if cardholder information is potentially compromised, the Company can be liable for associated investigatory expenses and can also incur significant fees or fines if the Company fails to follow payment card industry data security standards. The Company could also experience a significant increase in payment card transaction costs or lose the ability to process payment cards if it fails to follow payment card industry data security standards, which would materially adversely affect the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.Financial RisksThe Company expects its quarterly net sales and results of operations to fluctuate.The Company’s profit margins vary across its products, services, geographic segments and distribution channels. For example, the gross margins on the Company’s products and services vary significantly and can change over time. The Company’s gross margins are subject to volatility and downward pressure due to a variety of factors, including: continued industry-wide global product pricing pressures and product pricing actions that the Company may take in response to such pressures; increased competition; the Company’s ability to effectively stimulate demand for certain of its products and services; compressed product life cycles; potential increases in the cost of components, outside manufacturing services, and developing, acquiring and delivering content for the Company’s services; the Company’s ability to manage product quality and warranty costs effectively; shifts in the mix of products and services, or in the geographic, currency or channel mix, including to the extent that regulatory changes require the Company to modify its product and service offerings; fluctuations in foreign exchange rates; and the introduction of new products or services, including new products or services with higher cost structures. These and other factors could have a materially adverse impact on the Company’s results of operations and financial condition.The Company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its fiscal year due in part to seasonal holiday demand. Additionally, new product and service introductions can significantly impact net sales, cost of sales and operating expenses. Further, the Company generates a significant portion of its net sales from a single product and a decline in demand for that product could significantly impact quarterly net sales. The Company could also be subject to unexpected developments, such as lower-than-anticipated demand for the Company’s products or services, issues with new product or service introductions, information technology system failures or network disruptions, or failure of one of the Company’s logistics, components supply, or manufacturing partners.The Company’s financial performance is subject to risks associated with changes in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to local currencies.The Company’s primary exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates relates to non–U.S. dollar–denominated sales, cost of sales and operating expenses worldwide. Gross margins on the Company’s products in foreign countries and on products that include components obtained from foreign suppliers could be materially adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.Apple Inc. | 2021 Form 10-K | 15



The weakening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar adversely affects the U.S. dollar value of the Company’s foreign currency–denominated sales and earnings, and generally leads the Company to raise international pricing, potentially reducing demand for the Company’s products. In some circumstances, for competitive or other reasons, the Company may decide not to raise international pricing to offset the U.S. dollar’s strengthening, which would adversely affect the U.S. dollar value of the gross margins the Company earns on foreign currency–denominated sales.Conversely, a strengthening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, while generally beneficial to the Company’s foreign currency–denominated sales and earnings, could cause the Company to reduce international pricing and incur losses on its foreign currency derivative instruments, thereby limiting the benefit. Additionally, strengthening of foreign currencies may increase the Company’s cost of product components denominated in those currencies, thus adversely affecting gross margins.The Company uses derivative instruments, such as foreign currency forward and option contracts, to hedge certain exposures to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. The use of such hedging activities may not be effective to offset any, or more than a portion, of the adverse financial effects of unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates over the limited time the hedges are in place.The Company is exposed to credit risk and fluctuations in the values of its investment portfolio.The Company’s investments can be negatively affected by changes in liquidity, credit deterioration, financial results, market and economic conditions, political risk, sovereign risk, interest rate fluctuations or other factors. As a result, the value and liquidity of the Company’s cash, cash equivalents, and marketable and non-marketable securities may fluctuate substantially. Therefore, although the Company has not realized any significant losses on its cash, cash equivalents, and marketable and non-marketable securities, future fluctuations in their value could result in significant losses and could have a material adverse impact on the Company’s results of operations and financial condition.The Company is exposed to credit risk on its trade accounts receivable, vendor non-trade receivables and prepayments related to long-term supply agreements, and this risk is heightened during periods when economic conditions worsen.The Company distributes its products through third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers and resellers. The Company also sells its products directly to small and mid-sized businesses and education, enterprise and government customers. A substantial majority of the Company’s outstanding trade receivables are not covered by collateral, third-party bank support or financing arrangements, or credit insurance, and a significant portion of the Company’s trade receivables can be concentrated within cellular network carriers or other resellers. The Company’s exposure to credit and collectibility risk on its trade receivables is higher in certain international markets and its ability to mitigate such risks may be limited. The Company also has unsecured vendor non-trade receivables resulting from purchases of components by outsourcing partners and other vendors that manufacture subassemblies or assemble final products for the Company. In addition, the Company has made prepayments associated with long-term supply agreements to secure supply of inventory components. As of September 25, 2021, the Company’s vendor non-trade receivables and prepayments related to long-term supply agreements were concentrated among a few individual vendors located primarily in Asia. While the Company has procedures to monitor and limit exposure to credit risk on its trade and vendor non-trade receivables, as well as long-term prepayments, there can be no assurance such procedures will effectively limit its credit risk and avoid losses.The Company is subject to changes in tax rates, the adoption of new U.S. or international tax legislation and exposure to additional tax liabilities.The Company is subject to taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions, including Ireland, where a number of the Company’s subsidiaries are organized. Due to economic and political conditions, tax laws and tax rates for income taxes and other non-income taxes in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change. The Company’s effective tax rates are affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, the introduction of new taxes, or changes in tax laws or their interpretation, including in the U.S. and Ireland.The Company is also subject to the examination of its tax returns and other tax matters by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities and governmental bodies. The Company regularly assesses the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of its provision for taxes. There can be no assurance as to the outcome of these examinations. If the Company’s effective tax rates were to increase, particularly in the U.S. or Ireland, or if the ultimate determination of the Company’s taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued, the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.Apple Inc. | 2021 Form 10-K | 16

Segment Operating PerformanceThe Company manages its business primarily on a geographic basis. The Company’s reportable segments consist of the Americas, Europe, Greater China, Japan and Rest of Asia Pacific. Americas includes both North and South America. Europe includes European countries, as well as India, the Middle East and Africa. Greater China includes China mainland, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Rest of Asia Pacific includes Australia and those Asian countries not included in the Company’s other reportable segments. Although the reportable segments provide similar hardware and software products and similar services, each one is managed separately to better align with the location of the Company’s customers and distribution partners and the unique market dynamics of each geographic region. Further information regarding the Company’s reportable segments can be found in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Note 11, “Segment Information and Geographic Data.”The following table shows net sales by reportable segment for 2021, 2020 and 2019 (dollars in millions):AmericasAmericas net sales increased during 2021 compared to 2020 due primarily to higher net sales of iPhone, Services and Mac.EuropeEurope net sales increased during 2021 compared to 2020 due primarily to higher net sales of iPhone, Services and iPad.

Gross MarginProducts and Services gross margin and gross margin percentage for 2021, 2020 and 2019 were as follows (dollars in millions):Products Gross MarginProducts gross margin increased during 2021 compared to 2020 due primarily to higher Products volume, a different Products mix and the strength in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar. Products gross margin percentage increased during 2021 compared to 2020 due primarily to a different Products mix, improved leverage and the strength in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar.Services Gross MarginServices gross margin increased during 2021 compared to 2020 due primarily to higher Services net sales and a different Services mix. Services gross margin percentage increased during 2021 compared to 2020 due primarily to a different Services mix and improved leverage, partially offset by higher Services costs.The Company’s future gross margins can be impacted by a variety of factors, as discussed in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K under the heading “Risk Factors.” As a result, the Company believes, in general, gross margins will be subject to volatility and downward pressure.Operating ExpensesOperating expenses for 2021, 2020 and 2019 were as follows (dollars in millions):Research and DevelopmentThe year-over-year growth in R&D expense in 2021 was driven primarily by increases in headcount-related expenses, R&D-related professional services and infrastructure-related costs. The Company continues to believe that focused investments in R&D are critical to its future growth and competitive position in the marketplace, and to the development of new and updated products and services that are central to the Company’s core business strategy.Selling, General and AdministrativeThe year-over-year growth in selling, general and administrative expense in 2021 was driven primarily by increases in headcount-related expenses, variable selling expenses and professional services.Apple Inc. | 2021 Form 10-K | 23

Other Income/(Expense), NetOther income/(expense), net (“OI&E”) for 2021, 2020 and 2019 was as follows (dollars in millions):The year-over-year decrease in OI&E during 2021 was due primarily to lower interest income and net losses on marketable securities, partially offset by positive fair value adjustments on non-marketable securities and lower interest expense on term debt.Provision for Income TaxesProvision for income taxes, effective tax rate and statutory federal income tax rate for 2021, 2020 and 2019 were as follows (dollars in millions):The Company’s effective tax rate for 2021 was lower than the statutory federal income tax rate due primarily to a lower effective tax rate on foreign earnings, tax benefits from share-based compensation and foreign-derived intangible income deductions. The Company’s effective tax rate for 2020 was lower than the statutory federal income tax rate due primarily to the lower tax rate on foreign earnings, including the impact of tax settlements, and tax benefits from share-based compensation.The Company’s effective tax rate for 2021 was lower compared to 2020 due primarily to higher tax benefits from foreign-derived intangible income deductions and share-based compensation and the favorable impact of changes in unrecognized tax benefits, partially offset by a one-time adjustment in 2020 of U.S. foreign tax credits in response to regulations issued by the U.S. Department of the Treasury in December 2019.During 2021, the Company established deferred tax assets (“DTAs”) for foreign tax credit carryforwards in Ireland and increased DTAs for R&D tax credit carryforwards in California, which resulted in a combined $3.5 billion increase in the valuation allowance on the Company’s DTAs, with no effect on net income. Management believes it is more likely than not that forecasted income, together with future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, will be sufficient to realize substantially all of the Company’s remaining DTAs.Liquidity and Capital ResourcesThe Company believes its balances of cash, cash equivalents and unrestricted marketable securities, which totaled $172.6 billion as of September 25, 2021, along with cash generated by ongoing operations and continued access to debt markets, will be sufficient to satisfy its cash requirements and capital return program over the next 12 months and beyond.The Company’s material cash requirements include the following contractual and other obligations.DebtAs of September 25, 2021, the Company had outstanding floating- and fixed-rate notes with varying maturities for an aggregate principal amount of $118.1 billion (collectively the “Notes”), with $9.6 billion payable within 12 months. Future interest payments associated with the Notes total $39.5 billion, with $2.9 billion payable within 12 months.The Company also issues unsecured short-term promissory notes (“Commercial Paper”) pursuant to a commercial paper program. As of September 25, 2021, the Company had $6.0 billion of Commercial Paper outstanding, all of which was payable within 12 months.Apple Inc. | 2021 Form 10-K | 24



LeasesThe Company has lease arrangements for certain equipment and facilities, including retail, corporate, manufacturing and data center space. As of September 25, 2021, the Company had fixed lease payment obligations of $14.6 billion, with $1.8 billion payable within 12 months.Manufacturing Purchase ObligationsThe Company utilizes several outsourcing partners to manufacture subassemblies for the Company’s products and to perform final assembly and testing of finished products. The Company also obtains individual components for its products from a wide variety of individual suppliers. Outsourcing partners acquire components and build product based on demand information supplied by the Company, which typically covers periods up to 150 days. As of September 25, 2021, the Company had manufacturing purchase obligations of $54.8 billion, with $54.7 billion payable within 12 months. The Company’s manufacturing purchase obligations are primarily noncancelable.Other Purchase ObligationsThe Company’s other purchase obligations primarily consist of noncancelable obligations to acquire capital assets, including product tooling and manufacturing process equipment, and noncancelable obligations related to advertising, content creation and Internet and telecommunications services. As of September 25, 2021, the Company had other purchase obligations of $8.3 billion, with $4.8 billion payable within 12 months.Deemed Repatriation Tax PayableAs of September 25, 2021, the balance of the deemed repatriation tax payable imposed by the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the “Act”) was $24.6 billion, none of which is payable within 12 months.In addition to its cash requirements, the Company has a capital return program authorized by the Board of Directors. The Program does not obligate the Company to acquire any specific number of shares. As of September 25, 2021, the Company’s quarterly cash dividend was $0.22 per share. The Company intends to increase its dividend on an annual basis, subject to declaration by the Board of Directors.Critical Accounting EstimatesThe preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) and the Company’s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and operating results require the Company’s management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported. Note 1, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Company’s consolidated financial statements. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities.Uncertain Tax PositionsThe Company is subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. The evaluation of the Company’s uncertain tax positions involves significant judgment in the interpretation and application of GAAP and complex domestic and international tax laws, including the Act and matters related to the allocation of international taxation rights between countries. Although management believes the Company’s reserves are reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different from that which is reflected in the Company’s reserves. Reserves are adjusted considering changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax examination or the refinement of an estimate. Resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with management’s expectations could have a material impact on the Company’s financial condition and operating results.Legal and Other ContingenciesThe Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business, the outcomes of which are inherently uncertain. The Company records a liability when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable, the determination of which requires significant judgment. Resolution of legal matters in a manner inconsistent with management’s expectations could have a material impact on the Company’s financial condition and operating results.Apple Inc. | 2021 Form 10-K | 25


## Item 7A


To provide an assessment of the foreign currency risk associated with certain of the Company’s foreign currency derivative positions, the Company performed a sensitivity analysis using a value-at-risk (“VAR”) model to assess the potential impact of fluctuations in exchange rates. The VAR model consisted of using a Monte Carlo simulation to generate thousands of random market price paths assuming normal market conditions. The VAR is the maximum expected loss in fair value, for a given confidence interval, to the Company’s foreign currency derivative positions due to adverse movements in rates. The VAR model is not intended to represent actual losses but is used as a risk estimation and management tool. Forecasted transactions, firm commitments and assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies were excluded from the model. Based on the results of the model, the Company estimates with 95% confidence, a maximum one-day loss in fair value of $550 million as of September 25, 2021, compared to a maximum one-day loss in fair value of $551 million as of September 26, 2020. Because the Company uses foreign currency instruments for hedging purposes, the losses in fair value incurred on those instruments are generally offset by increases in the fair value of the underlying exposures.Actual future gains and losses associated with the Company’s investment portfolio, debt and derivative positions may differ materially from the sensitivity analyses performed as of September 25, 2021 due to the inherent limitations associated with predicting the timing and amount of changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and the Company’s actual exposures and positions.Apple Inc. | 2021 Form 10-K | 27

Apple Inc.Notes to Consolidated Financial StatementsNote 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting PoliciesBasis of Presentation and PreparationThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Apple Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries (collectively “Apple” or the “Company”). Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. In the opinion of the Company’s management, the consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments, which are normal and recurring in nature, necessary for fair financial statement presentation. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates. Certain prior period amounts in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been reclassified to conform to the current period’s presentation.The Company’s fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week period that ends on the last Saturday of September. An additional week is included in the first fiscal quarter every five or six years to realign the Company’s fiscal quarters with calendar quarters. The Company’s fiscal years 2021, 2020 and 2019 spanned 52 weeks each. Unless otherwise stated, references to particular years, quarters, months and periods refer to the Company’s fiscal years ended in September and the associated quarters, months and periods of those fiscal years.Recently Adopted Accounting PronouncementsFinancial Instruments – Credit LossesAt the beginning of the first quarter of 2021, the Company adopted the Financial Accounting Standards Board’s (the “FASB”) Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments – Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments (“ASU 2016-13”), which modifies the measurement of expected credit losses on certain financial instruments. The Company adopted ASU 2016-13 utilizing the modified retrospective transition method. The adoption of ASU 2016-13 did not have a material impact on the Company’s condensed consolidated financial statements.Advertising CostsAdvertising costs are expensed as incurred and included in selling, general and administrative expenses.Share-Based CompensationThe Company generally measures share-based compensation based on the closing price of the Company’s common stock on the date of grant, and recognizes expense on a straight-line basis for its estimate of equity awards that will ultimately vest. Further information regarding share-based compensation can be found in Note 9, “Benefit Plans.”Earnings Per ShareThe following table shows the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share for 2021, 2020 and 2019 (net income in millions and shares in thousands):Apple Inc. | 2021 Form 10-K | 34



The Company applies the treasury stock method to determine the dilutive effect of potentially dilutive securities. Potentially dilutive securities representing 62 million shares of common stock were excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share for 2019 because their effect would have been antidilutive.Cash Equivalents and Marketable SecuritiesAll highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase are classified as cash equivalents.The Company’s investments in marketable debt securities have been classified and accounted for as available-for-sale. The Company classifies its marketable debt securities as either short-term or long-term based on each instrument’s underlying contractual maturity date. Unrealized gains and losses on marketable debt securities classified as available-for-sale are recognized in other comprehensive income/(loss) (“OCI”). The Company’s investments in marketable equity securities are classified based on the nature of the securities and their availability for use in current operations. The Company’s marketable equity securities are measured at fair value with gains and losses recognized in other income/(expense), net (“OI&E”).The cost of securities sold is determined using the specific identification method.InventoriesInventories are measured using the first-in, first-out method.Property, Plant and EquipmentDepreciation on property, plant and equipment is recognized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which for buildings is the lesser of 40 years or the remaining life of the building; between one and five years for machinery and equipment, including product tooling and manufacturing process equipment; and the shorter of lease term or useful life for leasehold improvements. Capitalized costs related to internal-use software are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which range from five to seven years. Depreciation and amortization expense on property and equipment was $9.5 billion, $9.7 billion and $11.3 billion during 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.Noncash investing activities involving property, plant and equipment resulted in a net decrease to accounts payable and other current liabilities of $2.9 billion during 2019.Restricted Cash and Restricted Marketable SecuritiesThe Company considers cash and marketable securities to be restricted when withdrawal or general use is legally restricted. The Company reports restricted cash as other assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, and determines current or non-current classification based on the expected duration of the restriction. The Company reports restricted marketable securities as current or non-current marketable securities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets based on the classification of the underlying securities.Derivative Instruments and HedgingAll derivative instruments are recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value. The accounting treatment for derivative gains and losses is based on intended use and hedge designation.Gains and losses arising from amounts that are included in the assessment of cash flow hedge effectiveness are initially deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss) (“AOCI”) and subsequently reclassified into earnings when the hedged transaction affects earnings, and in the same line item in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. For options designated as cash flow hedges, the Company excludes time value from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and recognizes it on a straight-line basis over the life of the hedge in the Consolidated Statements of Operations line item to which the hedge relates. Changes in the fair value of amounts excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness are recognized in OCI.Gains and losses arising from amounts that are included in the assessment of fair value hedge effectiveness are recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Operations line item to which the hedge relates along with offsetting losses and gains related to the change in value of the hedged item. For foreign exchange forward contracts designated as fair value hedges, the Company excludes the forward carry component from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and recognizes it in OI&E on a straight-line basis over the life of the hedge. Changes in the fair value of amounts excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness are recognized in OCI.Gains and losses arising from changes in the fair values of derivative instruments that are not designated as accounting hedges are recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Operations line items to which the derivative instruments relate.Apple Inc. | 2021 Form 10-K | 35



The Company presents derivative assets and liabilities at their gross fair values in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company classifies cash flows related to derivative instruments as operating activities in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.Fair Value MeasurementsThe fair values of the Company’s money market funds and certain marketable equity securities are based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets. The valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of the Company’s debt instruments and all other financial instruments, which generally have counterparties with high credit ratings, are based on quoted market prices or model-driven valuations using significant inputs derived from or corroborated by observable market data.Note 2 – Revenue RecognitionNet sales consist of revenue from the sale of iPhone, Mac, iPad, Services and other products. The Company recognizes revenue at the amount to which it expects to be entitled when control of the products or services is transferred to its customers. Control is generally transferred when the Company has a present right to payment and title and the significant risks and rewards of ownership of products or services are transferred to its customers. For most of the Company’s Products net sales, control transfers when products are shipped. For the Company’s Services net sales, control transfers over time as services are delivered. Payment for Products and Services net sales is collected within a short period following transfer of control or commencement of delivery of services, as applicable.The Company records reductions to Products net sales related to future product returns, price protection and other customer incentive programs based on the Company’s expectations and historical experience.For arrangements with multiple performance obligations, which represent promises within an arrangement that are distinct, the Company allocates revenue to all distinct performance obligations based on their relative stand-alone selling prices (“SSPs”). When available, the Company uses observable prices to determine SSPs. When observable prices are not available, SSPs are established that reflect the Company’s best estimates of what the selling prices of the performance obligations would be if they were sold regularly on a stand-alone basis. The Company’s process for estimating SSPs without observable prices considers multiple factors that may vary depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each performance obligation including, where applicable, prices charged by the Company for similar offerings, market trends in the pricing for similar offerings, product-specific business objectives and the estimated cost to provide the performance obligation.The Company has identified up to three performance obligations regularly included in arrangements involving the sale of iPhone, Mac, iPad and certain other products. The first performance obligation, which represents the substantial portion of the allocated sales price, is the hardware and bundled software delivered at the time of sale. The second performance obligation is the right to receive certain product-related bundled services, which include iCloud®, Siri and Maps. The third performance obligation is the right to receive, on a when-and-if-available basis, future unspecified software upgrades relating to the software bundled with each device. The Company allocates revenue and any related discounts to these performance obligations based on their relative SSPs. Because the Company lacks observable prices for the undelivered performance obligations, the allocation of revenue is based on the Company’s estimated SSPs. Revenue allocated to the delivered hardware and bundled software is recognized when control has transferred to the customer, which generally occurs when the product is shipped. Revenue allocated to the product-related bundled services and unspecified software upgrade rights is deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis over the estimated period they are expected to be provided. Cost of sales related to delivered hardware and bundled software, including estimated warranty costs, are recognized at the time of sale. Costs incurred to provide product-related bundled services and unspecified software upgrade rights are recognized as cost of sales as incurred.For certain long-term service arrangements, the Company has performance obligations for services it has not yet delivered. For these arrangements, the Company does not have a right to bill for the undelivered services. The Company has determined that any unbilled consideration relates entirely to the value of the undelivered services. Accordingly, the Company has not recognized revenue, and has elected not to disclose amounts, related to these undelivered services.For the sale of third-party products where the Company obtains control of the product before transferring it to the customer, the Company recognizes revenue based on the gross amount billed to customers. The Company considers multiple factors when determining whether it obtains control of third-party products including, but not limited to, evaluating if it can establish the price of the product, retains inventory risk for tangible products or has the responsibility for ensuring acceptability of the product. For third-party applications sold through the App Store and certain digital content sold through the Company’s other digital content stores, the Company does not obtain control of the product before transferring it to the customer. Therefore, the Company accounts for such sales on a net basis by recognizing in Services net sales only the commission it retains.The Company has elected to record revenue net of taxes collected from customers that are remitted to governmental authorities, with the collected taxes recorded within other current liabilities until remitted to the relevant government authority.Apple Inc. | 2021 Form 10-K | 36

Deferred RevenueAs of September 25, 2021 and September 26, 2020, the Company had total deferred revenue of $11.9 billion and $10.2 billion, respectively. As of September 25, 2021, the Company expects 64% of total deferred revenue to be realized in less than a year, 26% within one-to-two years, 8% within two-to-three years and 2% in greater than three years.Disaggregated RevenueNet sales disaggregated by significant products and services for 2021, 2020 and 2019 were as follows (in millions):(1)Products net sales include amortization of the deferred value of unspecified software upgrade rights, which are bundled in the sales price of the respective product.(2)Wearables, Home and Accessories net sales include sales of AirPods, Apple TV, Apple Watch, Beats products, HomePod, iPod touch and accessories.(3)Services net sales include sales from the Company’s advertising, AppleCare, cloud, digital content, payment and other services. Services net sales also include amortization of the deferred value of services bundled in the sales price of certain products.(4)Includes $6.7 billion of revenue recognized in 2021 that was included in deferred revenue as of September 26, 2020, $5.0 billion of revenue recognized in 2020 that was included in deferred revenue as of September 28, 2019, and $5.9 billion of revenue recognized in 2019 that was included in deferred revenue as of September 29, 2018.The Company’s proportion of net sales by disaggregated revenue source was generally consistent for each reportable segment in Note 11, “Segment Information and Geographic Data” for 2021, 2020 and 2019.Apple Inc. | 2021 Form 10-K | 37

The Company may sell certain of its marketable debt securities prior to their stated maturities for reasons including, but not limited to, managing liquidity, credit risk, duration and asset allocation. The following table shows the fair value of the Company’s non-current marketable debt securities, by contractual maturity, as of September 25, 2021 (in millions):The Company typically invests in highly rated securities, with the primary objective of minimizing the potential risk of principal loss. The Company’s investment policy generally requires securities to be investment grade and limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. Fair values were determined for each individual security in the investment portfolio.Derivative Instruments and HedgingThe Company may use derivative instruments to partially offset its business exposure to foreign exchange and interest rate risk. However, the Company may choose not to hedge certain exposures for a variety of reasons including, but not limited to, accounting considerations or the prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures. There can be no assurance the hedges will offset more than a portion of the financial impact resulting from movements in foreign exchange or interest rates.Foreign Exchange RiskTo protect gross margins from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, the Company may enter into forward contracts, option contracts or other instruments, and may designate these instruments as cash flow hedges. The Company generally hedges portions of its forecasted foreign currency exposure associated with revenue and inventory purchases, typically for up to 12 months.To protect the Company’s foreign currency–denominated term debt or marketable securities from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, the Company may enter into forward contracts, cross-currency swaps or other instruments. The Company designates these instruments as either cash flow or fair value hedges. As of September 25, 2021, the Company’s hedged term debt– and marketable securities–related foreign currency transactions are expected to be recognized within 21 years.The Company may also enter into derivative instruments that are not designated as accounting hedges to protect gross margins from certain fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, as well as to offset a portion of the foreign currency exchange gains and losses generated by the remeasurement of certain assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies.Interest Rate RiskTo protect the Company’s term debt or marketable securities from fluctuations in interest rates, the Company may enter into interest rate swaps, options or other instruments. The Company designates these instruments as either cash flow or fair value hedges.The notional amounts of the Company’s outstanding derivative instruments as of September 25, 2021 and September 26, 2020 were as follows (in millions):The gross fair values of the Company’s derivative assets and liabilities were not material as of September 25, 2021 and September 26, 2020.The gains and losses recognized in OCI and amounts reclassified from AOCI to net income for the Company’s derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges were not material in 2021, 2020 and 2019.Apple Inc. | 2021 Form 10-K | 39

The carrying amounts of the Company’s hedged items in fair value hedges as of September 25, 2021 and September 26, 2020 were as follows (in millions):The gains and losses on the Company’s derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges and the related hedged item adjustments were not material in 2021, 2020 and 2019.Accounts ReceivableTrade ReceivablesThe Company has considerable trade receivables outstanding with its third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers, resellers, small and mid-sized businesses and education, enterprise and government customers. The Company generally does not require collateral from its customers; however, the Company will require collateral or third-party credit support in certain instances to limit credit risk. In addition, when possible, the Company attempts to limit credit risk on trade receivables with credit insurance for certain customers or by requiring third-party financing, loans or leases to support credit exposure. These credit-financing arrangements are directly between the third-party financing company and the end customer. As such, the Company generally does not assume any recourse or credit risk sharing related to any of these arrangements.As of both September 25, 2021 and September 26, 2020, the Company had no customers that individually represented 10% or more of total trade receivables. The Company’s cellular network carriers accounted for 42% of total trade receivables as of September 25, 2021.Vendor Non-Trade ReceivablesThe Company has non-trade receivables from certain of its manufacturing vendors resulting from the sale of components to these vendors who manufacture subassemblies or assemble final products for the Company. The Company purchases these components directly from suppliers. As of September 25, 2021, the Company had three vendors that individually represented 10% or more of total vendor non-trade receivables, which accounted for 52%, 11% and 11%. As of September 26, 2020, the Company had two vendors that individually represented 10% or more of total vendor non-trade receivables, which accounted for 57% and 11%.Note 4 – Consolidated Financial Statement DetailsThe following tables show the Company’s consolidated financial statement details as of September 25, 2021 and September 26, 2020 (in millions):Property, Plant and Equipment, NetOther Non-Current LiabilitiesApple Inc. | 2021 Form 10-K | 40

Deferred Tax Assets and LiabilitiesAs of September 25, 2021 and September 26, 2020, the significant components of the Company’s deferred tax assets and liabilities were (in millions):Deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect the effects of tax credits and the future income tax effects of temporary differences between the consolidated financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, and are measured using enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The Company has elected to record certain deferred tax assets and liabilities in connection with the minimum tax on certain foreign earnings created by the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the “Act”).As of September 25, 2021, the Company had $2.6 billion in foreign tax credit carryforwards in Ireland and $1.6 billion in California research and development credit carryforwards, both of which can be carried forward indefinitely. A valuation allowance has been recorded for the tax credit carryforwards and a portion of other temporary differences.Uncertain Tax PositionsAs of September 25, 2021, the total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits was $15.5 billion, of which $6.6 billion, if recognized, would impact the Company’s effective tax rate. As of September 26, 2020, the total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits was $16.5 billion, of which $8.8 billion, if recognized, would have impacted the Company’s effective tax rate.The aggregate change in the balance of gross unrecognized tax benefits, which excludes interest and penalties, for 2021, 2020 and 2019, is as follows (in millions):The Company is subject to taxation and files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and many state and foreign jurisdictions. Tax years after 2015 for the U.S. federal jurisdiction, and after 2014 in certain major foreign jurisdictions, remain subject to examination. Although the timing of resolution and/or closure of examinations is not certain, the Company believes it is reasonably possible that its gross unrecognized tax benefits could decrease in the next 12 months by as much as $1.2 billion.Apple Inc. | 2021 Form 10-K | 42

Interest and PenaltiesThe Company includes interest and penalties related to income tax matters within the provision for income taxes. As of September 25, 2021 and September 26, 2020, the total amount of gross interest and penalties accrued was $1.5 billion and $1.4 billion, respectively. The Company recognized interest and penalty expense of $219 million, $85 million and $73 million in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.European Commission State Aid DecisionOn August 30, 2016, the European Commission announced its decision that Ireland granted state aid to the Company by providing tax opinions in 1991 and 2007 concerning the tax allocation of profits of the Irish branches of two subsidiaries of the Company (the “State Aid Decision”). The State Aid Decision ordered Ireland to calculate and recover additional taxes from the Company for the period June 2003 through December 2014. Irish legislative changes, effective as of January 2015, eliminated the application of the tax opinions from that date forward. The recovery amount was calculated to be €13.1 billion, plus interest of €1.2 billion. The Company and Ireland appealed the State Aid Decision to the General Court of the Court of Justice of the European Union (the “General Court”). On July 15, 2020, the General Court annulled the State Aid Decision. On September 25, 2020, the European Commission appealed the General Court’s decision to the European Court of Justice. The Company believes that any incremental Irish corporate income taxes potentially due related to the State Aid Decision would be creditable against U.S. taxes, subject to any foreign tax credit limitations in the Act.On an annual basis, the Company may request approval from the Irish Minister for Finance to reduce the recovery amount for certain taxes paid to other countries. As of September 25, 2021, the adjusted recovery amount was €12.7 billion, excluding interest. The adjusted recovery amount plus interest is funded into escrow, where it will remain restricted from general use pending the conclusion of all legal proceedings. Refer to the Cash, Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities section of Note 3, “Financial Instruments” for more information.Note 6 – LeasesThe Company has lease arrangements for certain equipment and facilities, including retail, corporate, manufacturing and data center space. These leases typically have original terms not exceeding 10 years and generally contain multiyear renewal options, some of which are reasonably certain of exercise. The Company’s lease arrangements may contain both lease and nonlease components. The Company has elected to combine and account for lease and nonlease components as a single lease component for leases of retail, corporate, and data center facilities.Payments under the Company’s lease arrangements may be fixed or variable, and variable lease payments are primarily based on purchases of output of the underlying leased assets. Lease costs associated with fixed payments on the Company’s operating leases were $1.7 billion and $1.5 billion for 2021 and 2020, respectively. Lease costs associated with variable payments on the Company’s leases were $12.9 billion and $9.3 billion for 2021 and 2020, respectively. Rent expense for operating leases, as previously reported under former lease accounting standards, was $1.3 billion in 2019.The Company made $1.4 billion and $1.5 billion of fixed cash payments related to operating leases in 2021 and 2020, respectively. Noncash activities involving right-of-use (“ROU”) assets obtained in exchange for lease liabilities were $3.3 billion for 2021 and $10.5 billion for 2020, including the impact of adopting FASB ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) in the first quarter of 2020.The following table shows ROU assets and lease liabilities, and the associated financial statement line items, as of September 25, 2021 and September 26, 2020 (in millions):Apple Inc. | 2021 Form 10-K | 43

Lease liability maturities as of September 25, 2021, are as follows (in millions):The weighted-average remaining lease term related to the Company’s lease liabilities as of September 25, 2021 and September 26, 2020 was 10.8 years and 10.3 years, respectively.The discount rate related to the Company’s lease liabilities as of both September 25, 2021 and September 26, 2020 was 2.0%. The discount rates are generally based on estimates of the Company’s incremental borrowing rate, as the discount rates implicit in the Company’s leases cannot be readily determined.As of September 25, 2021, the Company had $1.1 billion of future payments under additional leases, primarily for corporate facilities and retail space, that had not yet commenced. These leases will commence between 2022 and 2023, with lease terms ranging from 3 years to 20 years.Note 7 – DebtCommercial Paper and Repurchase AgreementsThe Company issues unsecured short-term promissory notes (“Commercial Paper”) pursuant to a commercial paper program. The Company uses net proceeds from the commercial paper program for general corporate purposes, including dividends and share repurchases. As of September 25, 2021 and September 26, 2020, the Company had $6.0 billion and $5.0 billion of Commercial Paper outstanding, respectively, with maturities generally less than nine months. The weighted-average interest rate of the Company’s Commercial Paper was 0.06% and 0.62% as of September 25, 2021 and September 26, 2020, respectively. The following table provides a summary of cash flows associated with the issuance and maturities of Commercial Paper for 2021, 2020 and 2019 (in millions):In 2020, the Company entered into agreements to sell certain of its marketable securities with a promise to repurchase the securities at a specified time and amount (“Repos”). Due to the Company’s continuing involvement with the marketable securities, the Company accounted for its Repos as collateralized borrowings. The Company entered into $5.2 billion of Repos during 2020, all of which had been settled as of September 26, 2020.Apple Inc. | 2021 Form 10-K | 44

Term DebtAs of September 25, 2021, the Company had outstanding floating- and fixed-rate notes with varying maturities for an aggregate principal amount of $118.1 billion (collectively the “Notes”). The Notes are senior unsecured obligations and interest is payable in arrears. The following table provides a summary of the Company’s term debt as of September 25, 2021 and September 26, 2020:To manage interest rate risk on certain of its U.S. dollar–denominated fixed- or floating-rate notes, the Company has entered into interest rate swaps to effectively convert the fixed interest rates to floating interest rates or the floating interest rates to fixed interest rates on a portion of these notes. Additionally, to manage foreign currency risk on certain of its foreign currency–denominated notes, the Company has entered into foreign currency swaps to effectively convert these notes to U.S. dollar–denominated notes.The effective interest rates for the Notes include the interest on the Notes, amortization of the discount or premium and, if applicable, adjustments related to hedging. The Company recognized $2.6 billion, $2.8 billion and $3.2 billion of interest expense on its term debt for 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.The future principal payments for the Company’s Notes as of September 25, 2021, are as follows (in millions):As of September 25, 2021 and September 26, 2020, the fair value of the Company’s Notes, based on Level 2 inputs, was $125.3 billion and $117.1 billion, respectively.Apple Inc. | 2021 Form 10-K | 45

Note 8 – Shareholders’ EquityShare Repurchase ProgramAs of September 25, 2021, the Company was authorized to purchase up to $315 billion of the Company’s common stock under a share repurchase program (the “Program”). During 2021, the Company repurchased 656 million shares of its common stock for $85.5 billion, including 36 million shares delivered under a $5.0 billion accelerated share repurchase agreement entered into in May 2021, bringing the total utilization under the Program to $254.1 billion as of September 25, 2021. The Program does not obligate the Company to acquire any specific number of shares. Under the Program, shares may be repurchased in privately negotiated and/or open market transactions, including under plans complying with Rule 10b5-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”).Shares of Common StockThe following table shows the changes in shares of common stock for 2021, 2020 and 2019 (in thousands):Note 9 – Benefit Plans2014 Employee Stock PlanThe 2014 Employee Stock Plan (the “2014 Plan”) is a shareholder-approved plan that provides for broad-based equity grants to employees, including executive officers, and permits the granting of restricted stock units (“RSUs”), stock grants, performance-based awards, stock options and stock appreciation rights, as well as cash bonus awards. RSUs granted under the 2014 Plan generally vest over four years, based on continued employment, and are settled upon vesting in shares of the Company’s common stock on a one-for-one basis. RSUs granted under the 2014 Plan reduce the number of shares available for grant under the plan by a factor of two times the number of RSUs granted. RSUs canceled and shares withheld to satisfy tax withholding obligations increase the number of shares available for grant under the 2014 Plan utilizing a factor of two times the number of RSUs canceled or shares withheld. All RSUs granted under the 2014 Plan have dividend equivalent rights (“DERs”), which entitle holders of RSUs to the same dividend value per share as holders of common stock. DERs are subject to the same vesting and other terms and conditions as the underlying RSUs. As of September 25, 2021, approximately 760 million shares were reserved for future issuance under the 2014 Plan. Shares subject to outstanding awards under the 2003 Employee Stock Plan that expire, are canceled or otherwise terminate, or are withheld to satisfy tax withholding obligations for RSUs, will also be available for awards under the 2014 Plan.Apple Inc. Non-Employee Director Stock PlanThe Apple Inc. Non-Employee Director Stock Plan (the “Director Plan”) is a shareholder-approved plan that (i) permits the Company to grant awards of RSUs or stock options to the Company’s non-employee directors, (ii) provides for automatic initial grants of RSUs upon a non-employee director joining the Board of Directors and automatic annual grants of RSUs at each annual meeting of shareholders, and (iii) permits the Board of Directors to prospectively change the value and relative mixture of stock options and RSUs for the initial and annual award grants and the methodology for determining the number of shares of the Company’s common stock subject to these grants, in each case within the limits set forth in the Director Plan and without further shareholder approval. RSUs granted under the Director Plan reduce the number of shares available for grant under the plan by a factor of two times the number of RSUs granted. The Director Plan expires on November 12, 2027. All RSUs granted under the Director Plan are entitled to DERs, which are subject to the same vesting and other terms and conditions as the underlying RSUs. As of September 25, 2021, approximately 4 million shares were reserved for future issuance under the Director Plan.Rule 10b5-1 Trading PlansDuring the three months ended September 25, 2021, Section 16 officers Katherine L. Adams, Timothy D. Cook, Luca Maestri, Deirdre O’Brien and Jeffrey Williams had equity trading plans in place in accordance with Rule 10b5-1(c)(1) under the Exchange Act. An equity trading plan is a written document that preestablishes the amounts, prices and dates (or formula for determining the amounts, prices and dates) of future purchases or sales of the Company’s stock, including shares acquired under the Company’s employee and director equity plans.Apple Inc. | 2021 Form 10-K | 46

Employee Stock Purchase PlanThe Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the “Purchase Plan”) is a shareholder-approved plan under which substantially all employees may voluntarily enroll to purchase the Company’s common stock through payroll deductions at a price equal to 85% of the lower of the fair market values of the stock as of the beginning or the end of six-month offering periods. An employee’s payroll deductions under the Purchase Plan are limited to 10% of the employee’s compensation and employees may not purchase more than $25,000 of stock during any calendar year. As of September 25, 2021, approximately 96 million shares were reserved for future issuance under the Purchase Plan.401(k) PlanThe Company’s 401(k) Plan is a deferred salary arrangement under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code. Under the 401(k) Plan, participating U.S. employees may defer a portion of their pretax earnings, up to the U.S. Internal Revenue Service annual contribution limit ($19,500 for calendar year 2021). The Company matches 50% to 100% of each employee’s contributions, depending on length of service, up to a maximum of 6% of the employee’s eligible earnings.Restricted Stock UnitsA summary of the Company’s RSU activity and related information for 2021, 2020 and 2019, is as follows:The fair value as of the respective vesting dates of RSUs was $19.0 billion, $10.8 billion and $8.6 billion for 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The majority of RSUs that vested in 2021, 2020 and 2019 were net share settled such that the Company withheld shares with a value equivalent to the employees’ obligation for the applicable income and other employment taxes, and remitted the cash to the appropriate taxing authorities. The total shares withheld were approximately 53 million, 56 million and 59 million for 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively, and were based on the value of the RSUs on their respective vesting dates as determined by the Company’s closing stock price. Total payments for the employees’ tax obligations to taxing authorities were $6.8 billion, $3.9 billion and $3.0 billion in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.Share-Based CompensationThe following table shows share-based compensation expense and the related income tax benefit included in the Consolidated Statements of Operations for 2021, 2020 and 2019 (in millions):As of September 25, 2021, the total unrecognized compensation cost related to outstanding RSUs and stock options was $13.6 billion, which the Company expects to recognize over a weighted-average period of 2.5 years.Apple Inc. | 2021 Form 10-K | 47

Note 10 – Commitments and ContingenciesAccrued Warranty and GuaranteesThe following table shows changes in the Company’s accrued warranties and related costs for 2021, 2020 and 2019 (in millions):The Company offers an iPhone Upgrade Program, which is available to customers who purchase a qualifying iPhone in the U.S., the U.K. and China mainland. The iPhone Upgrade Program provides customers the right to trade in that iPhone for a specified amount when purchasing a new iPhone, provided certain conditions are met. The Company accounts for the trade-in right as a guarantee liability and recognizes arrangement revenue net of the fair value of such right, with subsequent changes to the guarantee liability recognized within net sales.Concentrations in the Available Sources of Supply of Materials and ProductAlthough most components essential to the Company’s business are generally available from multiple sources, certain components are currently obtained from single or limited sources. The Company also competes for various components with other participants in the markets for smartphones, personal computers, tablets, wearables and accessories. Therefore, many components used by the Company, including those that are available from multiple sources, are at times subject to industry-wide shortage and significant commodity pricing fluctuations.The Company uses some custom components that are not commonly used by its competitors, and new products introduced by the Company often utilize custom components available from only one source. When a component or product uses new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers’ yields have matured or their manufacturing capacities have increased. The continued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at all, may be affected if suppliers decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the Company’s requirements.The Company has entered into agreements for the supply of many components; however, there can be no guarantee that the Company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms, or at all.Substantially all of the Company’s hardware products are manufactured by outsourcing partners that are located primarily in Asia, with some Mac computers manufactured in the U.S. and Ireland.Unconditional Purchase ObligationsThe Company has entered into certain off–balance sheet commitments that require the future purchase of goods or services (“unconditional purchase obligations”). The Company’s unconditional purchase obligations primarily consist of payments for content creation, Internet and telecommunications services and supplier arrangements. Future payments under noncancelable unconditional purchase obligations having a remaining term in excess of one year as of September 25, 2021, are as follows (in millions):Apple Inc. | 2021 Form 10-K | 48



ContingenciesThe Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that have arisen in the ordinary course of business and that have not been fully resolved. The outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain. When a loss related to a legal proceeding or claim is probable and reasonably estimable, the Company accrues its best estimate for the ultimate resolution of the matter. If one or more legal matters were resolved against the Company in a reporting period for amounts above management’s expectations, the Company’s financial condition and operating results for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected. In the opinion of management, there was not at least a reasonable possibility the Company may have incurred a material loss, or a material loss greater than a recorded accrual, concerning loss contingencies for asserted legal and other claims, except for the following matters:VirnetXVirnetX, Inc. (“VirnetX”) filed a lawsuit against the Company alleging that certain of the Company’s products infringe on patents owned by VirnetX. On April 11, 2018, a jury returned a verdict against the Company in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas (the “Eastern Texas District Court”). The Company appealed the verdict to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, which remanded the case back to the Eastern Texas District Court, where a retrial was held in October 2020. The jury returned a verdict against the Company and awarded damages of $503 million, which the Company has appealed. The Company has challenged the validity of the patents at issue in the retrial at the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (the “PTO”), and the PTO has declared the patents invalid, subject to further appeal by VirnetX.iOS Performance Management CasesOn April 5, 2018, several U.S. federal actions alleging violation of consumer protection laws, fraud, computer intrusion and other causes of action related to the Company’s performance management feature used in its iPhone operating systems, introduced to certain iPhones in iOS updates 10.2.1 and 11.2, were consolidated through a Multidistrict Litigation process into a single action in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California (the “Northern California District Court”). On February 28, 2020, the parties in the Multidistrict Litigation reached a settlement to resolve the U.S. federal and California state class actions. On March 18, 2021, the Northern California District Court granted final approval of the Multidistrict Litigation settlement, which will result in an aggregate payment of $310 million to settle all claims. The Company continues to believe that its iPhones were not defective, that the performance management feature introduced with iOS updates 10.2.1 and 11.2 was intended to, and did, improve customers’ user experience, and that the Company did not make any misleading statements or fail to disclose any material information.French Competition AuthorityOn March 16, 2020, the French Competition Authority (“FCA”) announced its decision that aspects of the Company’s sales and distribution practices in France violate French competition law, and issued a fine of €1.1 billion. The Company strongly disagrees with the FCA’s decision, and has appealed.OptisOptis Wireless Technology, LLC and related entities (“Optis”) filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas against the Company alleging that certain of the Company’s products infringe on patents owned by Optis. On August 11, 2020, a jury returned a verdict against the Company and awarded damages. In post-trial proceedings, the damages portion of the verdict was set aside. A retrial on damages was held in August 2021 and the jury in that proceeding awarded damages of $300 million against the Company, which the Company plans to appeal.Note 11 – Segment Information and Geographic DataThe Company reports segment information based on the “management” approach. The management approach designates the internal reporting used by management for making decisions and assessing performance as the source of the Company’s reportable segments.The Company manages its business primarily on a geographic basis. The Company’s reportable segments consist of the Americas, Europe, Greater China, Japan and Rest of Asia Pacific. Americas includes both North and South America. Europe includes European countries, as well as India, the Middle East and Africa. Greater China includes China mainland, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Rest of Asia Pacific includes Australia and those Asian countries not included in the Company’s other reportable segments. Although the reportable segments provide similar hardware and software products and similar services, each one is managed separately to better align with the location of the Company’s customers and distribution partners and the unique market dynamics of each geographic region. The accounting policies of the various segments are the same as those described in Note 1, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.”Apple Inc. | 2021 Form 10-K | 49

The Company evaluates the performance of its reportable segments based on net sales and operating income. Net sales for geographic segments are generally based on the location of customers and sales through the Company’s retail stores located in those geographic locations. Operating income for each segment includes net sales to third parties, related cost of sales and operating expenses directly attributable to the segment. Advertising expenses are generally included in the geographic segment in which the expenditures are incurred. Operating income for each segment excludes other income and expense and certain expenses managed outside the reportable segments. Costs excluded from segment operating income include various corporate expenses such as research and development, corporate marketing expenses, certain share-based compensation expenses, income taxes, various nonrecurring charges and other separately managed general and administrative costs. The Company does not include intercompany transfers between segments for management reporting purposes.The following table shows information by reportable segment for 2021, 2020 and 2019 (in millions):A reconciliation of the Company’s segment operating income to the Consolidated Statements of Operations for 2021, 2020 and 2019 is as follows (in millions):Apple Inc. | 2021 Form 10-K | 50

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting FirmTo the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of Apple Inc.Opinion on Internal Control Over Financial ReportingWe have audited Apple Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of September 25, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the “COSO criteria”).

Our responsibility is to express an opinion on Apple Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to Apple Inc. in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial ReportingA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate./s/ Ernst & Young LLPSan Jose, CaliforniaOctober 28, 2021Apple Inc. | 2021 Form 10-K | 54



Item 9.    Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial DisclosureNone.Item 9A.    Controls and ProceduresEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and ProceduresBased on an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of the Company’s management, the Company’s principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act were effective as of September 25, 2021 to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC rules and forms and (ii) accumulated and communicated to the Company’s management, including its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.Inherent Limitations over Internal ControlsThe Company’s internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). The Company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: (i)pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the Company’s assets;(ii)provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and that the Company’s receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of the Company’s management and directors; and(iii)provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the Company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.Management, including the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that the Company’s internal controls will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of internal controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. Also, any evaluation of the effectiveness of controls in future periods are subject to the risk that those internal controls may become inadequate because of changes in business conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial ReportingThe Company’s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act). Management conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria set forth in Internal Control – Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework). Based on the Company’s assessment, management has concluded that its internal control over financial reporting was effective as of September 25, 2021 to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP. The Company’s independent registered public accounting firm, Ernst & Young LLP, has issued an audit report on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting, which appears in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K.Changes in Internal Control over Financial ReportingThere were no changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting during the fourth quarter of 2021, which were identified in connection with management’s evaluation required by paragraph (d) of Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.Apple Inc. | 2021 Form 10-K | 55
